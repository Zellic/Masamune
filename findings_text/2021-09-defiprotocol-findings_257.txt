# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In Basket.sol, there is a function `mintTo(uint256 amount, address to)`. It's best practice to use as first argument `to`, and as second `amount`; see also the order used in L84 (_mint(to, amount)) and L86 (Minted(to, amount)).  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L76  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider switching the arguments (also don't forget to change the calls to the function).
