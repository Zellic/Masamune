# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter should checked for success.  See `Unlock.recordKeyPurchase` which performs ERC20 transfers without checking for the return value.  ## Impact As the trusted `udt` token is used which supposedly reverts on failed transfers, not checking the return value does not lead to any security issues. We still recommend checking it to abide by the EIP20 standard.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider using `require(IMintableERC20(udt).transfer(_referrer, tokensToDistribute - devReward), "transfer failed")` instead.
