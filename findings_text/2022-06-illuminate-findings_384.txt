So if no `msg.sender` has a positive balance funds will be lost.   Now assuming the goal of calling `redeem` for Illuminate [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/redeemer/Redeemer.sol#L116) is for users to redeem their Illuminate principal and receive the underlying as suggested by this [comment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/redeemer/Redeemer.sol#L127), then the underlying is not sent back to users because `Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount);` send the funds to the redeemer, not the user.    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Clarify the purpose of this function and fix the corresponding bug.
