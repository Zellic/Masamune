# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Suppose you try to build a position and have set the _leverage accidentally to 0  (which can be done if you call the smart contract directly). Then the function build() will call enterOI() which will revert when trying to calculate debtAdjusted_ .  However no user friendly error message is given.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/market/OverlayV1Market.sol ```JS function enterOI ( bool _isLong,  uint _collateral,  uint _leverage ) external onlyCollateral returns (...) {  ...         collateralAdjusted_ = _collateral - _impact - fee_;       // will be > 0         oiAdjusted_ = collateralAdjusted_ * _leverage;            // if _leverage==0 then oiAdjusted_  == 0         debtAdjusted_ = oiAdjusted_ - collateralAdjusted_;   // will be negative and thus will revert ```     ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add something like the following to the function build() require(_leverage != 0, "OVLV1:leverage==0")
