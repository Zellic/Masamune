In the given CheckpointMath.md file it is stated that checkpoint details for  **increaseUnlockTime** function should be :  |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | owner.end  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    BUT with this error  you get a different checkpoint details :   |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | T  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    The error is illustrated in the code below :  ```         LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];         uint256 unlock_time = _floorToWeek(_unlockTime); // Locktime is rounded down to weeks         /* @audit comment                  the unlock_time represent the newLock end time         */         // Validate inputs         require(locked_.amount > 0, "No lock");         require(unlock_time > locked_.end, "Only increase lock end");         require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, "Exceeds maxtime");         // Update lock         uint256 oldUnlockTime = locked_.end;         locked_.end = unlock_time;         /* @audit comment                  The locked_ end time is update from  oldUnlockTime  ==>  unlock_time         */         locked[msg.sender] = locked_;         if (locked_.delegatee == msg.sender) {             // Undelegated lock             require(oldUnlockTime > block.timestamp, "Lock expired");             LockedBalance memory oldLocked = _copyLock(locked_);             oldLocked.end = unlock_time;             /* @audit comment                  The oldLocked.end is set to unlock_time instead of   oldUnlockTime              */             _checkpoint(msg.sender, oldLocked, locked_);         } ```  The impact of this is when calculating the **userOldPoint.bias** in the **_checkpoint** function you get an incorrect value equal to **userNewPoint.bias** (because oldLocked.end == _newLocked.end which is wrong).  ``` 240        userOldPoint.bias = 241                    userOldPoint.slope * 242                    int128(int256(_oldLocked.end - block.timestamp)); ```  The wrong **userOldPoint.bias** value is later used to calculate and update the bias value for the new point in **PointHistory**.   ``` 359       lastPoint.bias = 360                  lastPoint.bias + 361                  userNewPoint.bias - 362                  userOldPoint.bias;  372       pointHistory[epoch] = lastPoint; ```  And added to that the wrong **oldLocked.end** is used to get oldSlopeDelta value which is used to update the **slopeChanges**.  ``` 271       oldSlopeDelta = slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end];  380       oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta + userOldPoint.slope; 381       if (_newLocked.end == _oldLocked.end) { 382                  oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta - userNewPoint.slope; // It was a new deposit, not extension 383        } 384       slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end] = oldSlopeDelta; ```   As the **PointHistory** and the **slopeChanges** values are used inside the functions **balanceOfAt()** ,  **_supplyAt()**,  **totalSupply()**,  **totalSupplyAt()** to calculate the voting power, THIS ERROR COULD GIVE WRONG VOTING POWER AT A GIVEN BLOCK OF A USER OR CAN GIVE WRONG TOTAL VOTING POWER.  ## Tools Used  Manual Audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The line 513 in the VotingEscrow.sol contract :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = unlock_time; ```  Need to be replaced with the following :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = oldUnlockTime; ```
