# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The pattern of adding/subtracting a variable to/from another value is sometimes written as x += y; and sometimes as x = x + y; (x -= y; and sometimes x = x - y;) The shorter version x += y;/x -= y; increases readability.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L241  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L256  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L229  and possible others  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps use the x += y; / x -= y; pattern
