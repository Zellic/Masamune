# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The functions `ETHPoolDelegator.balances()` and `ETHPoolDelegator.coins()` accept an argument called `i` and use it as an index to determine which element in the `_balances` / `_coins` array should be loaded and returned. However, these functions don't check that the index they receive as an argument actually fits the bounds of the array.  ## Impact If the index exceeds the array length, there will be a revert with no informative error message. The user wouldn't know what caused the revert.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an appropriate require statement to each of these functions to validate that the given argument fits the `_balances` / `_coins` array bounds.
