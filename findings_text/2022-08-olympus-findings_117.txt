This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries.  Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds , because if `safetransfer()` and `safetransferfrom()` are called on a token address that doesn't have contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds has been transferred and successful , and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality funds were never transferred.  So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L110 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L99  ## Tools Used Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 or implement a code existence check
