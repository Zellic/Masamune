# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The treasury manager contract holds harvested assets/`COMP` from Notional which are used to perform `NOTE` buybacks or in other areas of the protocol. The manager account is allowed to sign off-chain orders used on 0x to exchange tokens to `WETH` which can then be deposited in the Balancer LP and distributed to `sNOTE` holders.  However, `_validateOrder` does not validate that `takerFee` and `makerFee` are set to zero, hence, it is possible for a malicious manager to receive tokens as part of a swap, but the treasury manager contract receives zero tokens as `makerFee` is set to the amount the maker receives. This can be abused to effectively burn treasury tokens at no cost to the order taker.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/0571244e9e84b9ad778bccb99b837dd6f9baaf6e/contracts/exchange/contracts/src/MixinExchangeCore.sol#L196-L250  https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/0571244e9e84b9ad778bccb99b837dd6f9baaf6e/contracts/exchange-libs/contracts/src/LibFillResults.sol#L59-L91  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/utils/EIP1271Wallet.sol#L147-L188 ``` function _validateOrder(bytes memory order) private view {     (         address makerToken,         address takerToken,         address feeRecipient,         uint256 makerAmount,         uint256 takerAmount     ) = _extractOrderInfo(order);      // No fee recipient allowed     require(feeRecipient == address(0), "no fee recipient allowed");      // MakerToken should never be WETH     require(makerToken != address(WETH), "maker token must not be WETH");      // TakerToken (proceeds) should always be WETH     require(takerToken == address(WETH), "taker token must be WETH");      address priceOracle = priceOracles[makerToken];      // Price oracle not defined     require(priceOracle != address(0), "price oracle not defined");      uint256 slippageLimit = slippageLimits[makerToken];      // Slippage limit not defined     require(slippageLimit != 0, "slippage limit not defined");      uint256 oraclePrice = _toUint(         AggregatorV2V3Interface(priceOracle).latestAnswer()     );      uint256 priceFloor = (oraclePrice * slippageLimit) /         SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION;      uint256 makerDecimals = 10**ERC20(makerToken).decimals();      // makerPrice = takerAmount / makerAmount     uint256 makerPrice = (takerAmount * makerDecimals) / makerAmount;      require(makerPrice >= priceFloor, "slippage is too high"); } ```  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider checking that `makerFee == 0` and `takerFee == 0` in `EIP1271Wallet._validateOrder` s.t. the treasury manager cannot sign unfair orders which severely impact the `TreasuryManager` contract.
