# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The functions `Factory.proposal()`, `Factory.getProposalWeights()` and `Factory.createBasket()` accept an argument called `proposalId`, `id` or `idNumber`, respectively, and use it as an index to determine which element in the `_proposals` array should be loaded and treated. However, these functions don't check that the index they receive as an argument actually fits the bounds of the `_proposals` array.  ## Impact If the index exceed the array length, there will be a revert with no informative error message. The user wouldn't know what caused the revert.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an appropriate require statement to each of these functions to validate that the given argument fits the `_proposals` array bounds.
