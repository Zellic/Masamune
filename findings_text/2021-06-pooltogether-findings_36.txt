# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The loop iteration in _tokenTotalSupply() ends when currentToken matches _tokens.end() where _tokens is a state variable.  Impact: Checking against the state variable for every iteration costs 100 gas per iteration. Even with only two controlled tokens (tickets & sponsorship), this costs 100 more than caching this in a local memory variable and using that within the while predicate.   ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L1059  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L177   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Cache _tokens.end() in a local memory variable before the loop and using that within the while predicate.
