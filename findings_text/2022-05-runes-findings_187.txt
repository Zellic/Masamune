Since there are no payable receive function in `ForgottenRunesWarriorsMinter`, the owner won't be able to replenish the contract for the refund process.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-runes/blob/060b4f82b79c8308fe65674a39a07c44fa586cd3/contracts/ForgottenRunesWarriorsMinter.sol#L616-L619  ```solidity     function withdrawAll() public payable onlyOwner {         require(address(vault) != address(0), 'no vault');         require(payable(vault).send(address(this).balance));     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Only allow owner to call `withdrawAll` after refund period
