# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact external function transferToPool is pretty useless and error-prone. It relies on the user not to leave these tokens in a separate tx, otherwise, it will just be feeding the bots. To use it directly users will have to write their own custom smart contract and chain actions.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It would be better to remove this function and leave the only way to invoke it via a batch function.
