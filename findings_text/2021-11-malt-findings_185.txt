# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Malt Finance uses solidity version `>=0.6.6` throughout all of its contracts. This solidity version provides no protections against arithmetic underflows and overflows. As a result, it is incredibly difficult to guarantee that the protocol enforces the necessary arithmetic checks during sensitive actions.  There are several instances where the OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library is not used. This exposes the protocol to potential exploits via arithmetic underflows and overflows. The liveness of the protocol depends on safety guarantees that are not provided/enforced. Therefore, this issue should be deemed high severity.  ## Proof of Concept  Solidity version shown in all contracts.  ## Tools Used  Manual code review. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/080-breaking-changes.html  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider updating the smart contract suite to use the latest solidity version or at the very least integrate OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library in all areas of the code containing arithmetic operations.
