# Handle  TimmyToes   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Including unused libraries could potentially use up gas and certainly makes the code more difficult to understand, hindering developer integrations/poor confused security auditors.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/adapters/YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#L19 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/adapters/YearnVaultAdapter.sol#L19 The contract does not use FixedPointMath and compiles with these lines removed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove line 10,19 from each contract (FixedPointMath lines). I'd also prefer the removal of  import "hardhat/console.sol"; but this is not having any impact and is just to tidy and shorten the files.
