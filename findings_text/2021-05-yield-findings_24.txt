# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  `Ladle._close` (and many other occurrences) reverts the transaction on certain signed inputs that are negated and cast to unsigned integers.  ```solidity // Ladle._close calling it with art or ink as type(int128).min will crash uint128 amt = _debtInBase(vault.seriesId, series, uint128(-art)); ilkJoin.exit(to, uint128(-ink))  // explanation int128 art = type(int128).min; // -2^127 uint128 amt = uint128(-art); // this fails as -art=--2^127=2^127 cannot be represented in int128 ```  Other places: - `CauldronMath.add` - `Ladle._pour` - everywhere where `-int*` is used  ## Impact One cannot use the actual `type(int128).min` value for function parameters.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Revert with a meaningful error message as is done in the `/math/Cast*` functions.
