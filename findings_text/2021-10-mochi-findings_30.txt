# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Detailed description of the impact of this finding.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/interfaces/IMochiVault.sol L6-L12: the struct can be reordered into struct Detail {     Status status;     address referrer;     uint256 collateral;     uint256 debt;     uint256 debtIndex; }  such that status and referrer are put into the same slot, should save ~2000 gas per borrow  ## Tools Used None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Reorder the struct as suggested, and modify impacted code at  IMochiVault.sol L28-L34 DutchAuctionLiquidator.sol L77  ## Extra Realistically, the range of debtIndex (start at 1e18 and increase by fee per year) probably fit in a uint88(11bytes) so you can pack (status(1byte), referrer(20bytes), debtIndex(11bytes)) all in 32 bytes, saving another storage slot.
