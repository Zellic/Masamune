# Handle  nikitastupin   # Vulnerability details  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-cssr/contracts/adapter/ChainlinkAdapter.sol#L49   The `ChainlinkAdapter` calls out to a Chainlink oracle receiving the `latestRoundData()`. If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the following checks:  ``` ... ( roundId, rawPrice, , updateTime, answeredInRound ) = AggregatorV3Interface(XXXXX).latestRoundData(); require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round"); require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price"); ... ```  ## References  - https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/09/fei-protocol-v2-phase-1/#chainlinkoraclewrapper-latestrounddata-might-return-stale-results - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside-findings/issues/70
