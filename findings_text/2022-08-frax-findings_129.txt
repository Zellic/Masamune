According to comments in FraxlendPairCore this should act as a constant/immutable value. Given that this value will be define through function **setTimeLock** in **FraxLendPair** contract this value can changed whenever the owner wants. This does not seem the expected behaviour.  ## Proof of Concept The owner can call whenever they want the function **setTimeLock**, which reset the value of **TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS**  ## Tools Used Manual read  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a bool which act as mutex if **TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS** has already been set, and modify **setTimeLock** function in FraxlendPair contract ```solidity // In FraxlendPair contract bool public timelockSetted; function setTimeLock(address _newAddress) external onlyOwner {         require(!timelockSetted);         emit SetTimeLock(TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS, _newAddress);         TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS = _newAddress;         timelockeSetted=true; } ```
