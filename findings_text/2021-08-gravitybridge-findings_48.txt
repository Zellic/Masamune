# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## State Variables that can be changed to `immutable`  [Solidity 0.6.5](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/04/06/solidity-0.6.5-release-announcement/) introduced `immutable` as a major feature. It allows setting contract-level variables at construction time which gets stored in code rather than storage.  Consider the following generic example:  ``` solidity contract C {     /// The owner is set during contruction time, and never changed afterwards.     address public owner = msg.sender; } ```  In the above example, each call to the function `owner()` reads from storage, using a `sload`. After [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929), this costs 2100 gas cold or 100 gas warm. However, the following snippet is more gas efficient:  ``` solidity contract C {     /// The owner is set during contruction time, and never changed afterwards.     address public immutable owner = msg.sender; } ```  In the above example, each storage read of the `owner` state variable is replaced by the instruction `push32 value`, where `value` is set during contract construction time. Unlike the last example, this costs only 3 gas.  ### Examples  1.  <https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L59> 2.  <https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L60>
