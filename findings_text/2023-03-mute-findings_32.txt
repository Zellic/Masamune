# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L185-L191   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There will be 2 impacts.  - The reward system would be broken as the rewards can be withdrawn before starting staking. - Some rewards would be locked inside the contract forever as it doesn't check `totalReclaimed`  ## Proof of Concept `rescueTokens()` checks the below condition to rescue `muteToken`.  ```solidity else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {     if (totalStakers > 0) {         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards)),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     } } ```  But there are 2 problems. 1. Currently, it doesn't check anything when `totalStakers == 0`. So some parts(or 100%) of rewards can be withdrawn before the staking period. In this case, the reward system won't work properly due to the lack of rewards. 2. It checks the wrong condition when `totalStakers > 0` as well. As we can see [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L241), some remaining rewards are tracked using `totalReclaimed` and transferred to treasury directly. So we should consider this amount as well.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It should be modified like the below.  ```solidity else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {     if (totalStakers > 0) { //should check totalReclaimed as well         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards).sub(totalReclaimed)),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     }     else if(block.timestamp <= endTime) { //no stakers but staking is still active, should maintain totalRewards         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     } } ```
