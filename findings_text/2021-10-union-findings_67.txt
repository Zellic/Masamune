# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UToken.repayBorrowWithPermit` function is missing the `repayBorrowWithPermit` modifier which the other repay functions (`repayBorrow`, `repayBorrowBehalf`) have.  ## Impact There's a possibility for re-entrancy. Even though I did not find a way to exploit it, it seems like this function should have the `nonReentrant` modifier as the other similar `repay*` functions have it as well.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add `nonReentrant` to `repayBorrowWithPermit`.
