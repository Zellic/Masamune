And in `declareReward()`, it calculates the `netVest` and `netTime` by subtracting the previous amount and time.  ```solidity File: 2023-02-malt\contracts\RewardSystem\LinearDistributor.sol 112:     uint256 currentlyVested = vestingDistributor.getCurrentlyVested(); 113:  114:     uint256 netVest = currentlyVested - previouslyVested; //@audit revert after change vestingDistributor 115:     uint256 netTime = block.timestamp - previouslyVestedTimestamp; 116:  ```  But there is no guarantee that the vested amount of the new `vestingDistributor` is greater than the previously saved amount after changing the distributor.  Furthermore, there is no option to change `previouslyVested` beside this declareReward() function and it will keep reverting unless the admin change back the distributor.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think it would resolve the above problem if we change the previous amounts as well while updating the distributor.  ```solidity   function setVestingDistributor(address _vestingDistributor, uint _previouslyVested, uint _previouslyVestedTimestamp)     external     onlyRoleMalt(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin privs")   {     require(_vestingDistributor != address(0), "SetVestDist: No addr(0)");     vestingDistributor = IVestingDistributor(_vestingDistributor);      previouslyVested = _previouslyVested;     previouslyVestedTimestamp = _previouslyVestedTimestamp;   } ```
