# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  Transactions will not be reverted on failed transfer call, setting system state as if it was successful. This will lead to wrong state accounting down the road with a wide spectrum of possible consequences.  ## Proof of Concept  _safeJoeTransfer do not check for JOE.transfer call success: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L268  _safeJoeTransfer is called by _sendJoeReward, which is used in reward claiming.  JOE token use transfer from OpenZeppelin ERC20: https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/JoeToken.sol#L9  Which does return success code: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L113  Trader Joe also uses checked transfer when dealing with JOE tokens: https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/MasterChefJoeV3.sol#L102   Also, unwrapFor do not check for JLP.transfer call success: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L166   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a require() check for the success of JOE transfer in _safeJoeTransfer function and create and use a similar function with the same check for JLP token transfers
