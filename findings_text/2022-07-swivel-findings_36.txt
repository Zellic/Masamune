We know that if contract A calls contract B which calls contract C, `msg.sender` in contract C is the address of B i.e. the `msg.sender` in VaultTracker is the address of the creator contract. However, the creator contract is not able (and not supposed to) interact with the VaultTracker unlike the marketplace contract.  ## Tools used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Modify the constructor of the VaultTracker contract so that the creator contract can pass in msg.sender (MarketPlace’s address) to be used as admin.
