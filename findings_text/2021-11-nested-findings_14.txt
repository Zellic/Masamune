# Handle  0xngndev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Running a quick contract size check in the NestedFactory contract, I noticed it sat at 27590 bytes, exceeding the allowed 24576 bytes to deploy on mainnet. I removed the require messages alone in that contract and found the contract size dropped to 23172 bytes. Considering you are using large require messages in all the codebase, I would suggest considering a change of approach as to how you expose the error messages. I'll add my suggestions below.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Two ways: 1) Shorten the length of the string messages to just the error instead of including the contract and the function. UniswapV3 repo may be a good example of how to do this. You can always explain errors further in the natspec, or in your documentation (you can make a common errors section). 2) Change require statements for if (...) revert CustomError(). Per solidity docs:  "Using a custom error instance will usually be much cheaper than a string description, because you can use the name of the error to describe it, which is encoded in only four bytes. A longer description can be supplied via NatSpec which does not incur any costs."
