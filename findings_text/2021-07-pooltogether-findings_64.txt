# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `SwappableYieldSource.swapYieldSource` function receives a `_newYieldSource` as a parameter and reads a `_currentYieldSource` from storage. A single storage read should therefore be enough for the entire function and sub-calls.  However, the `_transferFunds` function reads the new yield source from storage again, performing a second storage read. This can be optimized by `_transferFunds` taking an `oldYieldSource` and `newYieldSource` as parameters instead.
