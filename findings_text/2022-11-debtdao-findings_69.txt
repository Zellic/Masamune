However this check reverts when count == 0 or `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0` . Within the contract, any lender can add credit which adds an entry in credits array, credits[ids].   Assume, when borrower chooses lender positions including credits[ids[0]] to draw on, and repays back the loan fully for credits[ids[1]], then the call to declareInsolvent() by the arbiter would revert since it does not pass the `whileBorrowing()` modifier check due to the ids array index shift in the call to  stepQ(), which would shift ids[1] to ids[0], thereby making the condition for `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0` be true causing the revert.    ## Proof of Concept 1. LineOfCredit contract is set up and 5 lenders have deposited into the contract. 2. Alice, the borrower borrows credit from these 5 credit positions including by calling LineOfCredit.borrow() for the position ids. 3. Later Alice pays back the loan for  credit position id 1 just before the contract gets liquidated 4. At the point where ids.stepQ() is called in _repay(), position 1 is moved to ids[0] 4. When contract status is LIQUIDATABLE, no loan drawn on credit position 0 and arbiter calls declareInsolvent() , the call would revert since `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0`  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The modifier whileBorrowing() would need to be reviewed and amended.
