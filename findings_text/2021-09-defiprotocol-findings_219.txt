# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  A basket creator can specify a custom token that allows them to re-enter in `Factory.createBasket`.  ## Impact As new auction and basket contracts are created every time, no cross-basket issues arise. However, note that the official `BasketCreated` event is emitted for all of them, but only the last basket is stored for the `idNumber`. This could lead to issues for some backend / frontend scripts that use the `BasketCreated` event.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Set `_proposals[idNumber].basket = address(newBasket);` immediately after the `newBasket` contract clone has been created to avoid the re-entrancy.
