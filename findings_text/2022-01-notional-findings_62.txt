# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Extra boilerplate code (including the whole of the _afterTokenTransfer function)  ## Proof of Concept  sNOTE inherits from both ERC20Upgradeable and ERC20VotesUpgradeable.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L15  This causes us to have to add explicit helpers for how to handle the inheritance tree to a bunch of functions  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L315  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L328  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L362  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L381  If we look at OZ however, we can see that ERC20VotesUpgradeable inherits from ERC20PermitUpgradeable which in turn inherits from ERC20Upgradeable   https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/fd165faaf00587377b5ab93be3cafb4ffdc96976/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20VotesUpgradeable.sol#L28  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/fd165faaf00587377b5ab93be3cafb4ffdc96976/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-ERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol#L23  There's then no real reason for sNOTE to inherit from ERC20Upgradeable directly. Removing this inheritance should allow you to remove a bunch of the explicit overrides you have.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove direct inheritance of ERC20Upgradeable and remove all the `override(ERC20Upgradeable, ERC20VotesUpgradeable)` stuff. You should be able to just delete `_afterTokenTransfer` in its entirety.
