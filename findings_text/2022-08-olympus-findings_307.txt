# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L104-L119   # Vulnerability details  ### TRSRY.sol alows only loan owner to repay loan  It should be allowed that that everyone can repay the loan. There could be a situation that loan owner is not able to repay the loan but a different address could repay in his place. It seems as unnecessary restriction that only the owner can repay his loan.  **Recommendation**: Allow everyone to repay any loan.
