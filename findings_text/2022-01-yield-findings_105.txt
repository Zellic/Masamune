# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  For the arithmetic operations that will never over/underflow, using the unchecked directive (Solidity v0.8 has default overflow/underflow checks) can save some gas from the unnecessary internal over/underflow checks.  For example:  1. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L114-L114  ```solidity uint256 startIndex = rewardsLength - 1; ```  `rewardsLength - 1` will never underflow.  2. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexYieldWrapper.sol#L82-L85  ```solidity=82 bool isLast = i == vaultsLength - 1; if (!isLast) {     vaults_[i] = vaults_[vaultsLength - 1]; } ```
