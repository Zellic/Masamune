Once deposited, the user is entitled to Concur rewards in proportion to their staked balance and the underlying pool's `allocPoint` in the `MasterChef.sol` contract.  The `Shelter.sol` mechanism allows the owner of the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` to react to emergency events and protect depositor's assets. The staking tokens can be withdrawn after the grace period has passed. However, these staking tokens can be deposited into the `StakingRewards.sol` contract to continue receiving Concur rewards not only for `StakingRewards.sol` but also for their `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` deposited balance which has not been wiped. As a result, users are able to effectively claim double the amount of Concur rewards they should be receiving.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/MasterChef.sol  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/StakingRewards.sol  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure that staking tokens cannot be deposited in both the `StakingRewards.sol` and `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contracts. If this is intended behaviour, it may be worthwhile to ensure that the sheltered users have their deposited balance wiped from the `MasterChef.sol` contract upon being sheltered.
