Specifically, the SLOAD instruction, will go from costing 200 gas to 800 gas.  if any smart contract has a functionality of register ens and it has fallback function which is making some state change in contract on ether receive, it could use more than 2300 gas and revert every transaction  for reference checkout this, https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/security-considerations.html?highlight=transfer#sending-and-receiving-ether https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  use `.call` insted `.transfer`       (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");      require(success, "Transfer failed.");
