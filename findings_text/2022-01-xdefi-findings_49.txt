# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   Waste of gas due to unnecessary underflow checks  ## Proof of Concept   On `XDEFIDistribution.sol:120` and `XDEFIDistribution.sol:175`, you can find the following substraction: `uint256 withdrawAmount = amountUnlocked_ - lockAmount_;`  However, as the Solidity version is 0.8.10, default overflow and underflow checks are made, which cost some gas.  You can save this gas with the `unchecked` keyword to bypass these checks as 5 lines above (L115 and L170), a `require` statement already checks that `lockAmount_ <= amountUnlocked_`.   Therefore, no underflow is possible.  ## Tools Used   VS Code      ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Use the "unchecked" keyword
