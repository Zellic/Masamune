Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.  Refer to the bottom part of this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable  ## Proof of Concept  As an example, the `ExpiringMarket` contract inherits `SimpleMarket`, and the `SimpleMarket` contract does not contain any storage gap. If in a future upgrade, an additional variable is added to the `SimpleMarket` contract, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the `stopped` variable in the `ExpiringMarket` contract, causing unintended consequences.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/8c312a63a91193c6a192a9aab44ff980fbfd7741/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L448-L449  Similarly, the `ExpiringMarket` does not contain any storage gap either, and the `RubiconMarket` contract inherits `ExpiringMarket`. If a new variable is added to the `ExpiringMarket` contract in an upgrade, that variable will overwrite the `buyEnabled` variable in `ExpiringMarket` contract.   ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.  ```solidity uint256[50] private __gap; ```
