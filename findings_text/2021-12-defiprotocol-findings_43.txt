# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The fee calculation on L141 is wrong. It should only get divided by BASE and not (BASE - feePct)  ## Proof of Concept This shows dividing only by BASE is correct: Assumptions:  - BASE is 1e18 accordign to the code - timeDiff is exactly ONE_YEAR (for easier calculations) - startSupply is 1e18 (exactly one basket token, also represents 100% in fee terms) - licenseFee is 1e15 (0.1%) If we calculate the fee of one whole year and startSupply is one token (1e18, equal to 100%), the fee should be exactly the licenseFee  (1e15, 0.1%),  uint256 timeDiff = ONE_YEAR;  uint256 feePct = timeDiff * licenseFee / ONE_YEAR; => therefore we have: feePct = licenseFee which is 1e15 (0.1%) according to our assumptions uint256 fee = startSupply * feePct / BASE; // only divide by BASE => insert values => fee = 1e18 * licenseFee  / 1e18 = licenseFee    This shows the math is wrong:  Assumptions:  - BASE is 1e18 according to the code - timeDiff is exactly ONE_YEAR (for easier calculations) - startSupply is 1e18 (exactly one basket token, also represents 100% in fee terms) - licenseFee is 1e15 (0.1%) If we calculate the fee of one whole year and startSupply is one token (1e18, equal to 100%), the fee should be exactly the licenseFee  (1e15, 0.1%), but the fee is bigger than that.   uint256 timeDiff = ONE_YEAR;  uint256 feePct = timeDiff * licenseFee / ONE_YEAR; => therefore we have: feePct = licenseFee which is 1e15 (0.1%) according to our assumptions  uint256 fee = startSupply * feePct / (BASE - feePct); insert the values => fee = 1e18 * 1e15 / (1e18 - 1e15) => (factor out 1e15) => fee = 1e15 * 1e18 / (1e15 * ( 1e3 - 1) => (cancel 1e15) => 1e18 / ( 1e3 - 1)  math: if we increase the divisor but the dividend stays the same we get a smaller number e.g. (1 / (2-1)) is bigger than (1 / 2) apply this here => 1e18 / ( 1e3 - 1) > 1e18 / 1e3 => 1e18 / ( 1e3 - 1) > 1e15  this shows that the fee is higher than 1e15   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-defiprotocol/blob/205d3766044171e325df6a8bf2e79b37856eece1/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L133 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-defiprotocol/blob/205d3766044171e325df6a8bf2e79b37856eece1/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L141  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - only divide by BASE
