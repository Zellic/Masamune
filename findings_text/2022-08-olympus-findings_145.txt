### [G-01] ++i costs less gas compared to i++  ++i costs **about 5 gas less per iteration** compared to i++ for unsigned integer.  Same thing for decremental with -- operator. This statement is true even with the optimizer enabled. Summarized my results where i is used in a loop, is unsigned integer, and you safely can be changed to ++i without changing any behavior,  ** Most places are using best practice (++i and unchecked where possible) - good job Yet I've found 5 locations that can do better:  ``` src/policies/Operator.sol:   487              price_ = price_ / 10;   488:             decimals++;   489          }    669                  _status.low.observations[regen.nextObservation] = true;   670:                 _status.low.count++;   671              }    674                  _status.low.observations[regen.nextObservation] = false;   675:                 _status.low.count--;   676              }    685                  _status.high.observations[regen.nextObservation] = true;   686:                 _status.high.count++;   687              }      690                  _status.high.observations[regen.nextObservation] = false;   691:                 _status.high.count--;   692              }    ```  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   ### [G-02] An arrays length should be cached to save gas in for-loops  An array’s length should be cached to save gas in for-loops Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset). Caching the array length in the stack saves around **3 gas per iteration**.  I've found only 1 location to improve:  ``` src/policies/Governance.sol:   277     278:         for (uint256 step; step < instructions.length; ) {   279              kernel.executeAction(instructions[step].action, instructions[step].target);    ```  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   ### [G-03] Using default values is cheaper than assignment  If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value 0 for uint, and false for boolean. Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas. For example: ```uint8 i = 0;``` should be replaced with ```uint8 i;```  I've found 3 locations in 2 files:  ``` src/Kernel.sol:   396          uint256 reqLength = requests_.length;   397:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < reqLength; ) {   398              Permissions memory request = requests_[i];  src/utils/KernelUtils.sol:   42     43:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; ) {   44          bytes1 char = unwrapped[i];    57     58:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < 32; ) {   59          bytes1 char = unwrapped[i];   ```  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   ### [G-04] != 0 is cheaper than > 0  != 0 costs less gas compared to > 0 for unsigned integers even when optimizer enabled All of the following findings are uint (E&OE) so >0 and != have exactly the same effect. ** saves 6 gas ** each  I've found only 1 place to improve - good job on all other uses of !=  ``` src/policies/Governance.sol:   246     247:         if (userVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId][msg.sender] > 0) {   248              revert UserAlreadyVoted(); ```  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   ### [G-05] Upgrade pragma to 0.8.16 to save gas  Across the whole solution, the declared pragma is 0.8.15 (good!) Upgrading to 0.8.16 may result in lower gas uses.  Source: ``` According to the release note of 0.8.16: https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement/ ".. there are several minor bug fixes and improvements like more gas-efficient overflow checks for addition and subtraction." ```   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   * Custom errors save gas - already using custom errors all over the project - good job!! * Using immutables (for vars that are only in constructor) seems find throughout the project
