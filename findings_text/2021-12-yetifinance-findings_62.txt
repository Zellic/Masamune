# Handle  jayjonah8   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are no events emitted in the WJLP.sol file for important function calls.  The contract should make use of events for important functions like claimReward() so the protocol can track important events after deployment.  This can help spot unusual activity and assist in monitoring the protocol while its live.    ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L215  ## Tools Used Manual code review
