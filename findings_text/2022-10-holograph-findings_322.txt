The problem lies within the fact that if `msg.sender` is not already an operator at the time of executing the job, he cannot become one after, to retrieve the reward he got for slashing the primary operator. This is because the function `HolographOperator.bondUtilityToken` requires `_bondedAmounts` to be 0 prior to bonding and hence becoming an operator:  ```js require(_bondedOperators[operator] == 0 && _bondedAmounts[operator] == 0, "HOLOGRAPH: operator is bonded"); ```  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Assuming that it is intentional that non-operators can execute jobs (which could make sense, so that a user could finish a bridging process on his own, if none of the operators are doing it): remove the requirement that `_bondedAmounts` need to be 0 prior to bonding and becoming an operator so that non-operators can get access to the slashing reward by unbonding after.  Alternatively (possibly preferrable), just add a method to withdraw any `_bondedAmounts` of non-operators.
