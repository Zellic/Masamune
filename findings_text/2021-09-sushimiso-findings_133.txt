# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function parameters  In some cases, having function arguments in `calldata` instead of `memory` is more optimal.  Consider the following generic example:  ``` solidity contract C {     function add(uint[] memory arr) external returns (uint sum) {         uint length = arr.length;         for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {             sum += arr[i];         }     } } ```  In the above example, the dynamic array `arr` has the storage location `memory`. When the function gets called externally, the array values are kept in `calldata` and copied to `memory` during ABI decoding (using the opcode `calldataload` and `mstore`). And during the for loop, `arr[i]` accesses the value in memory using a `mload`. However, for the above example this is inefficient. Consider the following snippet instead:  ``` solidity contract C {     function add(uint[] calldata arr) external returns (uint sum) {         uint length = arr.length;         for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {             sum += arr[i];         }     } } ```  In the above snippet, instead of going via memory, the value is directly read from `calldata` using `calldataload`. That is, there are no intermediate memory operations that carries this value.  **Gas savings**: In the former example, the ABI decoding begins with copying value from `calldata` to `memory` in a for loop. Each iteration would cost at least 60 gas. In the latter example, this can be completely avoided. This will also reduce the number of instructions and therefore reduces the deploy time cost of the contract.  *In short*, use `calldata` instead of `memory` if the function argument is only read.  Note that in older Solidity versions, changing some function arguments from `memory` to `calldata` may cause "unimplemented feature error". This can be avoided by using a newer (`0.8.*`) Solidity compiler.  ### (non-exhaustive) List of Examples  1.  <https://github.com/sushiswap/miso/blob/2cdb1486a55ded55c81898b7be8811cb68cfda9e/contracts/Access/PointList.sol#L64> 2.  <https://github.com/sushiswap/miso/blob/2cdb1486a55ded55c81898b7be8811cb68cfda9e/contracts/Access/ListFactory.sol#L151> 3.  <https://github.com/sushiswap/miso/blob/2cdb1486a55ded55c81898b7be8811cb68cfda9e/contracts/Access/ListFactory.sol#L152> 4.  <https://github.com/sushiswap/miso/blob/2cdb1486a55ded55c81898b7be8811cb68cfda9e/contracts/Access/PointList.sol#L64>
