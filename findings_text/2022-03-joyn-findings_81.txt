Contract CoreCollection.sol      function withdraw()  2. Contract ERC721Payable.sol    function _handlePayment   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a require statement as being used in the RoyaltyVault.sol ``` require( payableToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,recipient,_amount) == true,             "Failed to transfer amount to recipient" ); ```
