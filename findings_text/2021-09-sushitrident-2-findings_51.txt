# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn` function sends out `amount0`/`amount1` tokens but only updates the reserves by decreasing it by the **fees of these amounts**.  ```solidity unchecked {     // @audit decreases by fees only, not by amount0/amount1     reserve0 -= uint128(amount0fees);     reserve1 -= uint128(amount1fees); } ```  This leads to the pool having wrong reserves after any `burn` action. The pool's balance will be much lower than the reserve variables.  ## Impact As the pool's actual balance will be much lower than the reserve variables, `mint`ing and `swap`ing will not work correctly either. This is because of the `amount0Actual + reserve0 <= _balance(token0)` check in `mint` using a much higher `reserve0` amount than the actual balance (already including the transferred assets from the user). An LP provider will have to make up for the missing reserve decrease from `burn` and pay more tokens.  The same holds true for `swap` which performs the same check in `_updateReserves`.  The pool essentially becomes unusable after a `burn` as LPs / traders need to pay more tokens.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The reserve should be decreased by what is transferred out. In `burn`'s case this is `amount0` / `amount1`.
