# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function withdrawBorrowETH invokes _wethWithdrawTo and later _checkMinReserve, however, the check of reserve is not necessary here, as function _wethWithdrawTo also does that after transferring the ether. However, this reserve check might be bypassed as TransferHelper._wethWithdrawTo uses a low level call that is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. As this MIN_RESERVE sounds like an important value, you should consider preventing re-entrancy attacks here.   // Prevents division by zero and other undesirable behavior   uint public constant MIN_RESERVE = 1000;  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider using re-entrancy guard on all main action functions (e.g. deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, etc): https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol
