# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/pool/DelegatorPool.sol#L70-L78  ```solidity         // Calculate stake owed to delegator         uint256 currTotalStake = pendingStake();         uint256 owedStake = (currTotalStake * _stake) /             (initialStake - claimedInitialStake);          // Calculate fees owed to delegator         uint256 currTotalFees = pendingFees();         uint256 owedFees = (currTotalFees * _stake) /             (initialStake - claimedInitialStake); ```  The local variable `currTotalStake`, `currTotalFees` is used only once. Making the expression inline can save gas.  Similar issue exists in `L2Migrator.sol#claimStake()`, `L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()`, `L1Migrator.sol#migrateLPT()`, `L1ArbitrumMessenger.sol#onlyL2Counterpart()`.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity         // Calculate stake owed to delegator         uint256 owedStake = (pendingStake() * _stake) /             (initialStake - claimedInitialStake);          // Calculate fees owed to delegator         uint256 owedFees = (pendingFees() * _stake) /             (initialStake - claimedInitialStake); ```
