# Lines of code  https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L29   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It's not possible to initialize the accountant because of a mistake in the function's require statement.  I rate it as MED since a key part of the protocol wouldn't be available until the contract is modified and redeployed.  ## Proof of Concept The issue is the following `require()` statement: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L29  There, the function checks whether the accountant has received the correct amount of tokens. But, it compares the accountant's balance with the `_initialSupply`. That value is always 0. So the require statement will always fail  When the Note contract is initialized, `_initialSupply` is set to 0:  - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/deploy/canto/004_deploy_Note.ts#L14 - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Note.sol#L9 - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol#L32  After `_mint_to_Accountant()` mints `type(uint).max` tokens to the accountant: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Note.sol#L18 That increases the `totalSupply` but not the `_initialSupply`: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol#L242  The `_initialSupply` value is only modified by the ERC20 contract's constructor.  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the require statement to ```sol require(note.balanceOf(msg.sender) == note.totalSupply(), "AccountantDelegate::initiatlize: Accountant has not received payment"); ```
