# [QA-1] Naming inconsistency - some arguments have ``_`` at their prefixes but others do not at NestedFactory.sol  Throughout the file ``NestedFactory.sol``, arguments of functions have ``_`` at their prefixes like ``function setFeeSplitter(FeeSplitter _feeSplitter)``. However, following 2 arguments do not have ``_`` at their prefixes which are not consistent.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L121  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L133  ---  # [QA-2] Use either ``_msgSender()`` or ``msg.sender``   Throughout the file ``NestedFactory.sol``, ``_msgSender()`` is used to get the sender. However, following 2 places use ``msg.sender`` which seem not consistent.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L89  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L177
