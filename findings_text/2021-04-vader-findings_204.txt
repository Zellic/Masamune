# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The spec defines the number of LP units to be minted as `units = (P (a B + A b))/(2 A B) * slipAdjustment = P * (part1 + part2) / part3 * slipAdjustments` but the `Utils.calcLiquidityUnits` function computes `((P * part1) + part2) / part3 * slipAdjustments`. The associativity on `P * part1` is wrong, and `part2` is not multiplied by `P`.  ## Impact  The math from the spec is not correclty implemented and could lead to the protocol being economically exploited, as redeeming the minted LP tokens does not result in the initial tokens anymore.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix the equation.
