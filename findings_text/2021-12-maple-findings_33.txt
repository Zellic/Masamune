# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  It's possible to overwrite the `_versionOf[implementationAddress_]` field through the `proxy-factory-1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/ProxyFactory._registerImplementation` function and register the implementation as several distinct versions.  ```solidity function _registerImplementation(uint256 version_, address implementationAddress_) internal virtual returns (bool success_) {     // Cannot already be registered and cannot be empty implementation.     if (_implementationOf[version_] != address(0) || !_isContract(implementationAddress_)) return false;     _versionOf[implementationAddress_] = version_;     _implementationOf[version_]        = implementationAddress_;      return true; } ```  #### POC - call `_registerImplementation(1, impl)` - call `_registerImplementation(2, impl)`. This does not check that the versions has not already been registered by checking `_versionOf[impl] == 0`. Then the old `_versionOf[impl] = 1` is overwritten with `2`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check if being able to set a new version for the same contract is desired. If not, add a `_versionOf[impl] == 0` check.
