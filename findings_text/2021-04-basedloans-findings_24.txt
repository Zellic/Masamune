# Handle  paulius.eth   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact functions getTokenConfigBySymbolHash, getTokenConfigByCToken and getTokenConfigByUnderlying check returned index against max uint:   index != uint(-1) -1 should indicate that the index is not found, however, a default value for an uninitialized uint is 0, so it is impossible to get -1. What is even weirder is that 0 will be returned for non-existing configs but 0 is a valid index for the 1st config.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps One of the solutions would be to reserve 0 for a not found index and use it when searching in mappings. Then normal indexes should start from 1. Another solution would be to introduce a new mapping with a boolean value that indicates if this index is initialized or not but this may be a more gas costly way.
