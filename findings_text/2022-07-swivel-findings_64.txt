# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/main/Marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L148   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Due to missing modifier, User will be able to redeem zcTokens and withdraw underlying even in paused Market. This happens due to missing unpaused(p) modifier  ## Proof of Concept 1. Lets see function definition for authRedeem function  ``` function authRedeem(uint8 p, address u, uint256 m, address f, address t, uint256 a) public authorized(markets[p][u][m].zcToken) returns (uint256 underlyingAmount) ```  2. Observe that unpaused(p) modifier is missing  3. This means if Marketplace is placed under paused state by Admin, then also User can call authRedeem at Marketplace via withdraw/redeem at ZcToken contract.   4. This will allow Users to withdraw in paused state which is incorrect  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add unpaused(p) modifier in authRedeem function  ``` function authRedeem(uint8 p, address u, uint256 m, address f, address t, uint256 a) public authorized(markets[p][u][m].zcToken) unpaused(p) returns (uint256 underlyingAmount) { ... } ```
