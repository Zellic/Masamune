# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  `setLockTemplate` is initializing the new template using hardcoded values. This means that if a new lock version is set which has different/additional `initialize` parameters, Unlock protocol would have to be updated in order to initialize it.  ## Impact Less convenient adding of new locks as Unlock would have to be upgraded if their initialize function has changed.  ## Proof of Concept `setLockTemplate` uses the following code to initialize the template: ```     IPublicLock(_publicLockAddress).initialize(       address(this), 0, address(0), 0, 0, ''     ); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/Unlock.sol#L430:#L432 Which is hardcoded. This is unlike `createLock` for example, where the initialize call is being received as parameter, to allow different future versions. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/Unlock.sol#L219   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change `setLockTemplate` so the initializing parameters would be received as parameter.
