# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  More keys can be minted than maxNumberOfKeys since `shareKey` and `grantKey` do not check if the lock is sold out.  ## Impact More keys can be minted than intended.  ## Proof of Concept In both `shareKey` and `grantKey`, if minting a new token, a new token is simply minted (and `_totalSupply` increased) without checking it against `maxNumberOfKeys`. This is unlike `purchase`, which has the `notSoldOut` modifier. `grantKey`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinGrantKeys.sol#L41:#L42 `shareKey`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinTransfer.sol#L83:#L84 Both functions call `_assignNewTokenId` which does not check maxNumberOfKeys.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinKeys.sol#L311:#L322 So you can say that `_assignNewTokenId` is actually the root of the error, and this is why I am submitting this as 1 finding and not 2 (for grantKey/shareKey).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check to `_assignNewTokenId` that will revert if we need to record a new key and `maxNumberOfKeys` has been reached.
