The delegation should be removed at the lines:  ```solidity         Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];         removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId); ``` but the array `checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds` is the list of **delegators** to `tokenId` **itself**. So, unless the delegation was from the token to itself, `removeDelegation` does nothing.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Two fixes are proposed:  1. Add the delegatee as an argument to `removeDelegation` and remove `tokenId` from its list of delegators:     ```diff -   function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId) external { +   function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId, uint256 toTokenId) external {         require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');         uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[tokenId]; -       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1]; +       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];         removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId);         _writeCheckpoint(tokenId, nCheckpoints, checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds);     } ```  or  2. Load the delegatee from the mapping `delegates` which maps each delegator to its current delegatee:  ```diff     function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId) external {         require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed'); +       uint256 toTokenId = delegates[tokenId];         uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[tokenId]; -       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1]; +       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];         removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId);         _writeCheckpoint(tokenId, nCheckpoints, checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds);     } ```
