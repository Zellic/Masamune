# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `CTokenMultiOracle` contract assumes the exchange rates (borrowing rate) of Compound always have 18 decimals, while, however, which is not true. According to the [Compound documentation](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens#exchange-rate), the exchange rate returned from the `exchangeRateCurrent` function is scaled by `1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals)` (and so does `exchangeRateStored`). Using a wrong decimal number on the exchange rate could cause incorrect pricing on tokens.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [CTokenMultiOracle.sol#L110](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/oracles/compound/CTokenMultiOracle.sol#L110)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Follow the documentation and get the decimals of the underlying tokens to set the correct decimal of a `Source`.
