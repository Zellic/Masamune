In its fallback function, it calls the actual implementation in order to handle additional logic.   If Holographer is called with no calldata and some msg.value, the call will reach the  receive() function, which does not forward the call down to the implementation.  This can be a serious value leak issue, because the underlying implementation may have valid behavior for handling sending of value. For example, it can mint the next available tokenID and credit it to the user. Since this logic is never reached, the entire msg.value is just leaked.  ## Impact  Leak of value when interacting with an NFT using the receive() or fallback() callback. Note that if NFT implements fallback OR receive() function, execution will never reach either of them from the enforcer's receive() function.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Funnel receive() empty calls down to the implementation.
