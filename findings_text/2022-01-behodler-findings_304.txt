# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The LP pricing formula used in the `burnAsset` function of `LimboDAO` is vulnerable to flashloan manipulation. By swapping a large number of EYE into the underlying pool, an attacker can intentionally inflate the value of the LP tokens to get more `fate` than he is supposed to with a relatively low cost.  With the large portion of `fate` he gets, he has more voting power to influence the system's decisions, or even he can convert his `fate` to Flan tokens for a direct profit.  ## Proof of Concept  Below is an example of how the attack works:  1. Suppose that there are 1000 EYE and 1000 LINK tokens in the UniswapV2 LINK-EYE pool. The pool's total supply is 1000, and the attacker has 100 LP tokens. 2. If the attacker burns his LP tokens, he earns `1000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 2000` amount of `fate`. 3. Instead, the attacker swaps in 1000 EYE and gets 500 LINK from the pool (according to `x * y = k`, ignoring fees for simplicity). Now the pool contains 2000 EYE and 500 LINK tokens. 4. After the manipulation, he burns his LP tokens and gets `2000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 4000` amount of `fate`. 5. Lastly, he swaps 500 LINK into the pool to get back his 1000 EYE. 6. Compared to Step 2, the attacker earns a double amount of `fate` by only paying the swapping fees to the pool. The more EYE tokens he swaps into the pool, the more `fate` he can get. This attack is practically possible by leveraging flashloans or flashswaps from other pools containing EYE tokens.  The `setEYEBasedAssetStake` function has the same issue of using a manipulatable LP pricing formula.
