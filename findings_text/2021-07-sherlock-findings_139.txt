# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  The `getInitialUnstakeEntry` function of `PoolBase` returns the first active unstaking entry of a staker, which requires the current block to be strictly before the last block in the unstaking window. However, the `unstake` function allows the current block to be exactly the same as the last block (same logic in `unstakeWindowExpiry`).  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [PoolBase.sol#L136](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/PoolBase.sol#L136) [PoolBase.sol#L344](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/PoolBase.sol#L344) [PoolBase.sol#L364](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/PoolBase.sol#L364)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change the `<=` comparison at line 136 to `<` for consistency.
