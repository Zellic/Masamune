However, there are several cases this modifier could be bypassed, which breaks the intended admin control function and special mode.   ## Proof of Concept  ### `stake()`  In paused mode, no more `stakeGGP()` is allowed,  ```solidity File: contract/Staking.sol 319:  function stakeGGP(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused { 320:   // Transfer GGP tokens from staker to this contract 321:   ggp.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); 322:   _stakeGGP(msg.sender, amount); 323:  } ```  However, `restakeGGP()` is still available, which potentially violate the purpose of pause mode. ```solidity File: contract/Staking.sol 328:  function restakeGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 amount) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("ClaimNodeOp", msg.sender) { 329:   // Transfer GGP tokens from the ClaimNodeOp contract to this contract 330:   ggp.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); 331:   _stakeGGP(stakerAddr, amount); 332:  } ```  ### `withdraw()`  In paused mode, no more `withdrawGGP()` is allowed,  ```solidity File: contract/Staking.sol 358:  function withdrawGGP(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {  373:   vault.withdrawToken(msg.sender, ggp, amount); ```  However, `claimAndRestake()` is still available, which can withdraw from the vault. ```solidity File: contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol 089:  function claimAndRestake(uint256 claimAmt) external {  103:   if (restakeAmt > 0) { 104:    vault.withdrawToken(address(this), ggp, restakeAmt); 105:    ggp.approve(address(staking), restakeAmt); 106:    staking.restakeGGP(msg.sender, restakeAmt); 107:   } 108:  109:   if (claimAmt > 0) { 110:    vault.withdrawToken(msg.sender, ggp, claimAmt); 111:   } ```  THe function `spend()` can also ignore the pause mode to withdraw from the vault. But this is a guardian function. It could be intended behavior. ```solidity File: contract/ClaimProtocolDAO.sol 20:  function spend( 21:   string memory invoiceID, 22:   address recipientAddress, 23:   uint256 amount 24:  ) external onlyGuardian {  32:   vault.withdrawToken(recipientAddress, ggpToken, amount); ```    ## Tools Used Manual analysis.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  - add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to `restakeGGP()` and `claimAndRestake()` - maybe also for guardian function `spend()`.
