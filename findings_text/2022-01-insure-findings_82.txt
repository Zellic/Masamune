# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact > The operators “||” and “&&” apply the common short-circuiting rules. This means that in the expression “f(x) || g(y)”, if “f(x)” evaluates to true, “g(y)” will not be evaluated even if it may have side-effects.  Source: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.4/types.html#booleans  ## Proof of Concept In `IndexTemplate.sol:withdrawable()`, there's an if-statement as such: ``` 293:                         if (i == 0 || _availableRate < _lowestAvailableRate) { ``` Here, the condition `i == 0` is always evaluated and is always equal to `false` when `i > 0`, meaning here a total of `poolList.length - 1` evaluations are always evaluated to `false`.  It's best to reorder the conditions such as this condition doesn't get evaluated if `_availableRate < _lowestAvailableRate` is satisfied: ``` 293:                         if (_availableRate < _lowestAvailableRate || i == 0 ) { ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Apply the refacto
