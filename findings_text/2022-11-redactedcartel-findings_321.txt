This is `compound()` function code in `AutoPxGlp` contract: ```     function compound(         uint256 minUsdg,         uint256 minGlp,         bool optOutIncentive     )         public         returns (             uint256 gmxBaseRewardAmountIn,             uint256 pxGmxAmountOut,             uint256 pxGlpAmountOut,             uint256 totalPxGlpFee,             uint256 totalPxGmxFee,             uint256 pxGlpIncentive,             uint256 pxGmxIncentive         )     {         if (minUsdg == 0) revert InvalidParam();         if (minGlp == 0) revert InvalidParam();          uint256 preClaimTotalAssets = asset.balanceOf(address(this));         uint256 preClaimPxGmxAmount = pxGmx.balanceOf(address(this));          PirexRewards(rewardsModule).claim(asset, address(this));         PirexRewards(rewardsModule).claim(pxGmx, address(this));          // Track the amount of rewards received         gmxBaseRewardAmountIn = gmxBaseReward.balanceOf(address(this));          if (gmxBaseRewardAmountIn != 0) {             // Deposit received rewards for pxGLP             (, pxGlpAmountOut, ) = PirexGmx(platform).depositGlp(                 address(gmxBaseReward),                 gmxBaseRewardAmountIn,                 minUsdg,                 minGlp,                 address(this)             );         }          // Distribute fees if the amount of vault assets increased         uint256 newAssets = totalAssets() - preClaimTotalAssets;         if (newAssets != 0) {             totalPxGlpFee = (newAssets * platformFee) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;             pxGlpIncentive = optOutIncentive                 ? 0                 : (totalPxGlpFee * compoundIncentive) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;              if (pxGlpIncentive != 0)                 asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, pxGlpIncentive);              asset.safeTransfer(owner, totalPxGlpFee - pxGlpIncentive);         }          // Track the amount of pxGMX received         pxGmxAmountOut = pxGmx.balanceOf(address(this)) - preClaimPxGmxAmount;          if (pxGmxAmountOut != 0) {             // Calculate and distribute pxGMX fees if the amount of pxGMX increased             totalPxGmxFee = (pxGmxAmountOut * platformFee) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;             pxGmxIncentive = optOutIncentive                 ? 0                 : (totalPxGmxFee * compoundIncentive) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;              if (pxGmxIncentive != 0)                 pxGmx.safeTransfer(msg.sender, pxGmxIncentive);              pxGmx.safeTransfer(owner, totalPxGmxFee - pxGmxIncentive);              // Update the pxGmx reward accrual             _harvest(pxGmxAmountOut - totalPxGmxFee);         } else {             // Required to keep the globalState up-to-date             _globalAccrue();         }          emit Compounded(             msg.sender,             minGlp,             gmxBaseRewardAmountIn,             pxGmxAmountOut,             pxGlpAmountOut,             totalPxGlpFee,             totalPxGmxFee,             pxGlpIncentive,             pxGmxIncentive         );     } ``` As you can see contract collects rewards by calling `PirexRewards.claim()` and in the line `uint256 newAssets = totalAssets() - preClaimTotalAssets;` contract calculates the received amount of rewards(by subtracting the balance after and before reward claim) and then calculates fee based on this amount `totalPxGlpFee = (newAssets * platformFee) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;` and then sends the fee in the line `asset.safeTransfer(owner, totalPxGlpFee - pxGlpIncentive)` for `owner`. the logic for `pxGmx` rewards are the same. As you can see the calculation of fee is based on the rewards received, and there is no other logic in the contract to calculate and transfer the fee of protocol. so if `AutoPxGpl` receives rewards without `compound()` getting called then for those rewards fee won't be calculated and transferred and protocol would lose it's fee. In the line `_harvest(pxGmxAmountOut - totalPxGmxFee)` contract calls `_harvest()` function to update the `pxGmx` reward accrual and there is no call to `_harvest()` in any other place and this is the only place where `pxGmx` reward accrual gets updated. contract uses `pxGmxAmountOut` which is the amount of `gmx` contract received during the call (code calculates it by subtracting the balance after and before reward claim: `pxGmxAmountOut = pxGmx.balanceOf(address(this)) - preClaimPxGmxAmount;`) so contract only handles accrual rewards in this function call and if some `pxGmx` rewards claimed for contract without `compund()` logic execution then those rewards won't be used in `_harvest()` and `_globalAccrue()` calculation and users won't receive those rewards. As mentioned attacker can call `PirexRewards.claim(pxGmx, AutoPxGpl)` directly and make `PirexRewads` contract to transfer `AutoPxGpl` rewards. This is `claim()` code in `PirexRewards`: ```     function claim(ERC20 producerToken, address user) external {         if (address(producerToken) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();         if (user == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();          harvest();         userAccrue(producerToken, user);          ProducerToken storage p = producerTokens[producerToken];         uint256 globalRewards = p.globalState.rewards;         uint256 userRewards = p.userStates[user].rewards;          // Claim should be skipped and not reverted on zero global/user reward         if (globalRewards != 0 && userRewards != 0) {             ERC20[] memory rewardTokens = p.rewardTokens;             uint256 rLen = rewardTokens.length;              // Update global and user reward states to reflect the claim             p.globalState.rewards = globalRewards - userRewards;             p.userStates[user].rewards = 0;              emit Claim(producerToken, user);              // Transfer the proportionate reward token amounts to the recipient             for (uint256 i; i < rLen; ++i) {                 ERC20 rewardToken = rewardTokens[i];                 address rewardRecipient = p.rewardRecipients[user][rewardToken];                 address recipient = rewardRecipient != address(0)                     ? rewardRecipient                     : user;                 uint256 rewardState = p.rewardStates[rewardToken];                 uint256 amount = (rewardState * userRewards) / globalRewards;                  if (amount != 0) {                     // Update reward state (i.e. amount) to reflect reward tokens transferred out                     p.rewardStates[rewardToken] = rewardState - amount;                      producer.claimUserReward(                         address(rewardToken),                         amount,                         recipient                     );                 }             }         }     } ``` As you can see it can be called by anyone for any user. so to perform this attack, attacker would perform this steps: 1. suppose `AutoPxGpl` has pending rewards, for example 100 `pxGmx` and 100 `weth`. 2. attacker would call  `PirexRewards.claim(pxGmx, AutoPxGpl)` and  `PirexRewards.claim(pxGpl, AutoPxGpl)` and `PirexRewards` contract would calculate and claim and transfer `pxGmx` rewards and `weth` rewards of `AutoPxGpl` address. 3. then `AutoPxGpl` has no pending rewards but the balance of `pxGmx` and `weth` of contract has been increased. 4. if anyone call `AutoPxGpl.compound()` because there is no pending rewards contract would receive no rewards and because contract only calculates fee and rewards based on received rewards during the call to `compound()` so contract wouldn't calculate any fee or reward accrual for those 1000 `pxGmx` and `weth` rewards. 5. `owner` of `AutoPxGpl` would lose his fee for those rewards and users of `AutoPxGpl` would lose their claims for those 1000 `pxGmx` rewards (because the calculation for them didn't happen).  This bug is because of the fact that the only logic handling rewards is in `compound()` function which is only handling receiving rewards by calling `claim()` during the call to `compound()` but it's possible to call `claim()` directly (`PirexRewards` contract allows this) and `AutoPxGpl` won't get notified about this new rewards and the related logics won't get executed.  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps contract should keep track of it's previous balance when `compound()` get executed and update this balance in deposits and withdraws and claims so it can detect rewards that directly transferred to contract without call to `compound()`.
