# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  An attacker can front-run any operation that depends on the pool contract's internal balance amounts being unsynced to pool's balance on token/base contracts effectively nullifying the transfer of base/tokens for those operations. This will make _getAddedBaseAmount() and _getAddedTokenAmount() return 0 (because the balances are synced) from such operations.   Impact: The affected operations are: addForMember(), swapTo() and mintSynth() which will all take the user funds to respective contracts but will treat it as 0 (because of the syncing) and thus not add liquidity, return swapped tokens or mint any synths to the affected users. User loses deposited funds to the contract.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L308-L312  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L261-L270  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L272-L281  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L216-L220  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L231  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L174-L175  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L279  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add access control to sync() function so that only Router can call it via addDividend().
