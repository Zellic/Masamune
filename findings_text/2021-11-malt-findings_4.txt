# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Unintended advancement incentives being paid out to third party  ## Proof of Concept  `DAO.sol` incentives outside parties to advance the epoch by minting 100 MALT tokens for calling the `advance` function. This is limited by checking that the start timestamp of the next epoch has passed.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L55-L63  This start timestamp is calculated by multiplying the new epoch number by the length of an epoch and adding it to the genesis timestamp.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L65-L67  This method makes no accommodation for the fact that previous epochs may have been set to be a different length to what they are currently.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L111-L114  In the case where the epoch length is reduced, `DAO` will think that the epoch number can be incremented potentially many times. Provided the `advanceIncentive` is worth more than the gas necessary to advance the epoch will be rapidly advanced potentially many times paying out unnecessary incentives.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Rather than calculating from the genesis timestamp, store the last time that the epoch length was modified and calculate from there.
