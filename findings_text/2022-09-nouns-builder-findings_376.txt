If the first auction in such a protocol is paused and unpaused, the check for `if (auction.tokenId == 0)` will pass and `_createAuction()` will automatically be called, minting the next token and starting a new auction based on token #1.  The result is that `highestBid` and `highestBidder` are reset, the first auction is never settled, and the highest bid (as well as NFT #0) will remain stuck in the platform.  The following test confirms this finding:  ```solidity function test_PauseAndUnpauseInFirstAuction() public {     address bidder1 = vm.addr(0xB1);     address bidder2 = vm.addr(0xB2);      vm.deal(bidder1, 100 ether);     vm.deal(bidder2, 100 ether);      console.log("Deploying with no founder pct...");     deployMockWithEmptyFounders();      console.log("Unpausing...");     vm.prank(founder);     auction.unpause();      console.log("Bidder makes initial bid.");     vm.prank(bidder1);     auction.createBid{ value: 1 ether }(0);     (uint256 tokenId_, uint256 highestBid_, address highestBidder_,,,) = auction.auction();     console.log("Currently bidding for ID ", tokenId_);     console.log("Highest Bid: ", highestBid_, ". Bidder: ", highestBidder_);     console.log("Contract Balance: ", address(auction).balance);     console.log("--------");      console.log("Pausing and unpausing auction house...");     vm.startPrank(address(treasury));     auction.pause();     auction.unpause();     vm.stopPrank();      console.log("Bidder makes new bid.");     vm.prank(bidder2);     auction.createBid{ value: 0.5 ether }(1);     (uint256 tokenId2_, uint256 highestBid2_, address highestBidder2_,,,) = auction.auction();     console.log("Currently bidding for ID ", tokenId2_);     console.log("Highest Bid: ", highestBid2_, ". Bidder: ", highestBidder2_);     console.log("Contract Balance: ", address(auction).balance); ```  ## Tools Used  Manual Review, Foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the block in `unpause()` that transfers ownership and creates an auction if `auction.tokenId == 0` and trigger those actions manually in the deployment flow.
