# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `supplyTokenTo` function of `SwappableYieldSource` assumes that `amount` of `_depositToken` is transferred to itself after calling the `safeTransferFrom` function (and thus it supplies `amount` of token to the yield source). However, this may not be true if the `_depositToken` is a transfer-on-fee token or a deflationary/rebasing token, causing the received amount to be less than the accounted amount.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [SwappableYieldSource.sol#L211-L212](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L211-L212)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Get the actual received amount by calculating the difference of token balance before and after the transfer. For example, re-writing line 211-212 to:  ```solidity uint256 balanceBefore = _depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)); _depositToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); uint256 receivedAmount = _depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore; yieldSource.supplyTokenTo(receivedAmount, address(this)); ```
