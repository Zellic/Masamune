# Handle  heiho1   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  TroveManagerRedemptions does not inherit contracts/Interfaces/ITroveManagerRedemptions.sol but should.  Note that TroveManager.sol does inherit ITroveManager.  Decoupling an interface from its implementation can lead to code drift and incomplete or incorrect interfaces/implementations.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/5f5bf61209b722ba568623d8446111b1ea5cb61c/packages/contracts/contracts/TroveManagerRedemptions.sol#L38  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Declare contract as "TroveManagerRedemptions is TroveManagerBase, ITroveManagerRedemptions"
