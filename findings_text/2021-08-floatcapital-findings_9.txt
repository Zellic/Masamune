# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The functions initializeMarket and _seedMarketInitially use the variable latestMarket. If these functions would be called seperately from createNewSyntheticMarket, then latestMarket would have the same value for each call of initializeMarket and _seedMarketInitially   This would mean that the latestMarket is initialized multiple times and the previous market(s) are not initialized properly. Note: the call to addNewStakingFund could have prevented this issue, but also allows this, see separate issue.  Note: the functions can only be called by the admin, so if createNewSyntheticMarket and initializeMarket are called in combination, then it would not lead to problems, but in future release of the software the calls to createNewSyntheticMarket and initializeMarket might get separated.  ## Proof of Concept //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-floatcapital/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LongShort.sol#L304 function _seedMarketInitially(uint256 initialMarketSeedForEachMarketSide, uint32 marketIndex) internal virtual {    ...     ISyntheticToken(syntheticTokens[latestMarket][true]).mint(PERMANENT_INITIAL_LIQUIDITY_HOLDER,initialMarketSeedForEachMarketSide);   // should be marketIndex     ISyntheticToken(syntheticTokens[latestMarket][false]).mint(PERMANENT_INITIAL_LIQUIDITY_HOLDER,initialMarketSeedForEachMarketSide);  // should be marketIndex    function initializeMarket(      uint32 marketIndex,....)   ...     require(!marketExists[marketIndex], "already initialized");     require(marketIndex <= latestMarket, "index too high");      marketExists[marketIndex] = true; ..     IStaker(staker).addNewStakingFund(       latestMarket,                                       // should be marketIndex       syntheticTokens[latestMarket][true],   // should be marketIndex       syntheticTokens[latestMarket][false],  // should be marketIndex   ...  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace latestMarket with marketIndex in the functions initializeMarket and _seedMarketInitially  p.s. confirmed by Jason of float capital: Definitely an issue, luckily both of those functions are adminOnly. But that is definitely not ideal!
