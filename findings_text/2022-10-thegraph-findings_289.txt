Its implementation is:  ```Solidity modifier onlyL1Counterpart() {         require(             msg.sender == AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(l1Counterpart),             "ONLY_COUNTERPART_GATEWAY"         );         _;     } ```  It uses applyL1ToL2Alias defined as:  ``` uint160 constant offset = uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111);      /// @notice Utility function that converts the address in the L1 that submitted a tx to     /// the inbox to the msg.sender viewed in the L2     /// @param l1Address the address in the L1 that triggered the tx to L2     /// @return l2Address L2 address as viewed in msg.sender     function applyL1ToL2Alias(address l1Address) internal pure returns (address l2Address) {         l2Address = address(uint160(l1Address) + offset);     } ```  This behavior matches with how Arbitrum augments the sender's address to L2. The issue is that I've spoken with the team and they are [planning](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/pull/725) an upgrade from Solidity 0.7.6 to 0.8.0. Their proposed [changes](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/c4d3cb56cb4032dbb3a0f1b7535b5d94ccf86222/contracts/arbitrum/AddressAliasHelper.sol) will break this function, because under 0.8.0, this line has a ~ 1/15 chance to overflow:  `l2Address = address(uint160(l1Address) + offset);`  Interestingly, the sum intentionally wraps around using the uint160 type to return a correct address, but this wrapping will overflow in 0.8.0  ## Impact  There is a ~6.5% chance that finalizeInboundTransfer will not work.  ## Proof of Concept  l1Address is L1GraphTokenGateway, suppose its address is 0xF000000000000000000000000000000000000000.  Then 0xF000000000000000000000000000000000000000 + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111 > UINT160_MAX , meaning overflow.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Wrap the calculation in an unchecked block, which will make it behave correctly.
