# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L151-L151  ```solidity     _pointsPerUnit += ((newXDEFI * _pointsMultiplier) / totalUnitsCached); ```  In the current implementation,  `_pointsPerUnit` can be changed in `updateDistribution()` which can be called by anyone.   A malicious early user can `lock()` with only `1 wei` of XDEFI and makes `_pointsPerUnit` to be very large, causing future users not to be able to `lock()` and/or `unlock()` anymore due to overflow in arithmetic related to `_pointsMultiplier`.  As a result, the contract can be malfunctioning and even freeze users' funds in edge cases.  ### PoC  Given:  - bonusMultiplierOf[30 days] = 100  1. Alice `lock()` `1 wei` of XDEFI for 30 days as the first user of the contract. Got `1` units, and `totalUnits` now is `1`; 2. Alice sends `170141183460469 wei` of `XDEFI` to the contract and calls `updateDistribution()`:  ```solidity     _pointsPerUnit += ((170141183460469 * 2**128) / 1); ```  3. Bob tries to `lock()` `1,100,000 * 1e18` of `XDEFI` for 30 days, the tx will fail, as `_pointsPerUnit * units` overlows; 4. Bob `lock()` `1,000,000 * 1e18` of `XDEFI` for 30 days; 5. The rewarder sends `250,000 * 1e18` of `XDEFI` to the contract and calls `updateDistribution()`:   ```solidity     _pointsPerUnit += ((250_000 * 1e18 * 2**128) / (1_000_000 * 1e18 + 1)); ```  6. 30 days later, Bob tries to call `unlock()`, the tx will fail, as `_pointsPerUnit * units` overflows.    ### Recomandation  Uniswap v2 solved a similar problem by sending the first 1000 lp tokens to the zero address.  The same solution should work here, i.e., on constructor set an initial amount (like 1e8) for `totalUnits`    https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L39-L44  ```solidity constructor (address XDEFI_, string memory baseURI_, uint256 zeroDurationPointBase_) ERC721("Locked XDEFI", "lXDEFI") {         require((XDEFI = XDEFI_) != address(0), "INVALID_TOKEN");         owner = msg.sender;         baseURI = baseURI_;         _zeroDurationPointBase = zeroDurationPointBase_;          totalUnits = 100_000_000;     } ```
