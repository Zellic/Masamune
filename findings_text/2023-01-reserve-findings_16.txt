The `docs/system-design.md` documentation describes the `paused` state as:    >all interactions disabled EXCEPT RToken.redeem + RToken.cancel + ERC20 functions + StRSR.stake  Redemption of rToken should only ever be prohibited when the protocol is in the `frozen` state.    The issue is that the `RToken.redeem` function ([https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/RToken.sol#L439-L514)) relies on the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function ([https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L72-L77](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L72-L77)) to be called before redemption.    Also the only function that relies on `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` to be called before is `RToken.redeem`.    Therefore `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` can be called at any time before a specific ERC20 needs first be transferred from the `BackingManager` for the purpose of redemption of rToken.    The issue is that the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function has the `notPausedOrFrozen` modifier. This means it cannot (in contrast to `RToken.redeem`) be called when the protocol is `paused`.    Therefore if rToken is for the first time redeemed for a specific ERC20 in a `paused` protocol state, `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` might not have been called before.    This effectively disables redemption of rToken as long as the protocol is `paused` and is clearly against the usability / economic considerations to allow redemption in the `paused` state.    ## Proof of Concept For simplicity assume there is an rToken backed by a single ERC20 called AToken  1. rToken is issued and AToken is transferred to the `BackingManager`. 2. The protocol goes into the `paused` state before any redemptions have occurred. So the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function might not have been called at this point. 3. Now the protocol is `paused` which should allow redemption of rToken but it is not possible because the AToken allowance cannot be granted since the `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function cannot be called in the `paused` state.  Another scenario is when the basket of a RToken is changed to include an ERC20 that was not included in the basket before. If the protocol now goes into the `paused` state without `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` being called before, redemption is not possible.    ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `BackingManager.grantRTokenAllowance` function should use the `notFrozen` modifier instead of the `notPausedOrFrozen` modifier such that allowance can be granted in the `paused` state:    ``` diff --git a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol index 431e0796..7dfa29e9 100644 --- a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol +++ b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol @@ -69,7 +69,7 @@ contract BackingManagerP1 is TradingP1, IBackingManager {      // checks: erc20 in assetRegistry      // action: set allowance on erc20 for rToken to UINT_MAX      // Using two safeApprove calls instead of safeIncreaseAllowance to support USDT -    function grantRTokenAllowance(IERC20 erc20) external notPausedOrFrozen { +    function grantRTokenAllowance(IERC20 erc20) external notFrozen {          require(assetRegistry.isRegistered(erc20), "erc20 unregistered");          // == Interaction ==          IERC20Upgradeable(address(erc20)).safeApprove(address(main.rToken()), 0); ```
