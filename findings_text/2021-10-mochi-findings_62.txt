# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  # regerralFeePool is vulnerable to MEV searcher  ## Impact `claimRewardAsMochi` in the `ReferralFeePoolV0` ignores slippage. This is not a desirable design. There are a lot of MEV searchers in the current network. Swapping assets with no slippage control would get rekted. Please refer to https://github.com/flashbots/pm.  Given the current state of the Ethereum network. Users would likely be sandwiched. I consider this is a high-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept [ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#L28-L48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/feePool/ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#L28-L48)  Please refer to https://medium.com/immunefi/mushrooms-finance-theft-of-yield-bug-fix-postmortem-16bd6961388f  to see a possible attack pattern.   ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I recommend adding minReceivedAmount as a parameter.  ```solidity function claimRewardAsMochi(uint256 _minReceivedAmount) external {     // original logic here     require(engine.mochi().balanceOf(address(this)) > _minReceivedAmount, "!min");     engine.mochi().transfer(         msg.sender,         engine.mochi().balanceOf(address(this))     ); } ``` Also, the front-end should calculate the min amount with the current price.
