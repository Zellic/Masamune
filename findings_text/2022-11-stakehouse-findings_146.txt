However, `Syndicate.stake` only allows a total staking amount of 12 ETH and reverts otherwise: ```solidity if (_sETHAmount + totalStaked > 12 ether) revert InvalidStakeAmount(); ``` An attacker can abuse this and front-run calls to `mintDerivatives` (which call `_autoStakeWithSyndicate` internally). Because `Syndicate.stake` can be called by everyone, he can stake the minimum amount (1 gwei) such that the `mintDerivatives` call fails.  ## Proof Of Concept As soon as there is a `mintDerivatives` call in the mempool, an attacker (that owns sETH) calls `Syndicate.stake` with an amount of 1 gwei. `_autoStakeWithSyndicate` will still call `Syndicate.stake` with 12 ether. However, `_sETHAmount + totalStaked > 12 ether` will then be true, meaning that the call will revert.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Only allow staking through the LiquidStakingManager, i.e. add access control to `Syndicate.stake`.
