# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The canAddLiquidity modifier, which is used on all deposits (each deposit costs 0.5M gas), appears to be an expensive modifier because it calculates the sum of all the supplies across controlled tokens (by making external CALLs) and adding that up with reserve and timelock supplies. While this is an extensible implementation that supports arbitrary number of controlled tokens via mapped singly linked list, the prize pools typically have only two controlled tokens: tickets and sponsorship.   Impact: deposits currently cost 0.5M gas.  ## Proof of Concept  https://docs.pooltogether.com/protocol/overview#gas-usage  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L276  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L300  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L1119-L1122  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L1069-L1072  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L1054-L1064  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider gas profiling a fast-path calculation by keeping a separate state variable that tracks the sum of timelock+reserve along with all deposits made towards controlled token supplies and comparing new deposits with that state variable instead of reevaluating totals during each deposit. The extra SLOADs, CALLs and other expensive operations (in linked list and other logic) during reevaluation may add up to more than updating this proposed new state variable across different operations.
