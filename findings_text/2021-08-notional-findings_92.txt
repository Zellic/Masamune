# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  On `ExchangeRate.sol`, we are using `latestRoundData`, but there are no validations that the data is not stale.  The current code is:  ```solidity             (                 /* uint80 */,                 rate,                 /* uint256 */,                 /* uint256 */,                 /* uint80 */             ) = AggregatorV2V3Interface(rateOracle).latestRoundData();             require(rate > 0, "ExchangeRate: invalid rate"); ```  But is missing the checks to validate the data is stale   ```solidity (roundId, rawPrice,, updatedAt, answeredInRound) = AggregatorV2V3Interface(rateOracle).latestRoundData(); require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round"); require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price"); ```  More information: https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round
