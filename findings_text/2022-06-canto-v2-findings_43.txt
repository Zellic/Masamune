In the following cases a denial of service will occur: - In the case that is used an `amount` different than the balance, the transaction will be reverted. - **In the case that an attacker front-runs the transaction and sends one token more than the established by the `_accountant`.** - In case of increasing balance tokens like `mDai` that constantly change their balance, the established by the `_accountant` will be different when the transaction is persisted.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - Use balance differences instead of the 0 check.
