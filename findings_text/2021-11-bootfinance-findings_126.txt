# Handle  nathaniel   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Inconsistency between the `claim()` function and `claimExact()` function, in that `claimExact` does not check the claimable amount. In the scenario where claimable = 0, and `investors[msg.sender].claimed != 0` then it will attempt to underflow. If `_amount` is 0, then it could potentially reach the `vestLock.vest()` function, where it will then revert with the inaccurate message "amount must be positive" which doesn't reflect the underlying issue.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L145 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L121 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/Vesting.sol#L75  ## Tools Used manual review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add `require(claimable > 0)`
