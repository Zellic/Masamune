# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It's possible to avoid paying insurance in the following way: - once per hour (at the right moment), do the following: ----using a flash loan, or with a large amount of tokens, call deposit of Insurance.sol to make sure that the pool is sufficiently filled (poolHoldings > poolTarget) ----call the function executeTrade of Trader.sol with a minimal trade (possibly of value 0, see finding "executeTrade with same trades") ----executeTrade calls matchOrders, which calls recordTrade ----recordTrade calls updateFundingRate();   (once per hour, so you have to be sure you do it in time before other trades trigger this) ----updateFundingRate calls getPoolFundingRate ----getPoolFundingRate determines the insurance rate, but because the insurance pool is sufficiently full (due to the flash loan), the rate is 0 ----updateFundingRate stores the 0 rate via setInsuranceFundingRate  (which is used later on to calculate the amounts for the insurances) ----withdraw from the Insurance and pay back the flash loan  The insurance rates are 0 now and no-one pays insurance. The gas costs relative to the insurance costs + the flash loan fees determine if this is an economically viable attack. Otherwise it is still a grief attack This will probably be detected pretty soon because the insurance pool will stay empty. However its difficult to prevent.  ## Proof of Concept  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L45 function deposit(uint256 amount) external override {  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L74 function withdraw(uint256 amount) external override {  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L69      function recordTrade(uint256 tradePrice) external override onlyTracer {       ..         if (startLastHour <= block.timestamp - 1 hours) {            ..             updateFundingRate();  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L141 function updateFundingRate() internal {       ..         int256 iPoolFundingRate = insurance.getPoolFundingRate().toInt256();       ..         int256 iPoolFundingRateValue = currentInsuranceFundingRateValue + iPoolFundingRate;      ..         setInsuranceFundingRate(iPoolFundingRate, iPoolFundingRateValue);  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L204 function getPoolFundingRate() external view override returns (uint256) {      ..         // If the pool is above the target, we don't pay the insurance funding rate         if (poolTarget <= poolHoldings) {             return 0;         }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Set a timelock on withdrawing insurance
