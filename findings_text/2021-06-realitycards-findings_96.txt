# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The code base uses a mix of named return values and explicit returns. In some places, the named return values are never assigned to and explicit returns are used instead.   Impact: This makes code readability and auditability hard potentially leading to errors and missed vulnerabilities.  ## Proof of Concept  Named return value shouldContinue is never assigned in _collectRentAction(): https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L856   Named return value didUpdateEverything is never assigned in _collectRent(): https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L1040  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove unassigned named return variables and be consistent in named vs explicit return usage.
