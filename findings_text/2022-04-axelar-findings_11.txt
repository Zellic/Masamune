Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.   ## Proof of Concept The low-level functions `call` and `delegatecall` are used in some places in the code and it can be problematic. For example, in the `_callERC20Token` of the `AxelarGateway` contract there is a low level call in order to call the ERC20 functions, but if the given `tokenAddress` doesn't exist `success` will be equal to true and the function will return true and the code execution will be continued like the call was successful.  ```sol function _callERC20Token(address tokenAddress, bytes memory callData) internal returns (bool) {     (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = tokenAddress.call(callData);     return success && (returnData.length == uint256(0) || abi.decode(returnData, (bool))); } ``` Another place that this can happen is in `AxelarGatewayProxy`'s constructor ```sol constructor(address gatewayImplementation, bytes memory params) {     _setAddress(KEY_IMPLEMENTATION, gatewayImplementation);     (bool success, ) = gatewayImplementation.delegatecall(        abi.encodeWithSelector(IAxelarGateway.setup.selector, params)    );      if (!success) revert SetupFailed(); } ``` If the `gatewayImplementation` address doesn't exist, the delegate call will return true and the function won't revert.  ## Tools Used Remix, VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check before any low-level call that the address actually exists, for example before the low level call in the callERC20 function you can check that the address is a contract by checking its code size.
