# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Contracts use assert() instead of require() in multiple places. Assert is recommended to be used to check for internal errors, or to check invariants.  In your case, I think these validations could better use 'require' as they are likely to be triggered: assert(claimable > 0); assert(airdrop[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0); assert(block.timestamp - startEpochTime <= RATE_TIME); assert(block.timestamp - initTime >= YEAR * 5);  A similar issue was submitted in a previous contest and was assigned a severity of low: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/83  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider replacing 'assert' with 'require' in the cases mentioned above.
