# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The MarketplaceZap contract conducts a sanity check on the `to` address. One can therefore expect that this check is in place for the StakingZap contract as well.  We also suggest adding another check to ensure that the `to` address is not the StakingZap contract itself. Although there is a `rescue()` function to retrieve funds in these cases, it would be a hassle to do so.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Include the sanity check(s) of the `to` address in the `addLiquidity*()` functions.  ```jsx require(to != address(0) && to != address(this)); ```
