# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The function `withdraw` in the contract `Withdrawable` uses the Solidity keyword, `transfer`, which is unrecommended since it forwards a fixed amount of 2300 gas to the recipient. The gas cost of opcodes may change during hard forks in the future and thus break the functionalities of existing deployed contracts.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Withdrawable.sol#L18](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside/blob/main/contracts/dependencies/Withdrawable.sol#L18)  Please refer to the following references for more details:  [Solidity issue - Remove .send and .transfer](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7455) [Stop Using Solidity's transfer() Now](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use `.call{value: 1 ether}("")` instead of `transfer` or `send`. Besides, since the `call` function forwards all gas to the recipient, the contract should add protections (e.g., reentrancy guards) to prevent the recipient from reentering critical functions.
