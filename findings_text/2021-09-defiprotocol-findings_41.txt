# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The aution contract decides a new `ibRatio` in the function `settleAuction`. [Auction.sol#L89-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L91)  ```solidity         uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();         uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();         uint256 newRatio = a - b; ```  In this equation, `a` would not always be greater than `b`. The ` auctionBonder` may lock the token in `bondForRebalance()` at a point that `a-b` would always revert.  The contract should not allow users to lock the token at the point that not gonna succeed. Given the possible (huge) loss of the user may suffer, I consider this is a medium-risk issue.   ## Proof of Concept Here's a web3.py script to trigger this bug. ```python basket.functions.publishNewIndex([dai.address], [deposit_amount]).transact()  for i in range(4 * 60 * 24):     w3.provider.make_request('evm_mine', []) basket.functions.publishNewIndex([dai.address], [deposit_amount]).transact()  print('auction on going', auction.functions.auctionOngoing().call()) for i in range(20000):     w3.provider.make_request('evm_mine', [])  all_token = basket.functions.balanceOf(user).call() basket.functions.approve(auction.address, all_token).transact() auction.functions.bondForRebalance().transact() # error Log # {'code': -32603, 'message': 'Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)'} auction.functions.settleAuction([], [], [], [], []).transact() ```   ## Tools Used None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend to calculate the new irate in `bondForRebalance`. I understand the `auctionBonder` should take the risk to get the profit. However, the contract should protect the user in the first place when this auction is doomed to fail.
