# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  There are two issues with the governance checks when acquiring them from an NFT:  #### Missing balance check The governance checks in `_updateConvictionScore` are:  ```solidity !isGovernance[user] && userConvictionScore >= governanceThreshold  && balanceOf(user) >= governanceMinimumBalance; ```  Whereas in `acquireConviction`, only `userConvictionScore >= governanceThreshold` is checked but not `&& balanceOf(user) >= governanceMinimumBalance`.  ```solidity else if (     !isGovernance[msg.sender] && userNew >= governanceThreshold ) {     isGovernance[msg.sender] = true; } ```  #### the `wasGovernance` might be outdated  The second issue is that at the time of NFT creation, the `governanceThreshold` or `governanceMinimumBalance` was different and would not qualify for a governor now. The NFT's governance state is blindly appplied to the new user:  ```solidity if (wasGovernance && !isGovernance[msg.sender]) {     isGovernance[msg.sender] = true; } ```  This allows a user to circumvent any governance parameter changes by front-running the change with an NFT creation.  ## Impact It's easy to circumvent the balance check to become a governor by minting and redeeming your own NFT. One can also circumvent any governance parameter increases by front-running these actions with an NFT creation and backrunning with a redemption.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the missing balance check in `acquireConviction`. Remove the `wasGovernance` governance transfer from the NFT and solely recompute it based on the current `governanceThreshold` / `governanceMinimumBalance` settings.
