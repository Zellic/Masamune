# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  `transferFunds()` will transfer funds from a specified yield source `_yieldSource` to the current yield source set in the contract `_currentYieldSource`. However, it fails to check that the deposit tokens are the same. If the specified yield source's assets are of a higher valuation, then a malicious owner or asset manager will be able to exploit and pocket the difference.  ### Proof of Concept  Assumptions:  - `_yieldSource` has a deposit token of WETH (18 decimals) - `_currentYieldSource` has a deposit token of DAI (18 decimals) - 1 WETH > 1 DAI (definitely true, I'd be really sad otherwise)  Attacker does the following:  1. Deposit 100 DAI into the swappable yield source contract 2. Call `transferFunds(_yieldSource, 100 * 1e18)`     - `_requireDifferentYieldSource()` passes     - `_transferFunds(_yieldSource, 100 * 1e18)` is called         - `_yieldSource.redeemToken(_amount);` → This will transfer 100 WETH out of the `_yieldSource` into the contract         - `uint256 currentBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(_yieldSource.depositToken()).balanceOf(address(this));` → This will equate to ≥ 100 WETH.         - `require(_amount <= currentBalance, "SwappableYieldSource/transfer-amount-different");` is true since both are `100 * 1e18`         - `_currentYieldSource.supplyTokenTo(currentBalance, address(this));` → This supplies the transferred 100 DAI from step 1 to the current yield source     - We now have 100 WETH in the swappable yield source contract 3. Call `transferERC20(WETH, attackerAddress, 100 * 1e18)` to withdraw 100 WETH out of the contract to the attacker's desired address.   ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  `_requireDifferentYieldSource()` should also verify that the yield sources' deposit token addresses are the same.  ```jsx function _requireDifferentYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {     require(address(_yieldSource) != address(yieldSource), "SwappableYieldSource/same-yield-source");   require(_newYieldSource.depositToken() == yieldSource.depositToken(), "SwappableYieldSource/different-deposit-token"); } ```
