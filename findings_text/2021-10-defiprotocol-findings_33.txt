# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The functions `Auction.bondForRebalance()`, `Auction.settleAuction()`, `Auction.bondBurn()` and `Auction.withdrawBounty()` read values from storage multiple times instead of caching them in local variables: - `Auction.bondForRebalance()` reads `bondAmount` twice. - `Auction.settleAuction()` reads `bondBlock` twice, `basket` 8 times and `factory` twice. - `Auction.bondBurn()` reads `basket` twice and `bondAmount` twice. - `Auction.withdrawBounty()` reads `bounty.token` twice and `bounty.amount` twice.  ## Impact Storage reads are much more expensive than reading local variables.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Read these values from storage once, cache them in local variables and then read them again from the local variables.
