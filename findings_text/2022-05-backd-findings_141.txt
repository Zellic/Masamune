Inside `LPGauge.sol` when calling `_poolCheckPoint()`, the `lastUpdated` variable is not initalised so defaults to a value of `0`, therefore if the user has managed to stake tokens in the `StakerVault` then the calculated `poolStakedIntegral` will be very large (as block.timestamp is very large). Therefore a user can mint most current available governance tokens for themselves when they claim their rewards (or prevent any governance tokens from being claimed).  ## Proof of Concept 1. LP Gauge and StakerVault contracts are deployed 2. Before the `initializeLpGauge()`, user A will stake 1 token with `stakeFor()` thereby increasing `_poolTotalStaked` by 1. As the `lpgauge` address is equal to the zero address, `_userCheckPoint()` will not be called and `poolLastUpdate` will remain at 0. 3. The user can then directly call `_userCheckPoint()` and be allocated a very large number of shares. This works because `poolLastUpdate` is 0 but the staked amount in the vault is larger than 0 4. Once `initializeLPGauge()` is called, the user can then call `claimRewards()` and receive a very large portion of tokens or if `poolStakedIntegral` exceeds the mint limit set by `Minter.sol` then no one else can claim governance tokens from the lpGauge.  OR 5. A new LP Gauge contract is deployed and added to the vault using `prepareGauge()`. Follow steps 2 to 4.  ## Tools Used Manual audit ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Initialise `poolLastUpdate` in the constructor
