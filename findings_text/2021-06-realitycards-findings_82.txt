# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Misplaced zero-address check for nfthub on L595 in createMarket() because nfthub cannot be 0 at this point as nfthub.addMarket() on L570 would have already reverted if that were the case.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L570  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L595  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Move nfthub zero-address check to before the call to nfthub.addMarket().
