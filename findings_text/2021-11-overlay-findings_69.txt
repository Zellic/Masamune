# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function oiCap() of OverlayV1Comptroller.sol save the value of brrrrdExpected in a tmp variable _brrrrdExpected. Lateron brrrrdExpected is still used while _brrrrdExpected could also be used. This saves a bit of gas.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/market/OverlayV1Comptroller.sol#L255-L279  ```JS  function oiCap() public virtual view returns (  uint cap_ ) {     ...         uint _brrrrdExpected = brrrrdExpected;     ...         cap_ = _surpassed ? 0 : _burnt || _expected             ? _oiCap(false, depth(), staticCap, 0, 0)             : _oiCap(true, depth(), staticCap, _brrrrd, brrrrdExpected);  // can also use _brrrrdExpected  ``` ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace ```JS      : _oiCap(true, depth(), staticCap, _brrrrd, brrrrdExpected); ``` with ```JS      : _oiCap(true, depth(), staticCap, _brrrrd, _brrrrdExpected); ```
