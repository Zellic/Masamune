# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact If you call the function withdrawFees and the "tvl" would not be enough for the fee then the code would revert. In this case the fees cannot be withdrawn. Although it is unlikely that the tvl would be wrong it is probably better to be able to withdraw the remaining fees.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L508 function withdrawFees() external override {         uint256 tempFees = fees;         fees = 0;         tvl = tvl - tempFees;          // Withdraw from the account         IERC20(tracerQuoteToken).transfer(feeReceiver, tempFees);         emit FeeWithdrawn(feeReceiver, tempFees);     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add something like: tempFees = min (fees, tvl); and change fees=0 to: fees -= tempFees;
