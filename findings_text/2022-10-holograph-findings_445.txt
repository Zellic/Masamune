To get pricing estimate, it uses the DstConfig price struct exposed in LZ's [RelayerV2](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/RelayerV2.sol#L133)  The issue is that the important baseGas and gasPerByte configuration parameters, which are used to calculate a custom amount of gas for the destination LZ message, use the values that come from the *source* chain. This is in contrast to LZ which handles DstConfigs in a mapping keyed by chainID.  The encoded gas amount is described [here](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/guides/advanced/relayer-adapter-parameters)  ## Impact  The impact is that when those fields are different between chains, one of two things may happen: 1. Less severe - we waste excess gas, which is refunded to the lzReceive() caller (Layer Zero) 2. More severe - we underprice the delivery cost, causing lzReceive() to revert and the NFT stuck in limbo forever.  The code does not handle a failed lzReceive (differently to a failed executeJob). Therefore, no failure event is emitted and the NFT is screwed.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Firstly,make sure to use the target gas costs. Secondly, re-engineer lzReceive to be fault-proof, i.e. save some gas to emit result event.
