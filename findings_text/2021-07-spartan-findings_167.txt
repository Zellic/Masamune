# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `SynthVault.harvestSingle` function can be used to mint & deposit synths without using a lockup. An attacker sends `BASE` tokens to the pool and then calls `harvestSingle`. The inner `iPOOL(_poolOUT).mintSynth(synth, address(this));` call will mint synth tokens to the vault based on the total `BASE` balance sent to the pool, including the attacker's previous transfer. They are then credited the entire amount to their `weight`.  This essentially acts as a (mint +) deposit without a lock-up period.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Sync the pool before sending `BASE` to it through `iRESERVE(_DAO().RESERVE()).grantFunds(reward, _poolOUT);` such that any previous `BASE` transfer is wasted. This way only the actual reward's weight is increased.
