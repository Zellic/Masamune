# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L62-L63  ```solidity // this is used to have the contract upgradeable function initialize(uint128 minStakedRequired) public initializer { ```  Based on the context and comments in the code, the `DelegatedStaking.sol` contract is designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy contract.  However, the current implementaion is using an non-upgradeable version of the `Ownbale` library: `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol` instead of the upgradeable version: `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol`.  A regular, non-upgradeable `Ownbale` library will make the deployer the default owner in the constructor. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. Therefore, there will be no owner when the contract is deployed as a proxy contract.  As a result, all the `onlyOwner` functions will be inaccessible.  ### Recommendation  Use `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol` instead.  And change the `initialize()` function to:  ```solidity function initialize(uint128 minStakedRequired) public initializer {     __Ownable_init();     ... } ```
