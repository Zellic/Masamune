# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/redeemer/Redeemer.sol#L262   # Vulnerability details  Sense's `redeem` can be totally DOSd due to user supplied input.  ## Impact Using this attack, Sense market can not be redeemed.  ## Proof of Concept [This](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/redeemer/Redeemer.sol#L253:#L262) is how Sense market is being redeemed: ```         IERC20 token = IERC20(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, p));         uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(lender);         Safe.transferFrom(token, lender, address(this), amount);         ISense(d).redeem(o, m, amount); ``` The problem is that `d` is user supplied input and the function only tries to redeem the amount that was transferred from Lender.  A user can supply malicious `d` contract which does nothing on `redeem(o, m, amount)`. The user will then call Redeemer's `redeem` with his malicious contract. Redeemer will transfer all the prinicipal from Lender to itself, will call `d` (noop), and finish. Sense market has not been redeemed.  Now if somebody tries to call Sense market's `redeem` again, the `amount` variable will be 0, and Redeemer will try to redeem 0 from Sense.  All the original principal is locked and lost in the contract, like tears in rain.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think you should either use a whitelisted Sense address, or send to `ISense(d).redeem` Redeemer's whole principal balance.
