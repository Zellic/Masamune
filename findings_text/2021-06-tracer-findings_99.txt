# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The pool holdings of `Insurance` (`publicCollateralAmount` and `bufferCollateralAmount`) is in WAD (18 decimals) but it's used as a raw token value in `drainPool`  ```solidity // amount is a mix of pool holdings, i.e., 18 decimals // this requires amount to be in RAW! if tracerMarginToken has > 18 decimals, it'll break, < 18 decimals will approve too much tracerMarginToken.approve(address(tracer), amount); // this requires amount to be in WAD which is correct tracer.deposit(amount); ```  ## Impact  If `tracerMarginToken` has less than 18 decimals, the approval approves orders of magnitude more tokens than required for the `deposit` call that follows. If `tracerMarginToken` has more than 18 decimals, the `deposit` that follows would fail as fewer tokens were approved, but the protocol seems to disallow tokens in general with more than 18 decimals.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Convert the `amount` to a "raw token value" and approve this one instead.
