# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  In the `_approve` function, if the allowance passed in is `type(uint256).max`, nothing happens (ie. allowance will still remain at previous value). Contract integrations (DEXes for example) tend to hardcode this value to set maximum allowance initially, but this will result in zero allowance given instead.  This also makes the comment `// No need to re-approve if already max` misleading, because the max allowance attainable is `type(uint256).max - 1`, and re-approval does happen in this case.  This affects the `approveAndCall` implementation since it uses `type(uint256).max` as the allowance amount, but the resulting allowance set is zero.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Keep it simple, remove the condition.  ```jsx function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {         require(owner != address(0), "!owner");         require(spender != address(0), "!spender");         _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;         emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);     } ```
