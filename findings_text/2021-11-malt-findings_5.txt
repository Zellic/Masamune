# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Greater costs of epoch advancement  ## Proof of Concept  The `Advance` event emits the block number and timestamp in its data  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L24  These fields are attached to events by default so it's unnecessary to manually emit them (and pay the associated gas costs)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove `block` and `timestamp` fields from `Advance` event
