# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Repetitive and expensive SSTORE opcode operations inside loops  ## Proof of Concept ```  totalAllocatedCredit -= _available (contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#368)  totalAllocatedCredit -= _decrease (contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#395)  totalAllocatedCredit += _allocate (contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#401) ```  ## Tools Used Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Create a memory variable which will be used to compute a `_totalAllocatedCredit` that will get added to `totalAllocatedCredit` storage variable outside the loop. As an idea, you could create 1 such `int` variable and use it's value after the for-loop, or you could create 2 uint variables where 1 would store the _totalDecrease and 1 would store the _totalAllocate, and respectively substract and add them.
