# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `getEtherPrice` function in the contract `FSDNetwork` fetches the ETH price from a Chainlink aggregator using the `latestRoundData` function. However, there are no checks on `roundID` nor `timeStamp`, resulting in stale prices.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [FSDNetwork.sol#L376-L381](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L376-L381)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is uncomplete, for example:  ```solidity (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = ETH_CHAINLINK.latestRoundData(); require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "..."); require(timeStamp != 0, "..."); ```
