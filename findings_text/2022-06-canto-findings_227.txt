An attacker can transfer any amount of the underlying asset directly to the contract and make all of the functions requiring getCashPrior() == 0 to revert.   ## Proof of Concept [CNote.sol#L43](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L43) [CNote.sol#L114](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L114) [CNote.sol#198](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L198) [CNote.sol#310](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L310)  1. Attacker gets any balance of Note (amount = 1 token) 2. Attacker transfers the token to CNote which uses Note as an underlying asset, by calling note.transfer(CNoteAddress, amount). The function is available since Note inherits from ERC20 3. Any calls to CNote functions now revert due to getCashPrior() not being equal to 0  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Instead of checking the underlying token balance via balanceOf(address(this)) the contract could hold an internal balance of the token, mitigating the impact of tokens being forcefully transferred to the contract.
