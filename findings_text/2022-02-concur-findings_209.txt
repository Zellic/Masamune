However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.  As a result, if the `rewardsDistribution` mistakenly `notifyRewardAmount` with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.  ### PoC  Given:  - rewardsDuration = 7 days;  1. Alice stakes `1,000` stakingToken; 2. `rewardsDistribution` sends `100` rewardsToken to the contract; 3. `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `amount` = `100`; 4. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` and it returns `100` rewardsToken, but Alice choose not to `getReward()` for now; 5. `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `amount` = `100` without send any fund to contract, the tx will succees; 6. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` `200` rewardsToken, when Alice tries to call `getReward()`, the transaction will fail due to insufficient balance of rewardsToken.  Expected Results:  The tx in step 5 should revert.  ### Recommendation  Consider changing the function `notifyRewardAmount` to `addRward` and use `transferFrom` to transfer rewardsToken into the contract:  ```solidity function addRward(uint256 reward)     external     updateReward(address(0)) {     require(         msg.sender == rewardsDistribution,         "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract"     );      if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {         rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;     } else {         uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;         uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;         rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;     }      rewardsToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reward);      lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;     periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;     emit RewardAdded(reward); } ```
