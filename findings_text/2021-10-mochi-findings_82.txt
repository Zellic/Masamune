# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Redundant arithmetic underflow/overflow checks can be avoided when an underflow/overflow cannot happen.  ## Proof of Concept  The "unchecked" keyword can be applied here since there is an "if" statement before to ensure the arithmetic operations, would not cause an integer underflow or overflow. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L267  Change the code at 267 to: <code> unchecked {    debts -= _amount; } </code>  A similar change can be made here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L269  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the "unchecked" keyword as shown above.
