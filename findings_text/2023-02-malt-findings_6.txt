At the same time, distributed cannot exceed balance, which means that if balance < linearBondedValue * netVest / vestingBondedValue, part of the rewards in netVest will be lost. ```solidity     uint256 netVest = currentlyVested - previouslyVested;     uint256 netTime = block.timestamp - previouslyVestedTimestamp;      if (netVest == 0 || vestingBondedValue == 0) {       return;     }      uint256 linearBondedValue = rewardMine.valueOfBonded();      uint256 distributed = (linearBondedValue * netVest) / vestingBondedValue;     uint256 balance = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));      if (distributed > balance) {       distributed = balance;     }  ``` At the end of the function, previouslyVested is directly assigned to currentlyVested instead of using the Vested adjusted according to distributed, which means that the previously lost rewards will also be skipped in the next distribution. ```solidity     previouslyVested = currentlyVested;     previouslyVestedTimestamp = block.timestamp; ``` Also, in the next distribution, bufferRequirement will be small because distributed is small, so it may increase the number of forfeits. ```     if (netTime < buf) {       bufferRequirement = (distributed * buf * 10000) / netTime / 10000;     } else {       bufferRequirement = distributed;     }      if (balance > bufferRequirement) {       // We have more than the buffer required. Forfeit the rest       uint256 net = balance - bufferRequirement;       _forfeit(net);     } ``` ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-malt/blob/700f9b468f9cf8c9c5cffaa1eba1b8dea40503f9/contracts/RewardSystem/LinearDistributor.sol#L111-L153 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adapting previouslyVested based on distributed ```diff     uint256 linearBondedValue = rewardMine.valueOfBonded();      uint256 distributed = (linearBondedValue * netVest) / vestingBondedValue;     uint256 balance = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));      if (distributed > balance) {       distributed = balance; +    currentlyVested = distributed * vestingBondedValue / linearBondedValue + previouslyVested;     } ```
