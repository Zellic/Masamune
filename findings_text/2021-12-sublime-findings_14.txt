# Handle  0x1f8b   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas saving.  ## Proof of Concept  It's possible to optimize the struct CreditLineConstants from CreditLine contract, the last 4 fields spend 3 storage slots, moving the boolean values between the address values, it will spend only two slots as follows:  ```struct CreditLineConstants {         address lender;         address borrower;         uint256 borrowLimit;         uint256 idealCollateralRatio;         uint256 borrowRate;         address borrowAsset;         bool autoLiquidation;         address collateralAsset;         bool requestByLender;     }```.  ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Reorder the structs fields
