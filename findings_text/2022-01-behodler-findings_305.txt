# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  A logic error in the `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function that resets a user's `pendingFlashDecision` allows that user to steal other user's assets locked in future flash governance decisions. As a result, attackers can get their funds back even if they execute a malicious flash decision and the community burns their assets.  ## Proof of Concept  1. An attacker Alice executes a malicious flash governance decision, and her assets are locked in the `FlashGovernanceArbiter` contract. 2. The community disagrees with Alice's flash governance decision and calls `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` to burn her locked assets. However, the `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function resets Alice's `pendingFlashDecision` to the default config (see line 134). 3. A benign user, Bob executes another flash governance decision, and his assets are locked in the contract.  4. Now, Alice calls `withdrawGovernanceAsset` to withdraw Bob's locked asset, effectively the same as stealing Bob's assets. Since Alice's `pendingFlashDecision` is reset to the default, the `unlockTime < block.timestamp` condition is fulfilled, and the withdrawal succeeds.
