# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  Since `claimReward` can only be called after `endRewardLock`, `lastApplicableTime` will always return `endStream`.  ## Impact Some gas can be saved.  ## Proof of Concept `claimReward` will only run if time > endRewardLock (which is >= endStream): ``` require(block.timestamp > endRewardLock, "lock"); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L556 `claimReward` is calling `lastApplicableTime`: ``` lastUpdate = lastApplicableTime(); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L567 And this is `lastApplicableTime`: ``` return block.timestamp <= endStream ? uint32(block.timestamp) : endStream; ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L340 Therefore, it will always return `endStream`.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In `claimReward`, change this line: ``` lastUpdate = lastApplicableTime(); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L340 To: ``` lastUpdate = endStream; ```
