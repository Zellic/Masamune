There are also other places that could use this.  ## Have NatSpec comments for all functions ## Avoid the diamond standard  The most significant optimization that can be done in the contract is to get rid of the diamond standard, because, proxy architectures are inherently expensive. Unless there are specific reasons, such as contract size limits, a diamond makes the contract unnecessary complex. Also, try to avoid upgradability if you can afford it.
