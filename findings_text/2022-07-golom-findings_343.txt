There are a number of issues with using `.transfer()`, as it can fail for a number of reasons (specified in the Proof of Concept).  ### Proof of Concept  1. The destination is a smart contract that doesn’t implement a `payable` function or it implements a `payable` function but that function uses more than 2300 gas units. 2. The destination is a smart contract that doesn’t implement a `payable` `fallback` function or it implements a `payable` `fallback` function but that function uses more than 2300 gas units. 3. The destination is a smart contract but that smart contract is called via an intermediate proxy contract increasing the case requirements to more than 2300 gas units. A further example of unknown destination complexity is that of a multisig wallet that as part of its operation uses more than 2300 gas units. 4. Future changes or forks in Ethereum result in higher gas fees than transfer provides. The `.transfer()` creates a hard dependency on 2300 gas units being appropriate now and into the future.  ### Tools Used  Vim  ### Recommended Remediation Steps  Instead use the `.call()` function to transfer ether and avoid some of the limitations of `.transfer()`. This would be accomplished by changing `payEther()` to something like;  ```solidity (bool success, ) = payable(payAddress).call{value: payAmt}(""); // royalty transfer to royaltyaddress require(success, "Transfer failed."); ```  Gas units can also be passed to the `.call()` function as a variable to accomodate any uses edge cases. Gas could be a mutable state variable that can be set by the contract owner.
