# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Suppose you are an investor and want to claim the last part of your claimable tokens (or your entire set of claimable tokens if you haven't claimed anything yet). Then you call the function claim() of InvestorDistribution.sol, which has the following statement: "require(investors[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);" This statement will prevent you from claiming your tokens because it will stop execution.  Note: with the function claimExact() it is possible to claim the last part.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L113-L128  function claim() external nonReentrant { ...         require(investors[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);         investors[msg.sender].amount -= claimable;  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the require statement.
