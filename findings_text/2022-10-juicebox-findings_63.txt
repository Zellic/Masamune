This generally works well because in the function `reservedTokenBeneficiaryOf(address _nft, uint256 _tierId)`, `defaultReservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[_nft]` is used as a backup when `_reservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[_nft][_tierId]` is not set. However, it will lead to the wrong beneficiary when `defaultReservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[msg.sender]` is later changed, as this new beneficiary will be used for the tier, which is not the intended one.  ## Proof Of Concept `defaultReservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[address(delegate)]` is originally set to `address(Bob)` when the following happens: 1.) A new tier 42 is added with `_tierToAdd.reservedTokenBeneficiary = address(Bob)`. Because this is equal to `defaultReservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[address(delegate)]`, `_reservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[msg.sender][_tierId]` is not set. 2.) The owner calls `setDefaultReservedTokenBeneficiary` to change the default beneficiary (i.e., the value `defaultReservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[address(delegate)]`) to `address(Alice)`. 3.) Now, every call to `reservedTokenBeneficiaryOf(address(delegate), 42)` will return `address(Alice)`, meaning she will get these reserved tokens. This is of course wrong, the tier was explicitly created with Bob as the beneficiary.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Also set `_reservedTokenBeneficiaryOf[msg.sender][_tierId]` when it is equal to the current default beneficiary.
