# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L200-L225  ```solidity function fillZrxQuote(     IERC20 zrxBuyTokenAddress,     address payable zrxTo,     bytes calldata zrxData,     uint256 ethAmount ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {     uint256 originalERC20Balance = 0;     if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {         originalERC20Balance = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this));     }     uint256 originalETHBalance = address(this).balance;      (bool success,) = zrxTo.call{value: ethAmount}(zrxData);     require(success, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Failed to fill quote");      uint256 ethDelta = address(this).balance.subOrZero(originalETHBalance);     uint256 erc20Delta;     if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {         erc20Delta = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)).subOrZero(originalERC20Balance);         require(erc20Delta > 0, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Didn't receive bought token");     } else {         require(ethDelta > 0, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Didn't receive bought ETH");     }      return (erc20Delta, ethDelta); } ```  When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be `0`.   That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.  Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is `1 ETH` before the swap.  - A user swaps `10 ETH` to USDC; - `originalETHBalance` will be `11 ETH`; - If there is `1 ETH` of refund; - `ethDelta` will be `0` as the new balance is `2 ETH` and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is `0`.  Similarly, `erc20Delta` is also computed wrong.  Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from `WBTC` to `WBTC`, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, `erc20Delta` will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.  For example, for an arb swap from `1 WBTC` to `1.1 WBTC`, the `ethDelta` will be `0.1 WBTC` while it should be `1.1 WBTC`.  ### Impact  - User can not get ETH refund for swaps from ETH to ERC20 tokens; - Arb swap with the same input and output token will suffer the loss of almost all of their input amount unexpectedly.  ### Recommendation  Consider subtracting the input amount from the originalBalance.
