# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  While safeApprove is used in the Factory contract, the use of ERC20 approve in approveUnderlying() (instead of safeApprove) is presumably to handle the reapprovals during changing of index but is susceptible to the historical ERC20 approve() race condition.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L226  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L106  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Be aware that this is susceptible to race-condition but this it unlikely a concern because the spender is always the auction contract which is cloned and therefore trusted.
