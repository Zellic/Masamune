# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function deposit of RCTreasury.sol resets the isForeclosed state and emits LogUserForeclosed, if the use have enough funds. However this also happens if the user is not Foreclosed and so the emit is redundant and confusing.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L279 function deposit(uint256 _amount, address _user) public override balancedBooks returns (bool) {    ....         // this deposit could cancel the users foreclosure         if ( (user[_user].deposit + _amount) > (user[_user].bidRate / minRentalDayDivisor) ) {             isForeclosed[_user] = false;             emit LogUserForeclosed(_user, false);         }         return true;     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Only do the emit when isForeclosed was true
