# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In case the reward token is changed, `totalDeclaredReward` will be changed and likely equal to `0`.  Since `_userStakePadding` and `_globalStakePadding` are accumulated, changing the reward token will not reset those values. Thus, it will create problems.  ## Recommendation  I think it would be the best to remove this function.   If you want to keep it, then it must have an event and it should be used by a timelock contract. Furthermore, it has to be used carefully and the new token should be distributed such that padding variables still make sense.
