# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  On L158 of swap.sol, you use a uint8 as the for loop variable:  Due to how the EVM natively works on 256 numbers, using a 8 bit number here introduces additional costs as the EVM has to properly enforce the limits of this smaller type.  See the warning at this link: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage
