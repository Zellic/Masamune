# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `Vader._transfer` function burns the transfer fee on `msg.sender` but this address might not be involved in the transfer at all due to `transferFrom`.  ## Impact  Smart contracts that simply relay transfers like aggregators have their Vader balance burned or the transaction fails because these accounts don't have any balance to burn, breaking the functionality.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It should first increase the balance of `recipient` by the full amount and then burn the fee on the `recipient`.
