# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol#L93-L97   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The batch operations of `withdrawDETH()` in GiantSavETHVaultPool.sol and `withdrawLPTokens()` in GiantPoolBase.sol are meaningless because they will fail whenever more than one lpToken is passed. Each user can perform `withdrawDETH()` or `withdrawLPTokens()` with one LPToken only once a day.  ## Proof of Concept  Both the `withdrawDETH()` in GiantSavETHVaultPool.sol and `withdrawLPTokens()` in GiantPoolBase.sol will call `GiantPoolBase._assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP(lpToken, amount)` and `lpTokenETH.burn(msg.sender, amount)`:  There is a require in `_assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP()`: ``` require(lpTokenETH.lastInteractedTimestamp(msg.sender) + 1 days < block.timestamp, "Too new"); ```  At the same time, `lpTokenETH.burn(msg.sender, amount)` will update `lastInteractedTimestamp[msg.sender]` to latest block timestamp in `_afterTokenTransfer()` of GiantLP.sol.  So, a user can perform `withdrawDETH` or `withdrawLPTokens` of one LPToken only once a day, others more will fail by `_assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP()`.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The LPToken being operated on should be checked for lastInteractedTimestamp rather than lpTokenETH.  ``` diff --git a/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol b/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol index 8a8ff70..5c009d9 100644 --- a/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol +++ b/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol @@ -93,7 +93,7 @@ contract GiantPoolBase is ReentrancyGuard {      function _assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP(LPToken _token, uint256 _amount) internal view {          require(_amount >= MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT, "Invalid amount");          require(_token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Pool does not own specified LP"); -        require(lpTokenETH.lastInteractedTimestamp(msg.sender) + 1 days < block.timestamp, "Too new"); +        require(_token.lastInteractedTimestamp(msg.sender) + 1 days < block.timestamp, "Too new");      }       /// @dev Allow an inheriting contract to have a hook for performing operations post depositing ETH ```
