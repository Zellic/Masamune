# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  Some tokens don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their `approve` function returns `void` instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.  Calls to `.approve` with user-defined tokens are made in: - `MISOLauncher.createLauncher` - `MISOMarket.createMarket`  ## Impact Tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the mentioned contracts as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We recommend using OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` versions with the `safeApprove` function that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
