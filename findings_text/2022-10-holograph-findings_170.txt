An example of a price spike can be in the recent month in the Ethereum Mainnet where the min gas price was 3 at Oct 8, but jumped to 14 the day after and didn't go down since then (the min on Oct 9 was lower than the avg of Oct8, but users might witness a momentarily low gas price and try to hope on it). See the [gas price chat on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) for more details.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  In case of a gas price spike, instead of refusing to let other operators to execute the job, let them execute the job without slashing the selected operator. This way, after a while also the owner can execute the job and pay the gas price.
