# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In LifeGuard3Pool (LG) deposit(), lp token balance is determined for the crv3pool.add_liquidity() call. Given that LG does not hold any lp tokens between txs, there is no need to determine and subtract lp token balance before and after the curve add liquidity call. Removing the call on L204 will save at least 2600+2100=4700 gas from the external call.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L204-L206  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the call on L204 and just get the balance on L206 without any subtraction.
