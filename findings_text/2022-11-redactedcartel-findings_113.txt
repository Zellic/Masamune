While there is at least one deposit/stake ('_addLiquidity()') operation in the past 'cooldownDuration' time, redemption would fail. Obviously this limitation is user-based,  and 'PirexGmx' contract is one such user.  https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts/blob/c3618b0d6fc1b88819393dc7e6c785e32e78c72b/contracts/core/GlpManager.sol#L234  ``` Current setting of 'cooldownDuration' is 15 minutes, the max value is 2 days. ``` https://arbiscan.io/address/0x321f653eed006ad1c29d174e17d96351bde22649#readContract  Due to the above limit, there are 3 risks that can block redemption for Pirex users.  1.__The normal case__ Let's say there is 10% GMX users will use Pirex to manage their GLP.  By checking recent history of GMX router contract, we can find the average stake interval is smaller than 1 minute https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa906f338cb21815cbc4bc87ace9e68c87ef8d8f1 Let's take ``` averageStakeIntervalOfGMX = 30 seconds ``` So if Pirex has 10% of GMX users, then ``` averageStakeIntervalOfPirex = 30 ÷ 10% = 300 seconds ``` The probability of successfully redeeming is a typical Poisson distribution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution With ``` λ = cooldownDuration ÷ averageStakeIntervalOfPirex = 15 * 60 ÷ 300 = 3 k = 0 ``` So we get ``` P ≈ 1 ÷ (2.718 * 2.718 * 2.718) ≈ 0.05  ``` Conclusion ``` If Pirex has 10 % of GMX users, then the redemption will fail with 95% probability. ```  A full list of % of GMX users versus failure probability of redemption ``` 1% : 26% 5% : 78% 10% : 95% 20% : 99.75% 30% : 99.98% ```  2.__The attack case__ If an attacker, such as bad competitors of similar projects, try to exploit this vulnerability. Let's estimate the cost for attack.  As attacker can deposit a very small GLP, such as 1 wei, so we can ignore the GLP cost and only focus on GAS cost.  By checking the explorer history https://arbiscan.io We are safe to assume the cost for calling 'depositGlpETH()' or 'depositGlp' is ``` txCost = 0.1 USD ```  To block redemption, attacker have to execute a deposit call every 15 minutes, so ``` dailyCost = 24 * (60 / 15) * 0.1 = 9.6 USD yearCost = 365 * 9.6 = 3504 USD ``` Conclusion ``` If an attacker want to block Pirex users funds, his yearly cost is only about 3.5k USD. ```  3.__GMX adjusts protocol parameters__ If GMX increases 'cooldownDuration' to 2 days, it will obviously cause redemption not working.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Reserve some time range for redemption only. e.g. 1 of every 7 days.
