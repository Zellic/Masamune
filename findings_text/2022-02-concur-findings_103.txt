This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.  Even if the `claimed` mapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address, not the `msg.sender` address.  Remediation is to change the `_to` to `msg.sender`. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/Shelter.sol#L55
