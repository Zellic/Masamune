# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The V1 version of YieldMath.sol contains ">=" (larger or equal), while the V2 version of YieldMath.sol containt ">" (larger) in the log_2 function. This change doesn't seem logical and might lead to miss calculations. The difference is present in a number of adjacent lines.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-v1/blob/master/contracts/YieldMath.sol#L217 function log_2 (uint128 x) ... b = b * b >> 127; if (b >= 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) {b >>= 1; l |= 0x1000000000000000000000000000000;}   //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/main/contracts/yieldspace/YieldMath.sol#L58 function log_2(uint128 x) ... b = b * b >> 127; if(b > 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) {b >>= 1; l |= 0x1000000000000000000000000000000;}  ## Tools Used diff  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check which version is the correct version and fix the incorrect version.
