# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There exist ERC20 tokens that charge a fee for every transfer.  This kind of token does not work correctly with the `TwabRewards` contract as the rewards calculation for an user is based on `promotion.tokensPerEpoch` (see line [320](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L320)).  However, the actual amount of tokens the contract holds could be less than `promotion.tokensPerEpoch * promotion.numberOfEpochs` leading to not claimable rewards for users claiming later than others.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  To disable fee-on transfer tokens for the contract, add the following code in `createPromotion` around line 11: ``` uint256 oldBalance = _token.balanceOf(address(this)); _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokensPerEpoch * _numberOfEpochs); uint256 newBalance = _token.balanceOf(address(this)); require(oldBalance + _tokenPerEpoch * _numberOfEpochs == newBalance); ```
