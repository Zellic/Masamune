# Handle  0x1f8b   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Signature replay in `PoolTemplate`.  ## Proof of Concept The `redeem` method of `PoolTemplate` verifies the data stored in `incident`, and the verification logic of this process is performed as following:  ``` require(             MerkleProof.verify(                 _merkleProof,                 _targets,                 keccak256(                     abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, _insurance.insured)                 )             ) ||                 MerkleProof.verify(                     _merkleProof,                     _targets,                     keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, address(0)))                 ),             "ERROR: INSURANCE_EXEMPTED"         ); ```  As can be seen, the only data related to the `_insurance` are` target` and `insured`, so as the incident has no relation with the` Insurance`, apparently nothing prevents a user to call `insure` with high amounts, after receive the incident, the only thing that prevents this from being reused is that the owner creates the incident with an `_incidentTimestamp` from the past.  So if a owner create a incident from the future it's possible to create a new `insure` that could be reused by the same affected address.  Another lack of input verification that could facilitate this attack is the `_span=0` in the `insure` method.  ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It is mandatory to add a check in `applyCover` that` _incidentTimestamp` is less than the current date and the `span` argument is greater than 0 in the` insure` method.
