# Handle  toastedsteaksandwich   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The _setCompAddress() function in the Comptroller contract does not emit an event when changing the comp address. While this does not impose any security risk, it does hinder a users ability to view any changes made to the comp address through the contract's lifetime.   ## Affected line https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-basedloans/blob/main/code/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1354  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It is recommended to emit an event indicating the old comp address, and the new comp address to be used when calling the _setCompAddress() function. An example of such an event is `event NewCompAddress(address oldCompAddress, address newCompAddress)`.
