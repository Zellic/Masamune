It can be called only after contest of another party. ```solidity     function addCredit(         uint128 drate,         uint128 frate,         uint256 amount,         address token,         address lender     )         external         payable         override         whileActive         mutualConsent(lender, borrower)         returns (bytes32)     {         LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(token, lender, amount);           bytes32 id = _createCredit(lender, token, amount);           require(interestRate.setRate(id, drate, frate));                  return id;     } ``` `LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(token, lender, amount)` is responsible for getting payment. https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol#L59-L74 ```solidity     function receiveTokenOrETH(       address token,       address sender,       uint256 amount     )       external       returns (bool)     {         if(token == address(0)) { revert TransferFailed(); }         if(token != Denominations.ETH) { // ERC20             IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);         } else { // ETH             if(msg.value < amount) { revert TransferFailed(); }         }         return true;     } ``` As you can see in case of native token payment, `sender` is not checked to be `msg.sender`, so this makes it's possible that borrower can by mistake pay instead of lender. It sounds funny, but it's possible. What is needed is that lender call `addCredit` first and then borrower calls `addCredit` and provides value.  ## Tools Used VsCode ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check that if payment in ETH then `lender == msg.sender` in `addCredit` function.
