# Handle  Kumpirmafyas   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The order of the "struct Template" in the Factory.sol contract is as follows: 1-bool isOpen 2-bool approval 3-bool allowDuplicate https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/Factory.sol#L44-L48   The struct above is used in functions as value, in the "key=>value" part in this mapping. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/Factory.sol#L49  When using "template" mapping in this function, it is not done in the defined order, Detail: - isOpen bool , defined in Struct in the 1st row, -isOpen bool ,defined in the 1st position in Mapping, naturally -isOpen bool is defined in the 2nd row in the "approveTemplate" function below. -The same applies to the approvel bool struct.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/Factory.sol#L101-L103   The problem here is; The order in which Structs are used in a Function is not. Problem ; The order of the structs in the "key => value" mapping definition affects the function. Sequencing is important in struct definition in mappings.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The order in the struct = the order in the mapping = the order in the function must be the same.  Here ; Sorting in Mapping with Struct is a mandatory condition, while sorting in a function is within the scope of clean code.
