# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  During the manual code review, It has been observed that harvesting and fundings progress is not checked when the contract is halted. This can cause misfunctionality and locking user funds during the halt progress.  ## Proof of Concept  1-) Navigate to "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol" contract. 2-) Observe the following code on the Controller.sol.  Functions earn and HarvestStrategy ```     function harvestStrategy(address _strategy,uint256 _estimatedWETH,uint256 _estimatedYAXIS)         external         override         onlyHarvester         onlyStrategy(_strategy)              function earn(         address _strategy,         address _token,         uint256 _amount     )         external         override         onlyStrategy(_strategy)         onlyVault(_token)  ```  ## Tools Used  None   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement the notHalt modifier into the functions. Only withdraw functions should be allowed on the contract.
