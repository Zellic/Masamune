# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  BONDING_ROLE cannot be managed after it was initialized.  ## Proof of Concept  ```setBonding``` set the wrong role via _swapRole:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/MiningService.sol#L116  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Set ```BONDING_ROLE``` instead of ```REINVESTOR_ROLE``` in ```setBonding``` function:  Now: ``` function setBonding(address _bonding)  public  onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin privs") {  require(_bonding != address(0), "Cannot use address 0");  _swapRole(_bonding, bonding, REINVESTOR_ROLE);  bonding = _bonding; } ```  To be: ``` function setBonding(address _bonding)  public  onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin privs") {  require(_bonding != address(0), "Cannot use address 0");  _swapRole(_bonding, bonding, BONDING_ROLE);  bonding = _bonding; } ```
