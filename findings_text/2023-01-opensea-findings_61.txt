In turn, this will cause the `0x04` precompile within `MemoryPointerLib::copy` to handle the data incorrectly and attempt to copy data from the `srcLength.next().offset(headAndTailSize)` pointer onwards which will be un-allocated space and thus lead to incorrect bytes being copied.  ## Tools Used  Manual inspection of the codebase, documentation of the ETH precompiles, and the Solidity compiler documentation.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  We advise the `offset` instruction to be omitted as the current implementation will copy from unsafe memory space, causing data corruption in the worst-case scenario and incorrect order hashes being specified in the encoded payload. As an additional point, the `_encodeOrderHashes` will fail execution if the array of order hashes is empty as a `headAndTailSize` of `0` will cause the `MemoryPointerLib::copy` function to fail as the precompile would yield a `returndatasize()` of `0`.
