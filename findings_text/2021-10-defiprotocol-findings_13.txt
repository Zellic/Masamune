# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The `public` functions `Basket.mint()`, `Basket.burn()`, `Basket.changePublisher()`, `Basket.changeLicenseFee()`, `Basket.publishNewIndex()` and `Basket.deleteNewIndex()` are never called by `Basket`. Therefore, their visibility can be reduced to `external`.  ## Impact `external` functions are cheaper than `public` functions.  ## Proof of Concept https://gus-tavo-guim.medium.com/public-vs-external-functions-in-solidity-b46bcf0ba3ac  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Define these functions as `public`.
