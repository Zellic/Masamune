# Handle  harleythedog   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The implementation of `_getCurrentEpochId` is: ``` function  _getCurrentEpochId(Promotion  memory  _promotion) internal  view  returns (uint256) {  return (block.timestamp - _promotion.startTimestamp) / _promotion.epochDuration; } ```  This means that if exactly `_promotion.epochDuration` seconds have elapsed since the start timestamp, then  the current epoch is 1, and the 0th epoch is completed. However, there are the following lines of code in `_calculateRewardAmount`:  ``` function  _calculateRewardAmount(  address  _user,  Promotion  memory  _promotion,  uint256  _epochId ) internal  view  returns (uint256) {  uint256 _epochDuration = _promotion.epochDuration;  uint256 _epochStartTimestamp = _promotion.startTimestamp + (_epochDuration * _epochId);  uint256 _epochEndTimestamp = _epochStartTimestamp + _epochDuration;  require(block.timestamp > _epochEndTimestamp, "TwabRewards/epoch-not-over");  ... } ```  If exactly `_promotion.epochDuration` seconds have elapsed since the start timestamp, then this function will revert since the require has a `>` instead of a `>=`.  Thus there are two conflicting definitions of when an epoch ends. In the case of `_getCurrentEpochId`, it is when `_promotion.epochDuration` seconds elapse. In the case of `_calculateRewardAmount`, it is when *more than* `_calculateRewardAmount` seconds elapse. This only makes a difference in one exact second, but it is best to be consistent.  ## Proof of Concept See `_getCurrentEpochId` here: https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L276  See `_calculateRewardAmount` here: https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L289  ## Tools Used Inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change  ``` require(block.timestamp > _epochEndTimestamp, "TwabRewards/epoch-not-over"); ``` to  ``` require(block.timestamp >= _epochEndTimestamp, "TwabRewards/epoch-not-over"); ``` in `_calculateRewardAmount`.
