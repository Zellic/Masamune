# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the function findNewOwner of RCOrderbook, as loop is done which included the check  _loopCounter < maxDeletions Afterwards a check is done for  "(_loopCounter != maxDeletions)" to determine if the processing is finished. If _loopCounter == maxDeletions then the conclusion is that it isn't finished yet.  However there is the edgecase that the processing might just be finished at the same time as _loopCounter == maxDeletions.  You can see this the best if you assume maxDeletions==1, in that case it will never draw the conclusion it is finished. Of course having maxDeletions==1 is very unlikely in practice.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCOrderbook.sol#L549  function findNewOwner(uint256 _card, uint256 _timeOwnershipChanged)  external  override  onlyMarkets  { ...         // delete current owner         do {             _newPrice = _removeBidFromOrderbookIgnoreOwner( _head.next, _market, _card );             _loopCounter++;             // delete next bid if foreclosed         } while (    treasury.foreclosureTimeUser( _head.next, _newPrice,  _timeOwnershipChanged ) <  minimumTimeToOwnTo &&                 _loopCounter < maxDeletions );          if (_loopCounter != maxDeletions) {   // the old owner is dead, long live the new owner             _newOwner = ....              ...         } else {             // we hit the limit, save the old owner, we'll try again next time            ...         }     }   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use a different way to determine that the processing is done. This could save some gas. Note: the additional check also costs gas, so you have the verify the end result.  Perhaps in setDeletionLimit doublecheck that _deletionLimit > 1.
