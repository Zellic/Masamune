# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `enableToken` function performs an `ERC20.approve()` call but does not check the `success` return value. Some tokens do **not** revert if the approval failed but return `false` instead.  ## Impact Tokens that don't actually perform the approve and return `false` are still counted as a correct approve.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We recommend using [OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the `safeApprove` function that handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
