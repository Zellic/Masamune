Trades can happen at a manipulated price and end up receiving fewer tokens than current market price dictates.  Placing severity to be medium as those are system core operations, while funds there can be substantial, so sandwich attacks are often enough economically viable and thus probable, while they result in a partial fund loss.  ## Proof of Concept  All four swapping functions of Marketplace do not allow for slippage control:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L131-L189  ```solidity     /// @notice sells the PT for the PT via the pool     /// @param u address of the underlying asset     /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market     /// @param a amount of PT to swap     /// @return uint128 amount of PT bought     function sellPrincipalToken(         address u,         uint256 m,         uint128 a     ) external returns (uint128) {         IPool pool = IPool(pools[u][m]);         Safe.transfer(IERC20(address(pool.fyToken())), address(pool), a);         return pool.sellFYToken(msg.sender, pool.sellFYTokenPreview(a));     }      /// @notice buys the underlying for the PT via the pool     /// @param u address of the underlying asset     /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market     /// @param a amount of underlying tokens to sell     /// @return uint128 amount of PT received     function buyPrincipalToken(         address u,         uint256 m,         uint128 a     ) external returns (uint128) {         IPool pool = IPool(pools[u][m]);         Safe.transfer(IERC20(address(pool.base())), address(pool), a);         return pool.buyFYToken(msg.sender, pool.buyFYTokenPreview(a), a);     }      /// @notice sells the underlying for the PT via the pool     /// @param u address of the underlying asset     /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market     /// @param a amount of underlying to swap     /// @return uint128 amount of underlying sold     function sellUnderlying(         address u,         uint256 m,         uint128 a     ) external returns (uint128) {         IPool pool = IPool(pools[u][m]);         Safe.transfer(IERC20(address(pool.base())), address(pool), a);         return pool.sellBase(msg.sender, pool.sellBasePreview(a));     }      /// @notice buys the underlying for the PT via the pool     /// @param u address of the underlying asset     /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market     /// @param a amount of PT to swap     /// @return uint128 amount of underlying bought     function buyUnderlying(         address u,         uint256 m,         uint128 a     ) external returns (uint128) {         IPool pool = IPool(pools[u][m]);         Safe.transfer(IERC20(address(pool.fyToken())), address(pool), a);         return pool.buyBase(msg.sender, pool.buyBasePreview(a), a);     } ```  Similarly, Lender's yield does the swapping without the ability to control the slippage:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L634-L657  ```solidity     /// @notice transfers excess funds to yield pool after principal tokens have been lent out     /// @dev this method is only used by the yield, illuminate and swivel protocols     /// @param u address of an underlying asset     /// @param y the yield pool to lend to     /// @param a the amount of underlying tokens to lend     /// @param r the receiving address for PTs     /// @return uint256 the amount of tokens sent to the yield pool     function yield(         address u,         address y,         uint256 a,         address r     ) internal returns (uint256) {         // preview exact swap slippage on yield         uint128 returned = IYield(y).sellBasePreview(Cast.u128(a));          // send the remaing amount to the given yield pool         Safe.transfer(IERC20(u), y, a);          // lend out the remaining tokens in the yield pool         IYield(y).sellBase(r, returned);          return returned;     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding minimum accepted return argument to the five mentioned functions and condition execution success on it so the caller can control for the realized slippage and sustain the sandwich attacks to an extent.
