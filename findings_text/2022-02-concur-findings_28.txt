# Handle  csanuragjain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact onlyClient can deactivate a token even after deadline is passed and transfer all token balance to itself  ## Proof of Concept 1. Navigate to contract at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/Shelter.sol  2. Observe that token can only be deactivated if activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD > block.timestamp. We will bypass this  3. onlyClient activates a token X using the activate function  4. Assume Grace period is crossed such that activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp  5. Now if onlyClient calls deactivate function, it fails with "too late"  6. But onlyClient can bypass this by calling activate function again on token X which will reset the timestamp to latest in activated[_token] and hence onlyClient can now call deactivate function to disable the token and retrieve all funds present in the contract to his own address  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add below condition to activate function  ``` function activate(IERC20 _token) external override onlyClient { require(activated[_token]==0, "Already activated");         activated[_token] = block.timestamp;         savedTokens[_token] = _token.balanceOf(address(this));         emit ShelterActivated(_token);     } ```
