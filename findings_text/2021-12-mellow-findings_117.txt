# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function adminApprove intends to allow an admin to approve NFTs on behalf of users: ```solidity   function adminApprove(address newAddress, uint256 nft) external {     require(_isProtocolAdmin(_msgSender()), ExceptionsLibrary.ADMIN);     IERC721(address(this)).approve(newAddress, nft);   } ```  However, when it calls .approve, it will check the ownership again, so only the calls from admin and owner/approved will pass: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L116-L119  This makes this function ineffective.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Based on my understanding, it should call ._approve(...).
