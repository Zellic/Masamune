The impact of one user not being able to call `withdraw()` is that the owner will now never be able to call `withdrawExcessRewards()` and therefore lock not only the users rewards and deposit but also and excess rewards attributed to the owner.  Thus, one malicious user may deliberately get them selves blacklisted to prevent the owner from claiming the final rewards. Since the attacker may do this with negligible balance in their `deposit()` this attack is very cheap.  ## Proof of Concept  It is possible for `IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).transfer(receipt.owner, transferAmount);` to fail for numerous reasons. Such as if a user has been blacklisted (in certain ERC20 tokens) or if a token is paused or there is an attack and the token is stuck.  This will prevent `withdraw()` from being called.  ```solidity         for (uint i = 0; i < rewards.length; i++) {             pool.rewardsWeiClaimed[i] += rewards[i];             pool.rewardFunding[i] -= rewards[i];             uint tax = (pool.taxPerCapita * rewards[i]) / 1000;             uint transferAmount = rewards[i] - tax;             taxes[poolId][i] += tax;             success = success && IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).transfer(receipt.owner, transferAmount);         }          success = success && IERC20(pool.depositToken).transfer(receipt.owner, receipt.amountDepositedWei);         require(success, 'Token transfer failed'); ```  Since line 245 of `withdrawExcessRewards()` requires that `require(pool.totalDepositsWei == 0, 'Cannot withdraw until all deposits are withdrawn');`, if one single user is unable to withdraw then it is impossible for the owner to claim the excess rewards and they are forever stuck in the contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider allowing `withdrawExcessRewards()` to be called after a set period of time after the pool end if most users have withdrawn or some similar criteria.
