# Handle  nathaniel   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `amount` in the `Investors` struct is vague. It would be assumed to be the invested amount, however this amount decreases when the beneficiary claims. A more appropriate name could be `unclaimed_amount`. `claimable_to_send` is not appropriate name in the `claimExact()` function, as it is not the claimable total, instead `exact_claim_to_send` would make more sense. ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L24 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L155
