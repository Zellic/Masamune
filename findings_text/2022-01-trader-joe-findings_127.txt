# Handle  kirk-baird   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Note: this attack requires `rJoe` to relinquish control during `tranfer()` which under the current [RocketJoeToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeToken.sol) it does not. Thus this vulnerability is raised as medium rather than high. Although it's not exploitable currently, it is a highly risky code pattern that should be avoided.  This vulnerability would allow the entire rJoe balance to be drained from the contract.  ## Proof of Concept  The function [deposit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeStaking.sol#L96) would be vulnerable to reentrancy if rJoe relinquished control flow.  The following lines show the reward calculations in variable `pending`. These calculations use two state variables `user.amount` and `user.rewardDebt`. Each of these are updated after `_safeRJoeTransfer()`.  Thus if an attacker was able to get control flow during the `rJoe::tranfer()` function they would be able to reenter `deposit()` and the value calculated for `pending`would be the same as the previous iteration hence they would again be transferred `pending` rJoe tokens. During the rJoe transfer the would again gain control of the execution and call `deposit()` again. The process could be repeated until the entire rJoe balance of the contract has been transferred to the attacker.  ```solidity         if (user.amount > 0) {             uint256 pending = (user.amount * accRJoePerShare) /                 PRECISION -                 user.rewardDebt;             _safeRJoeTransfer(msg.sender, pending);         }         user.amount = user.amount + _amount;         user.rewardDebt = (user.amount * accRJoePerShare) / PRECISION; ```   ## Tools Used  n/a  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are two possible mitigations. First is to use the [openzeppelin reentrancy guard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) over the `deposit()` function which will prevent multiple deposits being made simultaneously.  The second mitigation is to follow the [checks-effects-interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) pattern. This would involve updating all state variables before making any external calls.
