# Handle  loop   # Vulnerability details  `AirDropDistribution.sol` and `InvestorDistribution.sol` import the `safeERC20` library but make use of the normal ERC20 `transfer` function rather than `safeTransfer`. Considering this is called on the BOOT token there is likely no need for it to be `safeTransfer`. However, since the library is not used there is no need for it to be imported.   ## Proof of Concept - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L12 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L12  Transfer calls: - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L542 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L567  - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L132 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L156 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L207
