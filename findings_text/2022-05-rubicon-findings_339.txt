Based on context and comments, when the market is closed, offers can only be cancelled (offer and buy will throw).   However, in the current implementation, `isClosed()` always returns `false`, so the checks on whether the market is closed will always pass. (E.g: `can_offer()`, `can_buy()`, etc)  And there is a storage variable called `stopped`, but it's never been used, which seems should be used for `isClosed`.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity     function isClosed() public pure returns (bool closed) {         return stopped;     } ```
