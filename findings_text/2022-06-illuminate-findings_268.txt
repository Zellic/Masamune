The issue is caused by the incorrect implementation of `redeem`: ``` uint256 amount = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(lender); Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount); ``` The first line correctly calculates the balance of PT token available in `Lender`. However, the second line tries to transfer the underlying token `u` instead of `principal` from Lender to `Redeemer`. Therefore, the redeeming process will always fail as both `APWine.withdraw` and `ITempus.redeemToBacking` will try to redeem non-existent PT.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Fix the transfer line: ``` Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), lender, address(this), amount); ```
