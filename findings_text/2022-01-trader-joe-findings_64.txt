# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  During the code review, It has been observed that the token can be same as WAVAX. The initialize function should not allow if token is equals to wavax. That would affect all asset management.   ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following contract.  ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L219  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L411  ```  ## Tools Used  Code Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  On the Launchevent, token should not be equal to wavax.
