The result is an attacker may front-run any `createSplit()` transaction in the mem pool and create another `createSplit()` transaction with a higher gas price that uses the same `merkleRoot` but changes the other fields such as the `_collectionContract` or `_splitAsset()`.  The original transaction will revert and the user will not be able to send any more transaction with this `merkleRoot`.  The user would therefore have to generate a new merkle tree with different address, different allocations or a different order of leaves in the tree to create a new merkle root. However, the attack is repeateable and there is no guarantee this new merkle root will be successfully added to a split without the attacker front-running the transaction again.  ## Proof of Concept  The excerpt from `createSplitProxy()` shows the `merkleRoot()` being used as a `salt`.  ```   splitProxy = address(     new SplitProxy{salt: keccak256(abi.encode(merkleRoot))}()   ); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As seems to be the case here if the transaction address does NOT need to be known ahead of time consider removing the `salt` parameter from the contract deployment.  Otherwise, if the transaction address does need to be known ahead of time then consider concatenating `msg.sender` to the `merkleRoot`. e.g.  ``` splitProxy = address(     new SplitProxy{salt: keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, merkleRoot))}()   ) ```
