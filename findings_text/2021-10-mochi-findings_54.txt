# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Auction struct in DutchAuctionLiquidator.sol can be optimized to reduce 2 storage slot  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/liquidator/DutchAuctionLiquidator.sol L18-L25: the struct can changed into struct Auction {         uint256 nftId;         address vault;         uint48 startedAt;         uint48 boughtAt;         uint256 collateral;         uint256 debt;     } startedAt and boughtAt store block numbers, and 2^48 is be enough for a very long time.  ## Tools Used None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the struct as suggested above, also need to cast whenever startedAt and boughtAt is used.
