And the active proposal can be replaced only when the proposal is executed successfully or another proposal is activated after `GRACE_PERIOD`.  But `activateProposal()` requires at least 20% endorsements [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L216-L221), so it might be impossible to activate a new proposal forever if the current active proposal involves more than 80% of total votes.   ## Proof of Concept The below scenario would be possible. 1. `Proposal 1` was submitted and activated successfully. 2. Let's assume 81% of the total votes voted for this proposal. `Yes = 47%`, `No = 34%` 3. This proposal can't be executed for [this requirement](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L268-L270) because `47% - 34% = 13% < 33%`. 4. Currently the contract contains more than 81% of total votes and users have at most 19% in total. 5. Also users can't reclaim their votes among 81% while `Proposal 1` is active. 6. So even if a user who has 1% votes submits a new proposal, it's impossible to activate because of this [require()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L216-L221). 7. So it's impossible to delete `Proposal 1` from an active proposal and there won't be other active proposal forever.   ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think we should add one more constant like `EXECUTION_EXPIRE = 2 weeks` so that voters can reclaim their votes after this period even if the proposal is active.  I am not sure we can use the current `GRACE_PERIOD` for that purpose.  So `reclaimVotes()` should be modified like below.  ``` function reclaimVotes(uint256 proposalId_) external {     uint256 userVotes = userVotesForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender];      if (userVotes == 0) {         revert CannotReclaimZeroVotes();     }      if (proposalId_ == activeProposal.proposalId) {         if (block.timestamp < activeProposal.activationTimestamp + EXECUTION_EXPIRE) //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++         {             revert CannotReclaimTokensForActiveVote();         }     }      if (tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender] == true) {         revert VotingTokensAlreadyReclaimed();     }      tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender] = true;      VOTES.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, userVotes); } ```
