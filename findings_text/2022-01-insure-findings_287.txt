# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact A division by 0 could occur  ## Proof of Concept While at some places, a check is made to make sure that `totalSupply() > 0`, it's not consistently the case, such as in the following places:  ``` contracts\CDSTemplate.sol:235:        _retVal = (vault.attributionValue(crowdPool) * _amount) / totalSupply(); contracts\CDSTemplate.sol:318:                _balance * vault.attributionValue(crowdPool) / totalSupply(); contracts\IndexTemplate.sol:216:        _retVal = (_liquidty * _amount) / totalSupply(); contracts\IndexTemplate.sol:530:            return (_balance * totalLiquidity()) / totalSupply(); contracts\PoolTemplate.sol:768:            return (_balance * originalLiquidity()) / totalSupply(); ```  At the following places, the check is indeed made: ``` contracts\IndexTemplate.sol:514:            return (totalLiquidity() * MAGIC_SCALE_1E6) / totalSupply(); contracts\PoolTemplate.sol:747:            return (originalLiquidity() * MAGIC_SCALE_1E6) / totalSupply(); ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps If this check is at least made at some places, this means that `totalSupply()` can indeed take a value of 0. Therefore, a check should always be made to prevent the div by 0
