# Handle  robee   # Vulnerability details  Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments.  Further more, using unchecked {++x} is even more gas efficient, and the gas saving accumulates every iteration and can make a real change There is no risk of overflow caused by increamenting the iteration index in for loops (the `++i` in `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i)`). But increments perform overflow checks that are not necessary in this case. These functions use not using prefix increments (`++x`) or not using the unchecked keyword:           change to prefix increment and unchecked: CreditLine.sol, _index, 484         change to prefix increment and unchecked: CreditLine.sol, _index, 661         change to prefix increment and unchecked: CreditLine.sol, _index, 735         change to prefix increment and unchecked: CreditLine.sol, index, 888         change to prefix increment and unchecked: CreditLine.sol, index, 955         change to prefix increment and unchecked: SavingsAccount.sol, i, 286         change to prefix increment and unchecked: SavingsAccount.sol, i, 464
