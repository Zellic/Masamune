# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.  Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following smart contract line.  ``` https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/gateway/L2Migrator.sol#L197  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L472 ```  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider to cache array length.
