# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `MochiProfileV0` defines liquidation and collateral factors for different asset types. For the `AssetClass.Sigma` type, the liquidation factor is _less_ than the collateral factor:  ```solidity function liquidationFactor(address _asset)     public     view     override     returns (float memory) {     AssetClass class = assetClass(_asset);     if (class == AssetClass.Sigma) { // } else if (class == AssetClass.Sigma) {         return float({numerator: 40, denominator: 100});     } }  function maxCollateralFactor(address _asset)     public     view     override     returns (float memory) {     AssetClass class = assetClass(_asset);     if (class == AssetClass.Sigma) {         return float({numerator: 45, denominator: 100});     } } ```  This means that one can take a loan of up to 45% of their collateral but then immediately gets liquidated as the liquidation factor is only 40%. There should always be a buffer between these such that taking the max loan does not immediately lead to liquidations:  > A safety buffer is maintained between max CF and LF to protect users against liquidations due to normal volatility.
