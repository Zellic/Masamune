# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L166   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `StakingRewards.recoverERC20` rightfully checks against the `stakingToken` being sweeped away. However there's no check against the `rewardsToken` which over time will sit in this contract.  This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors  ## Proof of Concept calling `StakingRewards.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this))` enables the `owner` to sweep the token  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an additional check ```         require(             tokenAddress != address(rewardsToken),             "Cannot withdraw the rewards token"         ); ```
