# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas overspending due to excessive storage reads and function calls  ## Proof of Concept  SwapUtils's removeLiquidityImbalance does multiple _xp(self) calls, which can be saved to memory when balances don't change inbetween executions https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L1415  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Now: uint256[] memory balances1 = self.balances; v.preciseA = determineA(self, _xp(self)); v.d0 = getD(_xp(self), v.preciseA); ... v.d1 = getD(_xp(self, balances1), determineA(self, _xp(self, balances1))); ... v.d2 = getD(_xp(self, balances1), determineA(self, _xp(self, balances1)));  To be: uint256[] memory balances1 = self.balances; uint256[] memory tokenPM = self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers; // doesn't change, save and reuse uint256[] memory xP = _xp(balances1, tokenPM); // We already copied self.balances, no need to reread storage v.d0 = getD(xP, determineA(self, xP)); // v.preciseA isn't used elsewhere and can be dropped ... xP = _xp(balances1, tokenPM); // balances1 was modified, recomputing v.d1 = getD(xP, determineA(self, xP)); ... xP = _xp(balances1, tokenPM); // balances1 was modified, recomputing v.d2 = getD(xP, determineA(self, xP));
