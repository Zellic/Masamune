In  the safeTransferFrom operation, it calls \_checkOnERC20Received:  ``` if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC20Event.beforeSafeTransfer)) {   require(SourceERC20().beforeSafeTransfer(account, recipient, amount, data)); } _transfer(account, recipient, amount); require(_checkOnERC20Received(account, recipient, amount, data), "ERC20: non ERC20Receiver"); if (_isEventRegistered(HolographERC20Event.afterSafeTransfer)) {   require(SourceERC20().afterSafeTransfer(account, recipient, amount, data)); } ```  The checkOnERC20Received function: ``` if (_isContract(recipient)) {   try ERC165(recipient).supportsInterface(ERC165.supportsInterface.selector) returns (bool erc165support) {     require(erc165support, "ERC20: no ERC165 support");     // we have erc165 support     if (ERC165(recipient).supportsInterface(0x534f5876)) {       // we have eip-4524 support       try ERC20Receiver(recipient).onERC20Received(address(this), account, amount, data) returns (bytes4 retv         return retval == ERC20Receiver.onERC20Received.selector;       } catch (bytes memory reason) {         if (reason.length == 0) {           revert("ERC20: non ERC20Receiver");         } else {           assembly {             revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))           }         }       }     } else {       revert("ERC20: eip-4524 not supported");     }   } catch (bytes memory reason) {     if (reason.length == 0) {       revert("ERC20: no ERC165 support");     } else {       assembly {         revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))       }     }   } } else {   return true; } ```  In essence, if the target is a contract, the enforcer requires it to fully implement EIP-4524. The problem is that [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4524) EIP is just a draft proposal, which the project cannot assume to be supported by any receiver contract, and definitely not every receiver contract.  The specs warn us: ``` ⚠️ This EIP is not recommended for general use or implementation as it is likely to change.  ```  Therefore, it is a very dangerous requirement to add in an ERC20 enforcer, and must be left to the implementation to do if it so desires.  ## Impact  ERC20s enforced by HolographERC20 are completely uncomposable. They cannot be used for almost any DeFi application, making it basically useless.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the EIP-4524 requirements altogether.
