If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.  It is my belief that this is a medium severity vulnerability due to its ability to impact core protocol functionality.  ## Proof of Concept  For the first lender to call `lend()`, if the transfer fee % of the asset token is larger than the origination fee %, the second transfer will fail in the following code:  ```             ERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);             uint256 facilitatorTake = amount * originationFeeRate / SCALAR;             ERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransfer(                 IERC721(borrowTicketContract).ownerOf(loanId),                 amount - facilitatorTake             ); ```  Example: - `originationFee = 2%` Max fee is 5% per comments - `feeOnTransfer = 3%` - `amount = 100 tokens`  - Lender transfers `amount` - `NFTLoanFacilitator` receives `97`. - `facilitatorTake = 2` - `NFTLoanFacilitator` attempts to send `100 - 2` to borrower, but only has `97`. - Execution reverts.  ### Other considerations: If the originationFee is less than or equal to the transferFee, the transfers will succeed but will be received at a loss for the borrower and lender. Specifically for the lender, it might be unwanted functionality for a lender to lend 100 and receive 97 following a successful repayment (excluding interest for this example).  ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Since the `originationFee` is calculated based on the `amount` sent by the lender, this calculation will always underflow given the example above. Instead, a potential solution would be to calculate the `originationFee` based on the requested loan amount, allowing the lender to send a greater value so that `feeOnTransfer <= originationFee`.  Oppositely, the protocol can instead calculate the amount received from the initial transfer and use this amount to calculate the `originationFee`. The issue with this option is that the borrower will receive less than the desired loan amount.
