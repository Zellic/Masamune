For example, if a certain business logic requires a successful `token.transferFrom()` call to be made with the `OperateProxy`, if the `token` is not a existing contract, the call will return `success: true` instead of `success: false` and break the caller's assumption and potentially malfunction features or even cause fund loss to users.  The qBridge exploit (January 2022) was caused by a similar issue.  As a reference, OpenZeppelin's `Address.functionCall()` will check and `require(isContract(target), "Address: call to non-contract");`  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.5.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L135  ```solidity     function functionCallWithValue(         address target,         bytes memory data,         uint256 value,         string memory errorMessage     ) internal returns (bytes memory) {         require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");         require(isContract(target), "Address: call to non-contract");          (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data);         return verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);     } ```  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.5.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L36-L42  ```solidity     function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {         // This method relies on extcodesize/address.code.length, which returns 0         // for contracts in construction, since the code is only stored at the end         // of the constructor execution.          return account.code.length > 0;     } ```  ### Recommendation  Consider adding a check and throw when the `callee` is not a contract.
