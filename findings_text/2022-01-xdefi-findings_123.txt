# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L120-L125  ```solidity=120 uint256 withdrawAmount = amountUnlocked_ - lockAmount_;  if (withdrawAmount != uint256(0)) {     // Send the excess XDEFI to the destination, if needed.

SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(XDEFI), destination_, withdrawAmount); } ``` ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity if (amountUnlocked_ > lockAmount_) {     SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(XDEFI), destination_, amountUnlocked_ - lockAmount_); } ```  - Removed a local variable: `withdrawAmount`; - Only do the arithmetic when needed: `amountUnlocked_ - lockAmount_`.
