However there is lack of zero address check and lack of 2 step address changing process for vetoer address. This might lead to Nounders losing their veto power unintentionally and open to 51% attack which can drain their entire treasury.  Refrence from Nouns DAO contest documents: https://dialectic.ch/editorial/nouns-governance-attack https://dialectic.ch/editorial/nouns-governance-attack-2  ## Proof of Concept Lack of 0-address check for vetoer address at initialize() and _setVetoer() of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol and NounsDAOLogicV1.sol. Also it is better to make changing address process of vetoer at _setVetoer() into 2-step process to avoid accidently setting vetoer to zero address or any other arbitrary addresses and end up burning/losing veto power unintentionally.  1. vetoer address of initialize() of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol, NounsDAOLogicV1.sol https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L156 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV1.sol#L150  2. vetoer address of _setVetoer() of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol, NounsDAOLogicV1.sol https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L839-L845 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV1.sol#L637-L643  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add zero address check for vetoer address at initialize(). Also change _setVetoer() vetoer address changing process to 2-step process like explained below.  First make the _setVetoer() function approve a new vetoer address as a pending vetoer. Next that pending vetoer has to claim the ownership in a separate transaction to be a new vetoer.
