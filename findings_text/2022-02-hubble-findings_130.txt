AMM 1 has a nextFundingTime of now. AMM 2 has a nextFundingTime in 30 minutes. AMM 1 won't be able to be updated until after AMM 2's nextFundingTime elapses.  # Mitigation You shouldn't revert at the place mentioned in the links to affected code. Just return so that the other AMMs can still get updated.
