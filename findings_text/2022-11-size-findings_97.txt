And the earliest bid will be used first for the same `quotePerBase` but this ratio is not strict enough so that the worse bid might be filled than the better one.  As a result, the seller might receive fewer quote token than he wants.  ## Proof of Concept This is the test to show the scenario.  ```solidity     function testAuditWrongSorting() public {         // this test will show that it is possible the seller can not claim the best bid because of the inaccurate comparison in finalization         uint128 K = 1<<64;         baseToSell = K + 2;         uint256 aid = seller.createAuction(             baseToSell, reserveQuotePerBase, minimumBidQuote, startTime, endTime, unlockTime, unlockEnd, cliffPercent         );          bidder1.setAuctionId(aid);         bidder1.bidOnAuctionWithSalt(K+1, K, "Worse bidder");         bidder2.setAuctionId(aid);         bidder2.bidOnAuctionWithSalt(K+2, K+1, "Better bidder"); // This is the better bid because (K+1)/(K+2) > K/(K+1)          vm.warp(endTime);          uint256[] memory bidIndices = new uint[](2);         bidIndices[0] = 1; // the seller is smart enough to choose the correct order to (1, 0)         bidIndices[1] = 0;          vm.expectRevert(ISizeSealed.InvalidSorting.selector);         seller.finalize(bidIndices, K+2, K+1); // this reverts because of #273          // next the seller is forced to call the finalize with parameter K+1, K preferring the first bidder         bidIndices[0] = 0;         bidIndices[1] = 1;         seller.finalize(bidIndices, K+1, K);          // at this point the seller gets K quote tokens while he could get K+1 quote tokens with the better bidder         assertEq(quoteToken.balanceOf(address(seller)), K);     } ```  This is the output of the test.  ```solidity     Running 1 test for src/test/SizeSealed.t.sol:SizeSealedTest     [PASS] testAuditWrongSorting() (gas: 984991)     Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 7.22ms ```  When it calculates the [quotePerBase](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-size/blob/706a77e585d0852eae6ba0dca73dc73eb37f8fb6/src/SizeSealed.sol#L269), they are same each other with `(base, quote) = (K+1, K) and (K+2, K+1) when K = 1<<64`.  So the seller can receive `K+1` of the quote token but he got `K`.  I think `K` is realistic enough with the 18 decimals token because K is around 18 * 1e18.  ## Tools Used Foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps As we can see from the test, it's not strict enough to compare bidders using `quotePerBase`.  We can compare them by multiplying them like below.  $\frac {quote1}{base1} >= \frac{quote2}{base2} <=> quote1 * base2 >= quote2 * base1 $  So we can add 2 elements to `FinalizeData` struct and modify [this comparison](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-size/blob/706a77e585d0852eae6ba0dca73dc73eb37f8fb6/src/SizeSealed.sol#L269-L277) like below.  ```solidity     struct FinalizeData {         uint256 reserveQuotePerBase;         uint128 totalBaseAmount;         uint128 filledBase;         uint256 previousQuotePerBase;         uint256 previousIndex;         uint128 previousQuote; //++++++++++++         uint128 previousBase; //+++++++++++     } ```  ```solidity     uint256 quotePerBase = FixedPointMathLib.mulDivDown(b.quoteAmount, type(uint128).max, baseAmount);     if (quotePerBase >= data.previousQuotePerBase) {         // If last bid was the same price, make sure we filled the earliest bid first         if (quotePerBase == data.previousQuotePerBase) {             uint256 currentMult = uint256(b.quoteAmount) * data.previousBase; //mult for current bid             uint256 previousMult = uint256(data.previousQuote) * baseAmount; //mult for the previous bid              if (currentMult > previousMult) { // current bid is better                 revert InvalidSorting();                 }              if (currentMult == previousMult && data.previousIndex > bidIndex) revert InvalidSorting();         } else {             revert InvalidSorting();         }     }      ...      data.previousBase = baseAmount;     data.previousQuote = b.quoteAmount; ```
