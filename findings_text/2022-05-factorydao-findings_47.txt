This leads to wrong rewards calculations and effectively loss of funds for all pools that will be using ERC20 tokens with different decimals than `18`. Example of such a token is USDC that has 6 decimals only.  ## Proof of Concept * https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-factorydao/blob/db415804c06143d8af6880bc4cda7222e5463c0e/contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol#L169 * https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-factorydao/blob/db415804c06143d8af6880bc4cda7222e5463c0e/contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol#L282  ## Tools Used Manual Review / VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It is recommended to add support for different number of decimals than `18` by dynamically checking `decimals()` for the tokens that are part of the rewards calculations. Alternatively if such a support is not needed, new require statements should be added to `addPool` that will be checking that the number of decimals for all ERC20 tokens is `18`.
