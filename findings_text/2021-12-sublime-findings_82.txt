# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There are many instances of the value 30, usually used for exponents of base 10. Currently this integer value is used directly without a clear indication that this value relates to the decimals value, which could lead to one of these values being modified but not the other (perhaps by a typo), which is the basis for many past hacks. Coding best practices suggests using a constant integer to store this value in a way that clearly explains the purpose of this value to prevent confusion.  ## Proof of Concept The magic number 30 is found in dozens of places, including:  Pool/Repayments.sol https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Repayments.sol#L164-L165  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Repayments.sol#L190  PriceOracle.sol file https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/PriceOracle.sol#L130-L131  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/PriceOracle.sol#L88-L93   ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace the magic number 30 with a variable explaining the meaning of this value, such as: `uint8 private constant DECIMALS_EXPONENT = 30;`
