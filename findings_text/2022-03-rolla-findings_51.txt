Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed."   Therefore, transfers may fail silently.  ## Proof of Concept Please find the documentation here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions  ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check for the account's existence prior to transferring.
