# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There's a griefing attack vulnerability in the function `joinTokenSingle` in  `SingleTokenJoin.sol` as well as `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` which makes any user transaction fail with "FAILED_OUTPUT_AMOUNT".  ### Proof of Concept  The `JoinTokenStruct` argument for `joinTokenSingle` includes a field `outputAmount` to indicate the amount of tokens the user should receive after joining a basket (see line [135](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleTokenJoin.sol#L135) and [130](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleTokenJoinV2.sol#L130)).  However, this amount is compared to the contract's balance of the token and reverts if the amount is unequal.  If an attacker sends some amount of a basket's token to the contract, every call to this function will fail as long as the output token equals the attacker's token send.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Refactor the `require` statement to expect at least the `outputAmount` of tokens, i.e. `require(outputAmount >= _joinTokenStruct.outputAmount)`.
