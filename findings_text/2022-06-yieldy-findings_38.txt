Append dummy data:  - `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001')` - `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002')` - `addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003')` - `getAddresses()` => `address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`  Remove address: - `removeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002)` (or `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`) - `getAddresses()` => `address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`  Service is denied because it will try to call `canBatchContracts`  to `address(0)`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - To remove an entry in an array you have to use `pop` and move the last element to the removed entry position.
