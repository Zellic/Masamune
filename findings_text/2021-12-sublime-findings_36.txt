# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  uint256 variable are initialized to a default value of zero per Solidity docs: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#default-value   Setting a variable to the default value is unnecessary. Removing lines of code where variables are initialized to zero can save gas. Here are a few articles describing this gas optimization: https://blog.polymath.network/solidity-tips-and-tricks-to-save-gas-and-reduce-bytecode-size-c44580b218e6#53bd  https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-optimization-in-solidity-part-i-variables-9d5775e43dde#4135   ## Proof of Concept  - contracts/Pool/Pool.sol:358 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L358  - contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol:812 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L812   ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Instead of initializing a variable to zero, such as `uint256 abc = 0;`, the line can be shortened to `uint256 abc;` as Solidity automatically initializes uint variables to zero.
