# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function setUnstakeWindow and setCooldown don't check that the input parameter isn't 0. So the values could accidentally be set to 0 (although unlikely). However you wouldn't want the to be 0 because that would allow attacks with flashloans (stake and unstake in the same transaction)  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/Gov.sol#L124  function setUnstakeWindow(uint40 _unstakeWindow) external override onlyGovMain {     require(_unstakeWindow < 25000000, 'MAX'); // ~ approximate 10 years of blocks     GovStorage.gs().unstakeWindow = _unstakeWindow;   }    function setCooldown(uint40 _period) external override onlyGovMain {     require(_period < 25000000, 'MAX'); // ~ approximate 10 years of blocks     GovStorage.gs().unstakeCooldown = _period;   }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check the input parameter of setUnstakeWindow and setCooldown isn't 0
