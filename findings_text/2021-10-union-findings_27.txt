# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There is no need to keep iterating through a loop for the full length once the condition being searched for is met.  This will save gas.  ## Proof of Concept  The loops are here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L436-L441 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L444-L449 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L479-L485 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L488-L495  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a "break" statement to the loops mentioned above. Note also that there are unnecessary default value initializations of variables associated with the loops.
