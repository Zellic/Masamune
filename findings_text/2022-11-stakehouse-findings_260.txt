These are steps that this bug happens: 1. `user1` deposit `10` ETH into the giant pool and `claimed[user1][lpTokenETH]` is `20` and `accumulatedETHPerLPShare` is `2`. 2. some time passes and `accumulatedETHPerLPShare` set to `3`. 3. `user1` unclaimed rewards are `10 * 3 - 20 = 10` ETH. 4. `user1` withdraw his `10` ETH by calling `withdrawETH(10)` and contract set `lpTokenETH` balance of `user1`  to `0` and transfer `10` ETH to user. 5. now if `user1` calls `claimRewards()` he would get `0` reward as his `lpTokenETH` balance is `0`.  so users lose their unclaimed rewards by withdrawing their funds.  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps user's unclaimed funds should be calculated and transferred before any actions that change user's balance.
