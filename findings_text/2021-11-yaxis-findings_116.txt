# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Using existing local variables instead of reading state variables will save gas by converting SLOADs to MLOADs.   ## Proof of Concept  newTransmutationPeriod can be used here instead of TRANSMUTATION_PERIOD : https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/146febcb61ae7fe20b0920849c4f4bbe111c6ba7/contracts/v3/alchemix/Transmuter.sol#L194  TRANSMUTATION_PERIOD is named like a constant when it is actually an updatable state variable.  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use the local variable instead of the state variable. Rename TRANSMUTATION_PERIOD appropriately.
