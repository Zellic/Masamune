# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The executioner is designed to handle only ERC20-ERC20 token trades by modules. The balancer V2 vault is able to [automatically unwrap the wrapped native token](https://dev.balancer.fi/helpers/using-native-eth#overview). Hence, it is recommended to ensure that the `tokenOut` parameter passed into the `swap()` function is not the sentinel value.  The [sentinel value used is the null address.](https://dev.balancer.fi/helpers/using-native-eth#sentinel-value)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding the following check in the function.  `require(tokenOut != address(0), 'native token swap not supported');`
