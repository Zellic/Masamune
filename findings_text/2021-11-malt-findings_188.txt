# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `purchaseArbitrageTokens` enables users to commit collateral tokens and in return receive arbitrage tokens which are redeemable in the future for Malt tokens. Each auction specifies a commitment cap which when reached, prevents users from participating in the auction. However, `realCommitment` can be ignored by directly sending the `LiquidityExtension` contract collateral tokens and subsequently calling `purchaseArbitrageTokens`.  ## Proof of Concept  Consider the following scenario: - An auction is currently active. - A user sends collateral tokens to the `LiquidityExtension` contract. - The same user calls `purchaseArbitrageTokens` with amount `0`. - The `purchaseAndBurn` call returns a positive `purchased` amount which is subsequently used in auction calculations.  As a result, a user could effectively influence the average malt price used throughout the `Auction` contract.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L177-L214 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/LiquidityExtension.sol#L117-L128  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding a check to ensure that `realCommitment != 0` in `purchaseArbitrageTokens`.
