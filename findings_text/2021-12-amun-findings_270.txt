# Handle  Czar102   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact To save gas it is recommended it call function internally, if possible.  ## Proof of Concept Function [`BasketFacet::getLock()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L282-L286) is defined externally and calls from [`BasketFacet::joinPool(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L148) and [`BasketFacet::exitPool(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L194) are not internal, but message calls.  The same applies to function [`BasketFacet::getCap()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L328-L330) usage in [`BasketFacet::joinPool(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L154).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider changing visibility of `BasketFacet::getLock()` to public and calling the above function internally. Alternative solution shall be implemented with `BasketFacet::getCap()`.
