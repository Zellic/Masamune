# Handle  jvaqa   # Vulnerability details  RCTreasury.addToWhitelist() will erroneously remove user from whitelist if user is already whitelisted  ## Impact  The comments state that calling addToWhitelist() should add a user to the whitelist. [1]  However, since the implementation simply flips the user's whitelist bool, if the user is already on the whitelist, then calling addToWhitelist() will actually remove them from the whitelist. [2]  Since batchAddToWhitelist() will repeatedly call addToWhitelist() with an entire array of users, it is very possible that someone could inadvertently call addToWhitelist twice for a particular user, thereby leaving them off of the whitelist. [3]   ## Proof of Concept  If a governor calls addToWhitelist() with the same user twice, the user will not be added to the whitelist, even though the comments state that they should.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change addToWhitelist to only ever flip a user's bool to true. To clarify the governor's intention, create a corresponding removeFromWhitelist and batchRemoveFromWhitelist which flip a user's bool to false, so that the governor does not accidently remove a user when intending to add them.   Change this:  isAllowed[_user] = !isAllowed[_user]; // [4]  To this:  isAllowed[_user] = true; // [4]  And add this:      /// @notice Remove a user to the whitelist     function removeFromWhitelist(address _user) public override {         IRCFactory factory = IRCFactory(factoryAddress);         require(factory.isGovernor(msgSender()), "Not authorised");         isAllowed[_user] = false;     }      /// @notice Remove multiple users from the whitelist     function batchRemoveFromWhitelist(address[] calldata _users) public override {         for (uint256 index = 0; index < _users.length; index++) {             removeFromWhitelist(_users[index]);         }     }   [1] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L209  [2] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L213  [3] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L217  [4] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L213
