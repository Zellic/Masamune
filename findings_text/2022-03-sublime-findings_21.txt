Note that this comes with the assumption that `terminate()` is only called when the credit line is `ACTIVE` or `EXPIRED` (consider ensuring this condition on-chain), because `_sharesHeld` **excludes principal withdrawals,** so the function will fail once a lender withdraws his principal.  ```jsx function terminate(uint256 _id, address _to) external override onlyPooledCreditLine nonReentrant {   address _strategy = pooledCLConstants[_id].borrowAssetStrategy;   address _borrowAsset = pooledCLConstants[_id].borrowAsset;   uint256 _sharesHeld = pooledCLVariables[_id].sharesHeld;    SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.withdrawShares(_borrowAsset, _strategy, _to, _sharesHeld, false);   delete pooledCLConstants[_id];   delete pooledCLVariables[_id]; } ```
