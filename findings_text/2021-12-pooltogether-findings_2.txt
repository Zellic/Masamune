# Handle  johnnycash   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `_getPromotion()` doesn't revert if the specified `_promotionId` doesn't exist. It can lead to unexpected behaviors in callers of this function.  For instance, [claimRewards](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/ceadb25844f95f19f33cb856222e461ed8edf005/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L162) will continue its execution and call `_calculateRewardAmount()` and eventually `_promotion.token.safeTransfer()` (probably with `_rewardsAmount` equal to 0).   ## Analysis  In contrary to the following comment:  ``` @dev Will revert if the promotion does not exist. ```  [_getPromotion()](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/ceadb25844f95f19f33cb856222e461ed8edf005/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L260-L268) doesn't revert if the specified `_promotionId` doesn't exist, but return a `Promotion` structure with all fields set to 0.   ## Tools Used  Text editor.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix suggestion:  ```     function _getPromotion(uint256 _promotionId) internal view returns (Promotion memory _promotion) {         _promotion = _promotions[_promotionId];         require(_promotion.creator != address(0), "TwabRewards/invalid-promotion");         return _promotion;     } ```
