# Handle  natus   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact    This function calls revenueArray from storage when setting 'n' and then twice every loop (revenueArray[i] && revenueArray[i - 1]) and then again after the loop once.       If this was instead called once at the start and stored in memory; iterated and then assigned into the storage at the end; could save some gas       ## Proof of Concept   SYNTHVAULT lines #249 to #255     https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthVault.sol#L249       ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Step1: Above line #249; add in:   uint [] memory _revArray = revenueArray  (Get the storage revenueArray and store it in memory)      Step2: change revenueArray.length to _revArray.length  (maybe even remove this memory variable and just call the length directly in the loop conditions in place of 'n'?)     Step3: change:   revenueArray[i] = revenueArray[i - 1]   to:   _revArray[i] = _revArray[i - 1]      Step4: change:   revenueArray[0] = _fee   To:   _revArray[0] = _fee      Step5: add:   revenueArray = _revArray  as the final line inside the function
