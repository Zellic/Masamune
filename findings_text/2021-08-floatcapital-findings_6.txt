# Handle   hickuphh3  # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  In `_calculateFloatPerSecond()`, the edge cases where full rewards go to either the long or short token returns  `return (1e18 * k * longPrice, 0);` and  `return (0, 1e18 * k * shortPrice);` respectively.   This is however `1e18` times too large. We can verify this by checking the equivalent calculation in the 'normal case', where we assume all the rewards go to the short token, ie. `longRewardUnscaled = 0`  and `shortRewardUnscaled = 1e18`. Plugging this into the calculation below,  `return ((longRewardUnscaled * k * longPrice) / 1e18, (shortRewardUnscaled * k * shortPrice) / 1e18);` results in  `(0, 1e18 * k * shortPrice / 1e18)` or `(0, k * shortPrice)`.  As we can see, this would result in an extremely large float token issuance rate, which would be disastrous.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  The edge cases should return `(k * longPrice, 0)` and `(0, k * shortPrice)` in the cases where rewards should go fully to long and short token holders respectively.
