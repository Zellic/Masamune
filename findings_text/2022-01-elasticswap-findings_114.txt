# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The Exchange.sol constructor has a natspec comment which is missing the _exchangeFactoryAddress function parameter. Issues with comments are low risk based on [Code4rena risk categories](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/judging-criteria#estimating-risk-tl-dr).  ## Proof of Concept  [Exchange.sol line 62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/contracts/Exchange.sol#L58-L68) is missing a comment indicating the _exchangeFactoryAddress input parameter is required.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Make sure natspec comments include all parameters and add one for the _exchangeFactoryAddress parameter.
