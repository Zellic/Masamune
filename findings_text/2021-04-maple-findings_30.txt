# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Lockers are critical contracts that hold custody of different Maple assets. While there are five lockers created initially (as described in https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/wiki/Lockers), such new lockers created by the factory should be logged as events for off-chain monitoring, similar to whats done in StakeLocker. However, such an event emission is missing here.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/FundingLockerFactory.sol#L21-L26  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Create and emit a suitable event to log locker creation.
