# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `OverlayV1UniswapV3Market` contract assumes that one of the tokens of `_ovlFeed` is ETH but does not check it in the constructor:  ```solidity constructor(     address _mothership,     address _ovlFeed,     address _marketFeed,     address _quote,     address _eth,     uint128 _baseAmount,     uint256 _macroWindow,     uint256 _microWindow,     uint256 _priceFrameCap ) OverlayV1Market (     _mothership ) OverlayV1Comptroller (     _microWindow ) OverlayV1OI (     _microWindow ) OverlayV1PricePoint (     _priceFrameCap ) {      // immutables     eth = _eth;     // could be that token1 is not ETH either     ethIs0 = IUniswapV3Pool(_ovlFeed).token0() == _eth;     // ... } ```  ## Impact If `token0` is _not_ ETH, then it assumes `token1` is ETH but never validates this assumption. This could lead to wrong market liquidity and prices calculations if an `_ovlFeed` is supplied that is not actually the OVL/ETH feed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check that `(token0 == OVL && token1 == WETH) || (token1 == OVL && token0 == WETH)` for `_ovlFeed`.
