For example: ``` function cash(address _vault, bytes32[] calldata _burnProof) external {     // Reverts if vault is not registered     (address token, uint256 id) = _verifyVault(_vault);     // Reverts if active listing has not been settled     Listing storage activeListing = activeListings[_vault];     // Reverts if listing has not been sold     if (!_verifySale(_vault)) {         revert NotSold();     } else if (activeListing.collateral != 0) {         uint256 collateral = activeListing.collateral;         activeListing.collateral = 0;         // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal         pendingBalances[_vault][activeListing.proposer] = collateral;     }  ... ```  pendingBalances is not guaranteed to be zero. There could be funds from previous proposals which are not yet collected. Propose updates pendingBalance correctly: ``` // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral; ```  So, when propose is followed by another propose(), the pendingBalance is updated correctly, but in cash and list we don't account for pre-existing balance. This issue would manifest even after the fix suggested in the issue "User can send a proposal and instantly take back their collateral" because reject functions would increment the pendingBalance and then it would be overriden.  ## Impact  User loses collateral converted to pendingBalance when cash() or list() is called  ## Proof of Concept  1. User calls propose() and gets pendingBalance = x 2. User calls propose() with an improved proposal and gets pendingBalance = 1.5x 3. proposal is successfull and the listing purchased the NFT 4. cash() is called to convert the Raes to ETH amount from the sell. pendingBalance is overridden by the current "collateral"  value. pendingBalance = 0.5x 5. User loses x collateral value which is stuck in the contract  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change the = operator to += in list() and cash().
