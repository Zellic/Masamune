# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Hardcoded constants in code is risky for auditability/readability/maintainability. The Factory contract uses 2e17 as a threshold check for ownerSplit instead of using a contract constant as done in other places.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L56  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Create a contract constant and use that as done in other places.
