It consist the following logic:  ``` /// @dev Creates an auction for the next token function _createAuction() private {     // Get the next token available for bidding     try token.mint() returns (uint256 tokenId) {         **creating of the auction for token with id equal to tokenId**          // Pause the contract if token minting failed     } catch Error(string memory) {         _pause();     } } ```  According to the [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md) `call` opcode can consume as most `63/64` of parrent calls' gas. That means `token.mint()` can fail since there will be no gas.   All in all, if `token.mint()` fail on gas and the rest gas is enough for pausing the contract by calling `_pause` in `catch` statement the contract will be paused.  Please note, that a bug can be exploitable if the token.mint() consume more than 1.500.000 of gas, because 1.500.000 / 64 > 20.000 that need to pause the contract. Also, the logic of `token.mint()` includes traversing the array up to 100 times, that's heavy enough to reach 1.500.000 gas limit.   ## Impact  Contract can be paused by any user by passing special amount of gas for the call of `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` (which consists of two internal calls of `_settleAuction` and `_createAuction` functions).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a special check for upper bound of `gasLeft` at start of `_createAuction` function.
