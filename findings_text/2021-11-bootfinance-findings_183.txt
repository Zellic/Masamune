# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact CustomPrecisionMultipliers are set in the constructor: ```solidity         customPrecisionMultipliers[0] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_targetPrice).div(10 ** 18); ``` `originalPrecisionMultipliers` equal to 1 if the token's decimal = 18. The targe price could only be an integer.  If the target price is bigger than 10**18, the user can deposit and trade in the pool. Though, the functionality would be far from the spec.  If the target price is set to be smaller than 10**18, the pool would be broken and all funds would be stuck.  I consider this is a high-risk issue.   ## Proof of Concept Please refer to the implementation. [Swap.sol#L184-L187](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/Swap.sol#L184-L187)  We can also trigger the bug by setting a pool with target price = 0.5. (0.5 * 10**18) ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I recommend providing extra 10**18 in both multipliers. ```solidity         customPrecisionMultipliers[0] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_targetPrice).mul(10**18).div(10 ** 18);         customPrecisionMultipliers[1] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[1].mul(10**18); ``` The customswap only supports two tokens in a pool, there's should be enough space. Recommend the devs to go through the trade-off saddle finance has paid to support multiple tokens. The code could be more clean and efficient if the pools' not support multiple tokens.
