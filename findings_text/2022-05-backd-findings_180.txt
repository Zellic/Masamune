This was used to prevent reentrancy.   However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to proceess the transaction A good article about that https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Used call instead.  For example          (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{amount}("");         require(success, "Transfer failed.");
