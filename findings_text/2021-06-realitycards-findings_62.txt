# Handle  jvaqa   # Vulnerability details  Redundant require() statement in RCFactory.createMarket()  ## Impact  RCFactory.createMarket() contains two require() statements side-by-side both checking the value of the relative values of _timestamps[0] and block.timestamp. // [1]  However, there is no case where the first require() statement would be triggered without the second require() statement also being triggered, since advancedWarning cannot have a negative value. // [2]  Thus, the first require() statement is redundant, and unnecessarily uses gas.  ## Proof of Concept  Alice can call RCFactory.createMarket() with an advancedWarning value greater than zero, and a _timestamps[0] value less than block.timestamp.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove this require statement:  require(                 _timestamps[0] >= block.timestamp,                 "Market opening time not set"             ); // [3]   [1] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L520  [2] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L524  [3] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L520
