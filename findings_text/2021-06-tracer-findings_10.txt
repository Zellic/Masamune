# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The constructor of Insurance.so does an emit. However the constructors of the other contracts (InsurancePoolToken.sol, Liquidation.sol, Pricing.sol, TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol, TracerPerpetualsFactory.sol, Trader.sol) don't do an emit in the constructor.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L31 constructor(address _tracer) {      ...         emit InsurancePoolDeployed(_tracer, tracer.tracerQuoteToken());     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Perhaps it's useful for other constructor to also include an emit
