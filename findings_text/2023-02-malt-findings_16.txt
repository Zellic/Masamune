It keeps track of total profit swing traders maded during `sellMalt()`. However, the logic for accounting it is wrong so it will not have the correct value. As the results, it can affect other contracts that integrating with `SwingTraderManager` and use this `totalProfit` variable.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-malt/blob/700f9b468f9cf8c9c5cffaa1eba1b8dea40503f9/contracts/StabilityPod/SwingTraderManager.sol#L252-L258  ```solidity if (amountSold + dustThreshold >= maxAmount) {   return maxAmount; }  totalProfit += profit;  // @audit did not update because already return above  emit SellMalt(amountSold, profit); ```  Function `sellMalt()` has a dust check before returning result. `totalProfit` should be updated before this check as it return the value immediately without updating `totalProfit`.   ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Updating `totalProfit` before the dust check in function `sellMalt()`.
