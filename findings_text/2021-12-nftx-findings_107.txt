# Handle  p4st13r4   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Any user that owns a vToken of a particular vault can lock the functionalities of `NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol` and `NFTXStakingZap.sol` for everyone.  Every operation performed by the marketplace, that deals with vToken minting, performs this check:  ```jsx require(balance == IERC20Upgradeable(vault).balanceOf(address(this)), "Did not receive expected balance"); ```  A malicious user could transfer any amount > 0 of a vault’vToken to the marketplace (or staking) zap contracts, thus making the vault functionality unavailable for every user on the marketplace  ## Proof of Concept  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L421](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L421)  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L421](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L421)  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove this logic from the marketplace and staking zap contracts, and add it to the vaults (if necessary)
