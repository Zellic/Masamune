As a result, users can receive more funds than their upper limit from the protocol.  ## Proof of Concept As we can see from the [documentation](https://docs.tigris.trade/protocol/trading-and-fees#limitations), there is limitation of a maximum PnL.  ``` Maximum PnL is +500%. The trade won't be closed unless the user sets a Take Profit order or closes the position manually. ```  And this logic was implemented like below in `_closePosition()`.  ```solidity File: 2022-12-tigris\contracts\Trading.sol 624:                 _toMint = _handleCloseFees(_trade.asset, uint256(_payout)*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.tigAsset, _positionSize*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.trader, _isBot); 625:                 if (maxWinPercent > 0 && _toMint > _trade.margin*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT) { //@audit bypass limit 626:                     _toMint = _trade.margin*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT; 627:                 } ```  But it checks the `maxWinPercent` between the partial payout and full margin so the below scenario is possible.  1. Alice opened an order of margin = 100 and PnL = 1000 after taking closing fees. 2. If `maxWinPercent` = 500%, Alice should receive 500 at most. 3. But Alice closed 50% of the position and she got 500 for a 50% margin because it checks `maxWinPercent` with `_toMint = 500` and `_trade.margin = 100` 4. After she closed 50% of the position, the remaining margin = 50 and PnL = 500 so she can continue step 3 again and again. 5. As a result, she can withdraw almost 100% of the initial PnL(1000) even though she should receive at most 500.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We should check the `maxWinPercent` between the partial payout and partial margin like below.  ```solidity     _toMint = _handleCloseFees(_trade.asset, uint256(_payout)*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.tigAsset, _positionSize*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.trader, _isBot);      uint256 partialMarginToClose = _trade.margin * _percent / DIVISION_CONSTANT; //+++++++++++++++++++++++     if (maxWinPercent > 0 && _toMint > partialMarginToClose*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT) {          _toMint = partialMarginToClose*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT;     } ```
