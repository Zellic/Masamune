# Handle  egjlmn1   # Vulnerability details  in all of your for loops, you increase your loop variable using `i++` it has 2 problems: 1. postfix increment is more wasteful than prefix increment (`++i` instead of `i++`) 2. there is no risk for overflow, so you can use `unchecked{}`  ## Impact prefix arithmetic is a bit cheaper than postfix arithmetic, but if you do it in a for loop, this small amount of gas can pile up and be a big waste. also, in solidity 0.8.0+, every arithmetic operation is checked for overflow and underflow, which adds a lot of gas to a single operation. Since in your for loop you don't have the risk for overflow, you can surround the operation in `unchecked{}` to save a lot of gas (which will save a huge amount since it saves a lot in a single loop iteration.)  ## Proof of Concept Checked on remix  ## Tools Used manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps change every `i++` in your for loops to `unchecked{++i}`
