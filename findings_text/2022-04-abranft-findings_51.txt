But, by setting the `ltvBPS` value to `0` they are able to seize the collateral.  If `ltvBPS` is `0` the following require statement in `removeCollateral()` will always be true:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-abranft/blob/main/contracts/NFTPairWithOracle.sol#L288  `rate * 0 / BPS < amount` is always `true`.  That allows the lender to seize the collateral although its value didn't decrease nor did the time to repay the loan come.  So the required steps are: 1. lend the funds to the borrower 2. call `updateLoanParams()` to set the `ltvBPS` value to `0` 3. call `removeCollateral()` to steal the collateral from the contract  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Don't allow `updateLoanParams()` to change the `ltvBPS` value.
