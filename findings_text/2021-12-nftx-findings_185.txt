# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `transferFromERC721(address assetAddr, uint256 tokenId, address to)` should transfer from `msg.sender` to `to`. It transfers to `address(this)` instead when ERC721 is Cryptokitties. As there is no additional logic for this case it seems to be a mistake that leads to wrong NFT accounting after such a transfer as NFT will be missed in the vault (which is `to`).  ## Proof of Concept  NFTXStakingZap: transferFromERC721 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L416  NFTXMarketplaceZap: transferFromERC721 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L556  Both functions are called by user facing Marketplace buy/sell and Staking addLiquidity/provideInventory functions.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix the address:  Now: ``` // Cryptokitties. data = abi.encodeWithSignature("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)", msg.sender, address(this), tokenId); ```  To be: ``` // Cryptokitties. data = abi.encodeWithSignature("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)", msg.sender, to, tokenId); ```
