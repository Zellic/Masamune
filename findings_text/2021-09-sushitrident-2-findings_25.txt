# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  # range fee growth underflow ## Impact The function `RangeFeeGrowth` [ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L601-L633](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L601-L633) would revert the transaction in some cases.  When a pool cross a tick, it only updates either `feeGrowthOutside0` or `feeGrowthOutside1`. [Ticks.sol#L23-L53](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/libraries/concentratedPool/Ticks.sol#L23-L53)  `RangeFeeGrowth` calculates the fee as follow: ```solidity             feeGrowthInside0 = _feeGrowthGlobal0 - feeGrowthBelow0 - feeGrowthAbove0;             feeGrowthInside1 = _feeGrowthGlobal1 - feeGrowthBelow1 - feeGrowthAbove1; ```  `feeGrowthBelow + feeGrowthAbove` is not necessary smaller than `_feeGrowthGlobal`. Please see `POC`.   Users can not provide liquidity or burn liquidity. Fund will get stocked in the contract. I consider this is a high-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept ```python     # This is the wrapper.     # def add_liquidity(pool, amount, lower, upper)     # def swap(pool, buy, amount)      add_liquidity(pool, deposit_amount, -800, 500)     add_liquidity(pool, deposit_amount, 400, 700)     # We cross the tick here to trigger the bug.      swap(pool, False, deposit_amount)     # Only tick 700's feeGrowthOutside1 is updated      swap(pool, True, deposit_amount)     # Only tick 500's feeGrowthOutside0 is updated          # current tick at -800      # this would revert     # feeGrowthBelow1 = feeGrowthGlobal1     # feeGrowthGlobal1 - feeGrowthBelow1 - feeGrowthAbove1 would revert     # user would not be able to mint/withdraw/cross this tick. The pool is broken     add_liquidity(pool, deposit_amount, 400, 700) ``` ## Tools Used Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It's either modify the tick's algo or `RangeFeeGrowth`. The quick-fix I come up with is to deal with the fee in `RangeFeeGrowth`. However, I recommend the team to go through tick's logic again.
