# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function fulfill treats txData.expiry = block.timestamp as expired tx:     // Make sure the expiry has not elapsed     require(txData.expiry > block.timestamp, "fulfill: EXPIRED");  However, function cancel has an inclusive check for the same condition:     if (txData.expiry >= block.timestamp) {     // Timeout has not expired and tx may only be cancelled by router  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Unify that to make the code coherent. Probably txData.expiry = block.timestamp should be treated as expired everywhere.
