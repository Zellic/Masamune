In one condition, this is not true. Namely, when we have `pool.success == false` and `block.timestamp == pool.terminationPeriod`, this check within `_verifyUnsuccessfulState` is `false`: ```solidity if (pool.success || block.timestamp > pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState(); ``` Similarly, this check within `_verifySuccessfulState` is also `false`: ```solidity if (!pool.success && block.timestamp < pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState(); ``` Because this breaks a fundamental invariant of the contract, there are probably multiple ways to exploit it.  One way an attacker can exploit is by calling `claim` (to get his contribution back completely), bidding again with a higher value than his previous contributions (to get his contributions back again).  ## Proof Of Concept Let's assume we are at timestamp `pool.terminationPeriod`. Attacker Charlie has performed the lowest bid with quantity 10 and price 1 ETH. He calls `claim` to get his 10 ETH back. Now, he calls `contribute` with a quantity of 10 and a price of 2 ETH. Because this bid is higher than his previous one (which was the lowest one), his `pendingBalances` is set to 10 ETH (for the deleted entries) and his `userContributions` is set to 20 ETH (for this new contribution). He can now call `claim` again to get back his 20 ETH in `userContributions`, but also the 10 ETH in `pendingBalances`. Like that, he has stolen 10 ETH (and could use this attack pattern to drain the whole contract).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change `<` in `_verifySuccessfulState` to `<=`.
