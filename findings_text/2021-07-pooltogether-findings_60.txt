# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `_requireYieldSource` function performs a low-level status code and parses the return data even if the call failed as it does not check the first return value (`success`). It could be the case that non-zero data is returned even though the call failed, and the function would return `true`.  Check the return value or perform a high-level call using the `_yieldSource` interface.
