# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  At line 213 of `ATokenYieldSource`, `depositToken()` can be replaced by `_tokenAddress()` to save gas since the former is a public function, while the latter is an internal function.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [ATokenYieldSource.sol#L213](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/ATokenYieldSource.sol#L213)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change `depositToken()` to `_tokenAddress()`.
