# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function of `ConcentratedLiquidityPool` explicitly converts the result of `DyDxMath.getDy` and `DyDxMath.getDx` from type `uint256` to type `uint128`. The explicit casting without checking whether the integer exceeds the maximum number (i.e., `type(uint128).max`) could cause incorrect results being used. Specifically, an attacker could exploit this bug to mint a large amount of liquidity but only pay a little of `token0` or `token1` to the pool and effectively steal other's funds when burning his liquidity.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Suppose that the current price is at the tick `500000`, an attacker calls the `mint` function with the following parameters:  ``` mintParams.lower = 100000 mintParams.upper = 500000 mintParams.amount1Desired = (1 << 128) + 71914955423 # a carefully chosen number mintParams.amount0Desired = 0 ```  2. Since the current price is equal to the upper price, we have  ``` _liquidity = mintParams.amount1Desired * (1 << 96) // (priceUpper - priceLower)            = 4731732988155153573010127840 ```  3. The amounts of `token0` and `token1` that the attacker has to pay is  ``` amount0Actual = 0 amount1Actual = uint128(DyDxMath.getDy(_liquidity, priceLower, priceUpper, true))               = uint128(_liquidity * (priceUpper - priceLower) // (1 << 96)) # round up               = uint128(340282366920938463463374607456141861046)             # exceed the max               = 24373649590                                                  # truncated ```  4. The attacker only pays `24373649590` of `token1` to get `4731732988155153573010127840` of the liquidity, which he could burn to get more `token1`. As a result, the attacker is stealing the funds from the pool and could potentially drain it.

If so, then revert the transaction. Or consider using the [`SafeCast` library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#SafeCast) from OpenZeppelin instead.
