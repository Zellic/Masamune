# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `circuitBreaker()` function in `RCMarket.sol` is utilised in the event an oracle never provides a response to a RealityCards question. The function makes an external call to the `RCOrderbook.sol` contract through the `closeMarket()` function. If for some reason the orderbook was unable to be closed, this would never be checked in the `circuitBreaker()` function.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L1215-L1223  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure this is intended behaviour, or otherwise validate the response of `orderbook.closeMarket()`. Another option would be to emit the result of the external call in the `LogStateChange` event, alongside the state change.
