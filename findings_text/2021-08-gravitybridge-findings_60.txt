# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  SafeMath library functions are not always used in the `Gravity` contract's arithmetic operations, which could cause integer underflow/overflows. Using SafeMath is considered a best practice that could completely prevent underflow/overflows and increase code consistency.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Gravity.sol#L202](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L202) [Gravity.sol#L586](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L586)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using the SafeMath library functions in the referenced lines of code.
