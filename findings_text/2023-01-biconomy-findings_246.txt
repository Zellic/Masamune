Due to different ways to execute transaction on the wallet there could be a collision between `batchIds` being used.  This can result in unexpected failing of transactions  ## Proof of Concept  There are two main ways to execute transaction from the smart wallet  1. Via EntryPoint - calls `execFromEntryPoint`/`execute` 2. Via `execTransaction`  `SmartAccount` has locked the `batchId` #0  to be used by the `EntryPoint`. When an `EntryPoint` calls `validateUserOp` before execution, the hardcoded nonce of `batchId` #0 will be incremented and validated, https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/53c8c3823175aeb26dee5529eeefa81240a406ba/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L501 ```     // @notice Nonce space is locked to 0 for AA transactions     // userOp could have batchId as well     function _validateAndUpdateNonce(UserOperation calldata userOp) internal override {         require(nonces[0]++ == userOp.nonce, "account: invalid nonce");     } ```  Calls to `execTransaction` are more immediate and are likely to be executed before a `UserOp` through `EntryPoint`. There is no limitation in `execTransaction` to use `batchId` #0 although it should be called only by `EntryPoint`.  If there is a call to `execTransaction` with `batchId` set to `0`. It will increment the nonce and `EntryPoint` transactions will revert. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/53c8c3823175aeb26dee5529eeefa81240a406ba/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L216 ```     function execTransaction(         Transaction memory _tx,         uint256 batchId,         FeeRefund memory refundInfo,         bytes memory signatures     ) public payable virtual override returns (bool success) { -------             nonces[batchId]++; -------         }     } ```  ## Tools Used  VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a requirement that `batchId` is not `0` in `execTransaction`:  `require(batchId != 0, "batchId 0 is used only by EntryPoint")`
