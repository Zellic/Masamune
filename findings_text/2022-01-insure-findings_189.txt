# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Underlying and index tokens are mixed up in the worth() function description, making code and its description conflicting  ## Proof of Concept  Worth() computes how many iTokens correspond to given amount of underlying. The description says otherwise, mixing them up:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L794-798    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix the description to say that ‘_value' is the amount of underlying, while the '_amount' is the corresponding output quantity of iTokens
