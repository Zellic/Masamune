# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/9684bcef06481e493d060974b1777a4517c4e792/contracts/MapleLoanInternals.sol#L257-L273  ```solidity=257     uint256 treasuryFee = (fundsLent_ * ILenderLike(lender_).treasuryFee() * _paymentInterval * _paymentsRemaining) / uint256(365 days * 10_000);      // Transfer delegate fee, if any, to the pool delegate, and decrement drawable funds.     uint256 delegateFee = (fundsLent_ * ILenderLike(lender_).investorFee() * _paymentInterval * _paymentsRemaining) / uint256(365 days * 10_000);      // Drawable funds is the amount funded, minus any fees.     _drawableFunds = fundsLent_ - treasuryFee - delegateFee;      require(         treasuryFee == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transfer(_fundsAsset, ILenderLike(lender_).mapleTreasury(), treasuryFee),         "MLI:FL:T_TRANSFER_FAILED"     );      require(         delegateFee == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transfer(_fundsAsset, ILenderLike(lender_).poolDelegate(), delegateFee),         "MLI:FL:PD_TRANSFER_FAILED"         ); ```  In the current implementation, `mapleTreasury`, `poolDelegate` and `treasuryFee` are taken from user input `lender_`, which can be faked by setting up a contract with `ILenderLike` interfaces.  This allows the attacker to set very high fees, making `_drawableFunds` near 0.  Since `mapleTreasury` and `poolDelegate` are also read from `lender_`, `treasuryFee` and `investorFee` can be retrieved back to the attacker.  As a result, the borrower won't get any `_drawableFunds` while also being unable to remove collateral.  ### PoC  Given:  - `_collateralRequired` = 10 BTC - `_principalRequested` = 1,000,000 USDC - `_paymentInterval` = 1 day - `_paymentsRemaining` = 10 - `_gracePeriod` = 1 day  1. Alice (borrower) calls `postCollateral()` and added `10 BTC` as `_collateralAsset`; 2. The attacker calls `fundLoan()` by taking `1,000,000 USDC` of flashloan and using a fake `lender`contract; 3. Alice calls `drawdownFunds()` with any amount > 0 will fail; 4. Alice calls `removeCollateral()` with any amount > 0 will get "MLI:DF:INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL" error; 5. Unless Alice make payment (which is meaningless), after 2 day, the attacker can call `repossess()` and get `10 BTC`.  ### Recommendation  Consider reading `treasuryFee`, `investorFee`, `mapleTreasury`, `poolDelegate` from an authoritative source instead.
