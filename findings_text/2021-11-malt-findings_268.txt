# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability  `AuctionEschapeHatch.sol#exitEarly` takes as input `amount` to represent how much of the   When the user exits an auction with profit, to apply the profit penalty less `maltQuantity` is liquidated compared to how much malt token the liquidated amount corresponds to. The problem is `auction.amendAccountParticipation()` simply subtracts the malt quantity with penalty and full `amount` from users auction stats. This causes a major problem, since in `_calculateMaltRequiredForExit` those values are used for calculation by calculating maltQuantity as follow:  `uint256 maltQuantity = userMaltPurchased.mul(amount).div(userCommitment);`   The ratio of `userMaltPurchased / userCommitment` gets higher after each profit taking (since penalty is applied to substracted `maltQuantity` from `userMaltPurchased`), by doing so a user can earn more than it should. Since after each profit taking users commitment corresponds to proportionally more malt, the user can even reduce profit penalties by dividing `exitEarly` calls in several calls.  In other words, the ratio of `userMaltPurchased / userCommitment` gets higher after each profit taking and user can claim more malt with less commitment. Furthermore after all `userMaltPurchased` is claimed the user can have `userCommitment` left over, which can be used to `claimArbitrage`, when possible.  ## Mitigation Step  Make sure which values are used for what and update values which doesn't create problems like this. Rethink about how to track values of an auction correctly.
