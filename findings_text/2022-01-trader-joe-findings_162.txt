# Handle  kirk-baird   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The logic in [_atPhase()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L590) can be simplified to save gas and code complexity.  The code can be simplified to the follwoing.  ```solidity     function _atPhase(Phase _phase) internal view {             require(currentPhase() == _phase, "LaunchEvent: incorrect phase");     } ```  ## Proof of Concept  n/a  ## Tools Used  n/a  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider updating the code to that procided above.
