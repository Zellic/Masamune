However, the same problem can occur for `MigrateKernel`. For instance, let's say we have a `MigrateKernel` followed by a `DeactivatePolicy` action. The `MigrateKernel` action will change the value of `kernel` within the policy. The `DeactivatePolicy` action tries to call `setActiveStatus` on the policy. However, this has a `onlyKernel` modifier and the call will therefore fail when it is done after the value of `kernel` was changed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Perform the same check for `MigrateKernel`.
