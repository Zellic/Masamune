# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `EIP1271Wallet` contract intends to allow the treasury manager account to sign off-chain orders in 0x on behalf of the `TreasuryManager` contract, which holds harvested assets/`COMP` from Notional. While the `EIP1271Wallet._validateOrder` function mostly prevents the treasury manager from exploiting these orders, it does not ensure that the `takerAddress` and `senderAddress` are set to the zero address. As a result, it is possible for the manager to have sole rights to an off-chain order and due to the flexibility in `makerPrice`, the manager is able to extract value from the treasury by maximising the allowed slippage.  By setting `takerAddress` to the zero address, any user can be the taker of an off-chain order. By setting `senderAddress` to the zero address, anyone is allowed to access the exchange methods that interact with the order, including filling the order itself. Hence, these two order addresses can be manipulated by the manager to effectively restrict order trades to themselves.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/0571244e9e84b9ad778bccb99b837dd6f9baaf6e/contracts/exchange-libs/contracts/src/LibOrder.sol#L66 ``` address takerAddress;           // Address that is allowed to fill the order. If set to 0, any address is allowed to fill the order. ```  https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/0571244e9e84b9ad778bccb99b837dd6f9baaf6e/contracts/exchange/contracts/src/MixinExchangeCore.sol#L196-L250  https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/0571244e9e84b9ad778bccb99b837dd6f9baaf6e/contracts/exchange/contracts/src/MixinExchangeCore.sol#L354-L374   https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/utils/EIP1271Wallet.sol#L147-L188 ``` function _validateOrder(bytes memory order) private view {     (         address makerToken,         address takerToken,         address feeRecipient,         uint256 makerAmount,         uint256 takerAmount     ) = _extractOrderInfo(order);      // No fee recipient allowed     require(feeRecipient == address(0), "no fee recipient allowed");      // MakerToken should never be WETH     require(makerToken != address(WETH), "maker token must not be WETH");      // TakerToken (proceeds) should always be WETH     require(takerToken == address(WETH), "taker token must be WETH");      address priceOracle = priceOracles[makerToken];      // Price oracle not defined     require(priceOracle != address(0), "price oracle not defined");      uint256 slippageLimit = slippageLimits[makerToken];      // Slippage limit not defined     require(slippageLimit != 0, "slippage limit not defined");      uint256 oraclePrice = _toUint(         AggregatorV2V3Interface(priceOracle).latestAnswer()     );      uint256 priceFloor = (oraclePrice * slippageLimit) /         SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION;      uint256 makerDecimals = 10**ERC20(makerToken).decimals();      // makerPrice = takerAmount / makerAmount     uint256 makerPrice = (takerAmount * makerDecimals) / makerAmount;      require(makerPrice >= priceFloor, "slippage is too high"); } ```  ## Tools Used  Manual code review. Discussions with Notional team.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding `require(takerAddress == address(0), "manager cannot set taker");` and `require(senderAddress == address(0), "manager cannot set sender");` statements to `_validateOrder`. This should allow any user to fill an order and prevent the manager from restricting exchange methods to themselves.
