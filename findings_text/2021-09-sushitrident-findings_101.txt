# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `HybridPool`'s reserves are stored as Bento "amounts" (not Bento shares) in `_updateReserves` because `_balance()` converts the current share balance to amount balances. However, when retrieving the `reserve0/1` storage fields in `_getReserves`, they are converted to amounts a second time.  ## Impact The `HybridPool` returns wrong reserves which affects all minting/burning and swap functions. They all return wrong results making the pool eventually economically exploitable or leading to users receiving less tokens than they should.  ## POC Imagine the current Bento amount / share price being `1.5`. The pool's Bento _share_ balance being `1000`. `_updateReserves` will store a reserve of `1.5 * 1000 = 1500`. When anyone trades using the `swap` function, `_getReserves()` is called and multiplies it by `1.5` again, leading to using a reserve of 2250 instead of 1500. A higher reserve for the output token leads to receiving more tokens as the swap output. Thus the pool lost tokens and the LPs suffer this loss.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Make sure that the reserves are in the correct amounts.
