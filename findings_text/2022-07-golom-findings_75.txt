The excess value that is sent will be permanently locked in the contract.  ## Proof of Concept  There is only one check over `msg.value` and it is that it's greater than `o.totalAmt * amount + p.paymentAmt`. As seen in the following code snippet from #217. ```solidity         require(msg.value >= o.totalAmt * amount + p.paymentAmt, 'mgmtm'); ```  The issue here is that the contract will only ever spend exactly `o.totalAmt * amount + p.paymentAmt`. Hence if `msg.value` is greater than this then the excess value will be permanently locked in the contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  To avoid this issue consider enforcing a strict equality.   ```solidity         require(msg.value == o.totalAmt * amount + p.paymentAmt, 'mgmtm'); ```
