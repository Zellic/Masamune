# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Without Event, it is difficult to identify in real-time whether correct values are recorded on the blockchain. In this case, it becomes problematic to determine whether the corresponding value has been changed in the application and whether the corresponding function has been called. setMinBorrowUSD function is missing event.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Go to following the function [setMinBorrowUSD Function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/Controller.sol#L137) 2. There is missing event definition on the function.   ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add Event corresponding to the change occurring in the function.  <code>Add `emit NewMinBorrowUSD(_value);`</code>
