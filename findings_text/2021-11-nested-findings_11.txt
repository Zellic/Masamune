# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Explanation  `updateShareholder` in `FeeSplitter.sol` can be implemented more efficiently. The updated version consumes less gas and also has the second `require` statement earlier, which reduces  the gas cost in case the statement of second `require` is not fullfilled.   `FeeSplitter.sol` : L166-174: ```     function updateShareholder(uint256 _accountIndex, uint256 _weight) external onlyOwner {         require(_accountIndex + 1 <= shareholders.length, "FeeSplitter: INVALID_ACCOUNT_INDEX");         uint256 _totalWeights = totalWeights;         _totalWeights -= shareholders[_accountIndex].weight;         shareholders[_accountIndex].weight = _weight;         _totalWeights += _weight;         require(_totalWeights > 0, "FeeSplitter: TOTAL_WEIGHTS_ZERO");         totalWeights = _totalWeights;     } ``` can be replaced with: ```     function updateShareholder(uint256 _accountIndex, uint256 _weight) external onlyOwner {         require(_accountIndex + 1 <= shareholders.length, "FeeSplitter: INVALID_ACCOUNT_INDEX");         totalWeights = totalWeights + _weight - shareholders[_accountIndex].weight;         require(_totalWeights > 0, "FeeSplitter: TOTAL_WEIGHTS_ZERO");         shareholders[_accountIndex].weight = _weight;     } ``` ## Tools Used  Manual analysis
