# Handle  heiho1   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Pool.burnSynth(address,address) is potentially a reentrant method because it executes transfers and burning before updating balances/metrics.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L245  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The function should update state before external calls.  Consider using a nonReentrant guard as provided by OpenZeppelin:  https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard
