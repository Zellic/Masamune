# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L78-L83  ```solidity=78{81} function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {     require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');     uint256 amount = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));     IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received);     received = amount; } ```  `received` is not being assigned prior to L81, therefore, at L81, `received` is `0`.  As a result, the `emergencyWithdraw()` does not work, in essence.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity=78 function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {     require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');     received = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));     IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received); } ```
