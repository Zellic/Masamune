This is possible because:  1. `receive()` has no restriction on the sender 2. `processOutputOrders()` does not check `msg.value`, and rightly so, because funds are expected to come from `reserve`. 3. `transferInputTokens()` does not handle the case where `ETH` could be specified as an address by the user for an output order.  ```jsx if (address(_inputToken) == ETH) {   require(address(this).balance >= _inputTokenAmount, "NF: INVALID_AMOUNT_IN");   weth.deposit{ value: _inputTokenAmount }();   return (IERC20(address(weth)), _inputTokenAmount); } ```  Hence, the attack vector is simple. Should a user accidentally send ETH to the contract, create an output `Order` with `token` being `ETH` and amount corresponding to the NestedFactory’s ETH balance.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Since plain / direct`ETH` transfers are only expected to solely come from `weth` (excluding payable functions), we recommend restricting the sender to be `weth`, like how it is done in `[FeeSplitter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L101-L104)`.          We are aware that this was raised previously here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested-findings/issues/188 and would like to add that the restricting the sender in the `receive()` function will not affect `payable` functions. From from what we see, plain ETH transfers are also not expected to come from other sources like `NestedReserve` or operators.       ```jsx receive() external payable {   require(msg.sender == address(weth), "NF: ETH_SENDER_NOT_WETH"); } ```  1. Check that `_fromReserve` is false in the scenario `address(_inputToken) == ETH`.  ```jsx if (address(_inputToken) == ETH) {   require(!_fromReserve, "NF: INVALID_INPUT_TOKEN");   require(address(this).balance >= _inputTokenAmount, "NF: INVALID_AMOUNT_IN");   weth.deposit{ value: _inputTokenAmount }();   return (IERC20(address(weth)), _inputTokenAmount); } ```
