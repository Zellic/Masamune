# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `Pools.mintSynth` function does not check if `base` is one of the base tokens. One can transfer `token`s to the pool and set `base=token` and call `mintSynth(token, token, member)`.  The `_actualInput = getAddedAmount(base, token);` will return the **token** amount added but use the ratio compared to the **base** reserve `calcSwapOutput(_actualInput=tokenInput, mapToken_baseAmount[token], mapToken_tokenAmount[token]); = tokenIn / baseAmount * tokenAmount` which yields a wrong swap result.  ## Impact  It breaks the accounting for the pool as `token`s are transferred in, but the `base` balance is increased.  The amount that is minted could also be inflated (cheaper than sending the actual base tokens), especially if `token` is a high-precision token or worth less than base.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check that `base` is either `USDV` or `VADER` in `mintSynth`.
