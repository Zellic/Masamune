# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   The functions _safeTransferFrom and _safeTransfer are similar but there is one difference: _safeTransferFrom reverts when _amount == 0 _safeTransfer  doesn't do any action when _amount == 0  I don't see any reason for the different behavior.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/TransferHelper.sol function _safeTransferFrom(address _token, address _sender, uint _amount) internal virtual {     bool success = IERC20(_token).transferFrom(_sender, address(this), _amount);     require(success, "TransferHelper: transfer failed");     require(_amount > 0, "TransferHelper: amount must be > 0");   }  //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/LendingPair.sol#L468   function _safeTransfer(IERC20 _token, address _recipient, uint _amount) internal {     if (_amount > 0) {       bool success = _token.transfer(_recipient, _amount);       require(success, "LendingPair: transfer failed");       _checkMinReserve(address(_token));     }   }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Double check the difference and perhaps apply the same logic for amount==0 to both functions.
