However when executing [`_executeInflationRateUpdate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/tokenomics/Minter.sol#L181), it first uses the current inflation rate to update the total available before checking if it needs to be reduced.   Therefore if no one mints or calls `executeInflationRateUpdate` for some time around the decay point, the inflation will be updated using the previous rate so the  `totalAvailableToNow` will grow too much.  ## Mitigation steps  You should do ```js  totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastEvent)); ```  Only if the condition `block.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` is false.   Otherwise you should do   ```js  totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD - lastEvent));  ```  Then update the rates, then complete with ```js  totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD));  ```  Note that as all these variables are either constants either already loaded in memory this is super cheap to do.
