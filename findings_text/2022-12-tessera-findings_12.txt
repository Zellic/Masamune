The purpose of this is that the proposer of a previous proposal can withdraw his collateral afterwards. However, this is done on the storage variable `proposedListing` after the new listing is already set: ```solidity _setListing(proposedListing, msg.sender, _collateral, _pricePerToken, block.timestamp);  // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral; ``` Because of that, it will actually set `pendingBalances` of the new proposer. Therefore, the old proposer loses his collateral and the new one can make proposals for free.  ## Proof Of Concept ```diff --- a/test/seaport/OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol +++ b/test/seaport/OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol @@ -379,8 +379,11 @@ contract OptimisticListingSeaportTest is SeaportTestUtil {      /// ===== LIST =====      /// ================      function testList(uint256 _collateral, uint256 _price) public {          // setup          testPropose(_collateral, _price); +        assertEq(optimistic.pendingBalances(vault, bob), 0);          _increaseTime(PROPOSAL_PERIOD);          _collateral = _boundCollateral(_collateral, bobTokenBalance);          _price = _boundPrice(_price); ``` This test fails and `optimistic.pendingBalances(vault, bob)` is equal to `_collateral`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Run `pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral;` before the `_setListing` call, in which case the above PoC no longer works.
