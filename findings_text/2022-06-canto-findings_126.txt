For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of “false” is returned. It’s important to check this, users or admin could gain or lose tokens if return value of transfer() is not checked.  The following functions are affected: Comptroller.grantCompInternal() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1380 AccountantDelegate.sweepInterest() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L87 AccountantDelegate.sweepInterest() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L89 TreasuryDelegate.sendFund() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Treasury/TreasuryDelegate.sol#L52 TreasuryDelegate.sendFund() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Treasury/TreasuryDelegate.sol#L56 CErc20.sweepToken() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CErc20.sol#L128 CEther.doTransferOut() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CEther.sol#L150 TreasuryDelegate.sendFund() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Treasury/TreasuryDelegate.sol#L52 TreasuryDelegate.sendFund() - https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Treasury/TreasuryDelegate.sol#L56  ## Tools Used Slither and manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check the returned values of transfers or use a SafeERC20 transfer.
