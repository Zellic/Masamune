# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol/blob/7ca848f2779e2e64ed0b4756c02f0137ecd73e50/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L147-L152  ```solidity function changePublisher(address newPublisher) onlyPublisher public override {         require(newPublisher != address(0));          if (pendingPublisher.publisher != address(0) && pendingPublisher.publisher == newPublisher) {             require(block.number >= pendingPublisher.block + TIMELOCK_DURATION);             publisher = newPublisher; ```  `pendingPublisher.publisher` will never be `address(0)` if `newPublisher != address(0)` and `pendingPublisher.publisher == newPublisher`.  Removing `pendingPublisher.publisher != address(0)` can make the code simpler and save some gas.  ### Recommendation  Remove the redundant assertion.
