Further, it was explained that since pricing comes from an oracle, and there would have to be unusual coordination between the two to affect outcomes, the group was given the ability to clear the pricing flag to get things moving again once the price was determined to be valid  ## Impact If an oracle price falls out of the valid min/max range, the `citadelPriceFlag` is set to true, but the out-of-bounds value is not stored. If the policy operations team calls `clearCitadelPriceFlag()`, the stale price from before the flag will be used. Not only is it an issue because of stale prices, but this means the policy op team now has a way to affect pricing not under the control of the oracle (i.e. no unusual coordination required to affect an outcome). Incorrect pricing leads to incorrect asset valuations, and loss of funds.  ## Proof of Concept  The flag is set but the price is not stored File: src/Funding.sol (lines [427-437](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/18f8c392b6fc303fe95602eba6303725023e53da/src/Funding.sol#L427-L437)) ```solidity         if (             _citadelPriceInAsset < minCitadelPriceInAsset ||             _citadelPriceInAsset > maxCitadelPriceInAsset         ) {             citadelPriceFlag = true;             emit CitadelPriceFlag(                 _citadelPriceInAsset,                 minCitadelPriceInAsset,                 maxCitadelPriceInAsset             );         } else { ```  ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Always set the `citadelPriceInAsset`
