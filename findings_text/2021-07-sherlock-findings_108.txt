# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `_doSherX` function does not return the correct precision of `sherUsd` and it is **not** the "Total amount of USD of the underlying tokens that are being transferred" that the documentation mentions.  ```solidity sherUsd = amounts[i].mul(sx.tokenUSD[tokens[i]]); ```  Instead, the amount is inflated by `1e18`, it should divide the amount by `1e18` to get a USD value with 18 decimal precision.  The severity is low as the calling site in `payout` makes up for it by dividing by `1e18` in the `deduction` computation.  We still recommend returning the correct amount in `_doSherX` already to match the documentation and avoid any future errors when using its unintuitive return value.
