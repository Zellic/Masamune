# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `LendingPair.liquidateAccount` function does not accrue and update the `cumulativeInterestRate` first, it only calls `_accrueAccountInterest` which does not update and instead uses the old `cumulativeInterestRate`.  ## Impact The liquidatee (borrower)'s state will not be up to date. I could skip some interest payments by liquidating myself instead of repaying if I'm under-water. As the market interest index is not accrued, the borrower does not need to pay any interest accrued from the time of the last accrual until now.  ## Recommendation It should call `accrueAccount` instead of `_accrueAccountInterest`
