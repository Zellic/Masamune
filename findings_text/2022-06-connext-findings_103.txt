# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L80    # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  When repaying the AAVE Portal in [`repayAavePortal()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L80) the `_local` asset is used to repay the loan in `_backLoan()` rather than the `adopted` asset. This is likely to cause issues in production when actually repaying loans if the asset/token being repayed to AAVE is not the same as the asset/token that was borrowed.  ## Proof of Concept The comment on [`L93`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L93) of [`PortalFacet.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol) states;  ``` // Need to swap into adopted asset or asset that was backing the loan // The router will always be holding collateral in the local asset while the loaned asset // is the adopted asset ```  The swap is executed on [`L98`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L98) in the call to `AssetLogic.swapFromLocalAssetIfNeededForExactOut()` however the return value `adopted` is never used (it's an unused local variable). The full function is shown below;  ``` // Swap for exact `totalRepayAmount` of adopted asset to repay aave (bool success, uint256 amountIn, address adopted) = AssetLogic.swapFromLocalAssetIfNeededForExactOut(   _local,   totalAmount,   _maxIn );  if (!success) revert PortalFacet__repayAavePortal_swapFailed();  // decrement router balances unchecked {   s.routerBalances[msg.sender][_local] -= amountIn; }  // back loan _backLoan(_local, _backingAmount, _feeAmount, _transferId); ``` The balance of the `_local` token is reduced but instead of the `adopted` token being passed to [`_backLoan()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L112) in L112 the `_local` token is used. ## Tools Used Vim  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps To be consistent with the comments in the [`repayAavePortal()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L80) function `adopted` should be passed to `_backLoan` so that the loan is repayed in the appropriate token.  Remove the reference to `_local` in the [`_backLoan()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/PortalFacet.sol#L112) function and replace it with `adopted` so it reads;  `_backLoan(adopted, _backingAmount, _feeAmount, _transferId);`
