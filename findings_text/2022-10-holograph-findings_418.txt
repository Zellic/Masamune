Calling the `nonRevertingBridgeCall` function can possibly execute `revert(0, 0)` if the external call to the bridge contract is not successful. When this occurs, the code in the `catch` block of the `try ... {...} catch {...}` code mentioned above will run, which does not make calling the `executeJob` function revert. As a result, even though the job is not successfully executed, the sent ETH is locked in the `HolographOperator` contract since there is no other way to transfer such sent ETH out from this contract. In this situation, the operator that calls the `executeJob` function will lose the sent ETH.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L301-L439 ```solidity   function executeJob(bytes calldata bridgeInRequestPayload) external payable {          ...      /**      * @dev execute the job      */     try       HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(         msg.sender,         bridgeInRequestPayload       )     {       /// @dev do nothing     } catch {       _failedJobs[hash] = true;       emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);     }     /**      * @dev every executed job (even if failed) increments total message counter by one      */     ++_inboundMessageCounter;     /**      * @dev reward operator (with HLG) for executing the job      * @dev this is out of scope and is purposefully omitted from code      */     ////  _bondedOperators[msg.sender] += reward;   } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L445-L478 ```solidity   function nonRevertingBridgeCall(address msgSender, bytes calldata payload) external payable {     require(msg.sender == address(this), "HOLOGRAPH: operator only call");     assembly {       /**        * @dev remove gas price from end        */       calldatacopy(0, payload.offset, sub(payload.length, 0x20))       /**        * @dev hToken recipient is injected right before making the call        */       mstore(0x84, msgSender)       /**        * @dev make non-reverting call        */       let result := call(         /// @dev gas limit is retrieved from last 32 bytes of payload in-memory value         mload(sub(payload.length, 0x40)),         /// @dev destination is bridge contract         sload(_bridgeSlot),         /// @dev any value is passed along         callvalue(),         /// @dev data is retrieved from 0 index memory position         0,         /// @dev everything except for last 32 bytes (gas limit) is sent         sub(payload.length, 0x40),         0,         0       )       if eq(result, 0) {         revert(0, 0)       }       return(0, 0)     }   } ```  ## Proof of Concept First, please add the following `OperatorAndBridgeMocks.sol` file in `src\mock\`. ```solidity pragma solidity 0.8.13;  // OperatorMock contract simulates the logic flows used in HolographOperator contract's executeJob and nonRevertingBridgeCall functions contract OperatorMock {     bool public isJobExecuted = true;      BridgeMock bridgeMock = new BridgeMock();      // testExecuteJob function here simulates the logic flow used in HolographOperator.executeJob function     function testExecuteJob() external payable {         try IOperatorMock(address(this)).testBridgeCall{value: msg.value}() {         } catch {             isJobExecuted = false;         }     }          // testBridgeCall function here simulates the logic flow used in HolographOperator.nonRevertingBridgeCall function     function testBridgeCall() external payable {         // as a simulation, the external call that sends ETH to bridgeMock contract will revert         (bool success, ) = address(bridgeMock).call{value: msg.value}("");         if (!success) {             assembly {                 revert(0, 0)             }         }         assembly {             return(0, 0)         }     } }  interface IOperatorMock {     function testBridgeCall() external payable; }  contract BridgeMock {     receive() external payable {         revert();     } } ```  Then, please add the following `POC.ts` file in `test\`. ```typescript import { expect } from "chai"; import { ethers } from "hardhat";  describe('POC', () => {     it("It is possible that operator loses sent ETH after calling HolographOperator contract's executeJob function", async () => {         // deploy operatorMock contract that simulates         //   the logic flows used in HolographOperator contract's executeJob and nonRevertingBridgeCall functions         const OperatorMockFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('OperatorMock');         const operatorMock = await OperatorMockFactory.deploy();         await operatorMock.deployed();          await operatorMock.testExecuteJob({value: 500});          // even though the job is not successfully executed, the sent ETH is locked in operatorMock contract         const isJobExecuted = await operatorMock.isJobExecuted();         expect(isJobExecuted).to.be.eq(false);         expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(operatorMock.address)).to.be.eq(500);     }); }); ```  Last, please run `npx hardhat test test/POC.ts --network hardhat`. The `It is possible that operator loses sent ETH after calling HolographOperator contract's executeJob function` test will pass to demonstrate the described scenario.  ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In the `catch` block of the `try ... {...} catch {...}` code mentioned above in the Impact section, the code can be updated to transfer the `msg.value` amount of ETH back to the operator, which is `msg.sender` for the `HolographOperator` contract's `executeJob` function, when this described situation occurs.
