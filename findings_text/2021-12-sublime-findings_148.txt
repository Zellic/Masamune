# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `if` conditions in `Pool.withdrawLiquidity` are distinct conditions on the pool status. Therefore, `else if` is semantically equivalent but more gas efficient.  ```solidity if (_loanStatus == LoanStatus.DEFAULTED || _loanStatus == LoanStatus.TERMINATED) {     uint256 _totalAsset;     if (poolConstants.borrowAsset != address(0)) {         _totalAsset = IERC20(poolConstants.borrowAsset).balanceOf(address(this));     } else {         _totalAsset = address(this).balance;     }     //assuming their will be no tokens in pool in any case except liquidation (to be checked) or we should store the amount in liquidate()     _toTransfer = _toTransfer.mul(_totalAsset).div(totalSupply()); } // @audit gas: use else if, status fields are distinct, only one of the branches is (if ever) executed anyway if (_loanStatus == LoanStatus.CANCELLED) {     _toTransfer = _toTransfer.add(_toTransfer.mul(poolVariables.penaltyLiquidityAmount).div(totalSupply())); }  if (_loanStatus == LoanStatus.CLOSED) {     //transfer repayment     _withdrawRepayment(msg.sender); } ```
