# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Per the `arb-bridge-eth` code:  > all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/78118ba205854374ed280a27415cb62c37847f72/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L313  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1ArbitrumMessenger.sol#L65-L74  ```solidity uint256 seqNum = inbox.createRetryableTicket{value: _l1CallValue}(     target,     _l2CallValue,     maxSubmissionCost,     from,     from,     maxGas,     gasPriceBid,     data ); ```  At L308-L309, ETH held by `BridgeMinter` is withdrawn to L1Migrator:  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L308-L309  ```solidity         uint256 amount = IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr)             .withdrawETHToL1Migrator(); ```  However, when calling `sendTxToL2()` the parameter `_l1CallValue` is only the `msg.value`, therefore, the ETH transferred to L2 does not include any funds from `bridgeMinter`.   https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L318-L327  ```solidity     sendTxToL2(         l2MigratorAddr,         address(this), // L2 alias of this contract will receive refunds         msg.value,         amount,         _maxSubmissionCost,         _maxGas,         _gasPriceBid,         ""     ) ```  As a result, due to lack of funds, `call` with value = amount to `l2MigratorAddr` will always fail on L2.  Since there is no other way to send ETH to L2, all the ETH from `bridgeMinter` is now frozen in the contract.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity     sendTxToL2(         l2MigratorAddr,         address(this), // L2 alias of this contract will receive refunds         msg.value + amount, // the `amount` withdrawn from BridgeMinter should be added         amount,         _maxSubmissionCost,         _maxGas,         _gasPriceBid,         ""     ) ```
