# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  For better code readability, it would be good to specify the constants `uint16(-1)`, `uint32(-1)` and `10**18` in a separate contract to be imported in relevant contracts.  - `10e17` was used in payout() instead of the conventional `10**18` defined everywhere else - The docs specified that the cooldown fee and sherX weight are scaled by `10**18`, but they are scaled by `uint32(-1)` and `uint16(-1)` respectively (interfaces natspec is correct).  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider suggestive constants like `MAX_SHERX_WEIGHT` or `SHERX_DENOM`, `MAX_COOLDOWN_FEE` or `COOLDOWN_FEE_DENOM` and `PRECISION`.
