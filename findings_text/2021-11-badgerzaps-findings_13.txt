# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Function `deposit` in `IbbtcVaultZap.sol` computes two additions without overflow protection, see lines [158](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-ibbtc-utility-zaps/blob/6f700995129182fec81b772f97abab9977b46026/contracts/IbbtcVaultZap.sol#L158) and [166](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-ibbtc-utility-zaps/blob/6f700995129182fec81b772f97abab9977b46026/contracts/IbbtcVaultZap.sol#L166).  In the first case, i.e. line 158, the addition can be changed to an assignment, as `depositAmount[i]` is always 0.  In the second case, i.e. line 166, an overflow would lead to a wrong amount of funds deposited into Curve and from there to a wrong amount of LP tokens send to the `msg.sender`.  ## Recommended Steps of Mitigation As OpenZeppelin's `SafeMathUpgradeable` library is already imported, use their `add` function instead of the native `+` operator.
