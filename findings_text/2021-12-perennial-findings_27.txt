# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Every call to an external contract costs a decent amount of gas.  There are many times across the codebase that will perform two external calls to the provider to query the current `oraclePrice`:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/product/types/position/AccountPosition.sol#L72-L72  ```solidity=72 Fixed18 oraclePrice = provider.priceAtVersion(provider.currentVersion()); ```  Consider adding a new method to the provider and return the current `oraclePrice` directly can combine two external calls into one and save some gas.
