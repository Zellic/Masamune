# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In HybridPool.sol, functions `_getY` and `_getYD` are identical (only differences are variables' names), and only `_getY` is used in the contract.  Since these functions are supposed to mimic those of Curve, it would make more sense to follow their naming conventions. In particular, `_getYD` correctly mimics Curve's `_get_y_D` ([ref](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/base/SwapTemplateBase.vy#L614)), while `_getY` does not mimic Curve's `_get_y` ([ref](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/base/SwapTemplateBase.vy#L379)).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider eliminating `_getY` and using `_getYD` instead in the contract.
