# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-inverse/blob/main/src/Market.sol#L605-L610   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact User can free from liquidation fee if its escrow balance less than the calculated liquidation fee.  ## Proof of Concept If the `liquidationFeeBps` is enabled, the `gov` should receive the liquidation fee. But if user's escrow balance is less than the calculated liquidation fee, `gov` got nothing. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-inverse/blob/main/src/Market.sol#L605-L610  ```solidity         if(liquidationFeeBps > 0) {             uint liquidationFee = repaidDebt * 1 ether / price * liquidationFeeBps / 10000;             if(escrow.balance() >= liquidationFee) {                 escrow.pay(gov, liquidationFee);             }         } ```   ## Tools Used manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps User should pay all the remaining escrow balance if the calculated liquidation fee is greater than its escrow balance.  ```solidity         if(liquidationFeeBps > 0) {             uint liquidationFee = repaidDebt * 1 ether / price * liquidationFeeBps / 10000;             if(escrow.balance() >= liquidationFee) {                 escrow.pay(gov, liquidationFee);             } else {                 escrow.pay(gov, escrow.balance());             }         } ```
