User A fulfills the order using LooksRareAggregator.execute and sends 102 ETH, where order.price == 100 ETH. Since the other user fulfilled the order before User A, when User A fulfills the order, the order status is 99/100 Eventually User A buys an item for 1 ETH but pays a fee of 2 ETH. ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/e3b2c053f722b0ca2dce3a3eb06f64859b8b7a6f/contracts/proxies/SeaportProxy.sol#L136-L147  ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider charging fees based on the user's actual filled price
