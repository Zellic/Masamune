# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Proof of Concept There is no need to cache calculation steps between the return values. `L98-L122` is as follows: ```         uint256 _endingBalance = _token.balanceOf(_recipient);         uint256 _withdrawnAmount = _token.balanceOf(_recipient).sub(_startingBalance);          uint256 _endingTotalValue = _self.totalValue();         uint256 _decreasedValue = _startingTotalValue.sub(_endingTotalValue); ```  Which can be replaced by following code to save gas:  ```         uint256 _withdrawnAmount = _token.balanceOf(_recipient).sub(_startingBalance);          uint256 _decreasedValue = _startingTotalValue.sub(_self.totalValue()); ```  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis
