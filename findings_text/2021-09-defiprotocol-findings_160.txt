# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `validateWeights()` function can be better optimised by using a hashmap to measure token uniqueness. Currently, the function utilises an `O(n^2)` solution. By first iterating through each hashmap index for `_tokens`, any previously set tokens can be first cleared . This improves the current solution to `O(n)`.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L53-L70  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using a hashmap to measure token uniqueness. However, this hashmap needs to first be cleared out before using it each time in `validateWeights()`.
