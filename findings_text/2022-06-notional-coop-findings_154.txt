These two hooks will in turn call the `_redeemMaturedPositions` function to ensure that no matured fCash positions remain in the Set by redeeming any matured fCash position.

However, if one of the fCash redemptions fails, it will cause the entire function to revert. If this happens, no one could purchase or redeem the setToken because `moduleIssueHook` and `modileRedeemHook` hooks will revert every single time. Thus, the setToken issuance and redemption will stop working entirely and  this setToken can be considered "bricked".

User's fund will stuck in the SetToken Contract. Unable to remove matured fCash positions from SetToken and update positions of its asset token.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  This is a problem commonly encountered whenever a method of a smart contract calls another contract – you cannot rely on the other contract to work 100% of the time, and it is dangerous to assume that the external call will always be successful.   It is recommended to:  - Consider alternate method of updating the asset position so that the SetToken's core functions (e.g. issuance and redemption) will not be locked if one of the matured fCash redemptions fails.  - Evaluate if `_redeemMaturedPositions` really need to be called during SetToken's issuance and redemption. If not, consider removing them from the hooks, so that any issue or revert within `_redeemMaturedPositions` won't cause the SetToken's issuance and redemption functions to stop working entirely. - Consider implementing additional function to give manager/user an option to specify a list of matured fCash positions to redeem instead of forcing them to redeem all matured fCash positions at one go.
