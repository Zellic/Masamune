This applies to both a proxy and its implementation...   ## Proof of Concept This can lead to takeover of 2 contracts: `Basket.sol` and `NibblVault.sol` since implementation contracts not initialized and can be initialized publicly. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/Basket.sol   Also, Upgrading either of their implementation in `NibblVaultFactory.sol` when  `proposeNewVaultImplementation(address _newVaultImplementation)` or `proposeNewBasketImplementation(address _newBasketImplementation)` can lead to the same issue if the upgraded contract did not disable initializers. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVaultFactory.sol#L158 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVaultFactory.sol#L99    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps As its mentioned in OpenZeppelin Contracts documentation:  >To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:   ``` /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor     constructor() {         _disableInitializers();     } ```  Should both of `Basket.sol` and `NibbleVault.sol` use the `_disableInitializers();` which make the implementation contract unable to be initialized to version 1. Hence, for newer version of `Basket.sol` and `NibbleVault.sol` proposed for the factory should also be initialized to version 1 to prevent the attack https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVaultFactory.sol#L165 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVaultFactory.sol#L130
