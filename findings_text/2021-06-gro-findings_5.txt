# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function setWithdrawHandler allows the setting of withdrawHandler and emergencyHandler. However emergencyHandler isn't checked for 0 (like the withdrawHandler ) The value of the emergencyHandler is also not emitted (like the withdrawHandler )  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/Controller.sol#L105  function setWithdrawHandler(address _withdrawHandler, address _emergencyHandler) external onlyOwner {         require(_withdrawHandler != address(0), "setWithdrawHandler: 0x");         withdrawHandler = _withdrawHandler;         emergencyHandler = _emergencyHandler;         emit LogNewWithdrawHandler(_withdrawHandler);     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add something like:         require(_emergencyHandler!= address(0), "setEmergencyHandler: 0x");         event LogNewEmergencyHandler(address tokens);         emit LogNewEmergencyHandler(_emergencyHandler);
