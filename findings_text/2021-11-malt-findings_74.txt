# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Being instantiated with wrong configuration, the contract is inoperable and deploy gas costs will be lost. If misconfiguration is noticed too late the various types of malfunctions become possible.  ## Proof of Concept  The checks for zero addresses during contract construction and initialization are considered to be the best-practice.  Now basically all the contract do not check for correctness of constructor arguments:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Malt.sol#L29  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/RewardSystem/RewardOverflowPool.sol#L25  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/TransferService.sol#L25  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/ForfeitHandler.sol#L31  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/MiningService.sol#L30  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L47  ...  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add zero-address checks and key non-address variables checks in all contract constructors. Small increase of gas costs are far out weighted by wrong deploy costs savings and additional coverage against misconfiguration.
