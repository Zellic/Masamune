# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The sweepToken() function in the original Compound code whose specified purpose was to recover accidentally sent ERC20 tokens to contract has been removed.   The original code comment says: “A public function to sweep accidental ERC-20 transfers to this contract. Tokens are sent to admin (timelock).” This safety measure is helpful given the number/value of accidentally stuck tokens that are sent to contracts by mistake.  Tokens accidentally sent to this contract will be stuck leading to fund loss for sender.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/b9b14038612d846b83f8a009a82c38974ff2dcfe/contracts/CErc20.sol#L112-L120  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-basedloans/blob/5c8bb51a3fdc334ea0a68fd069be092123212020/code/contracts/CErc20.sol#L109-L121  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Retain this function unless there is a specific reason to remove it here.
