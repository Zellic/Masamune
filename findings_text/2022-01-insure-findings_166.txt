# Handle  Jujic   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The use of _msgSender() when there is no implementation of a meta transaction mechanism that uses it, such as EIP-2771, very slightly increases gas consumption.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/InsureDAOERC20.sol#L105  ``` function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)         public         virtual         override         returns (bool)     {         _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);         return true;     } ```  ## Tools Used Remix ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace _msgSender() with msg.sender if there is no mechanism to support meta-transactions like EIP-2771 implemented.
