(See GiantMevAndFeesPool afterTokenTransfer() - no adjustment is made to claimed[] on the from side.) As a result, their claimed[] may be higher than the max amount they could possibly have claimed for their new (smaller) number of tokens. The erroneous claimed value can cause an integer overflow when the claimed[] value is subtracted, leading to inability for this user to access some functions of the GiantMevAndFeesPool - including such things as being able to transfer their tokens (overflow is triggered in a callback attempting to pay out their rewards). These overflows will occur in SyndicateRewardsProcessor's _previewAccumulatedETH() and _distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken(), the latter of which is called in a number of places. When rewards are later accumulated in the pool, the user will not be able to claim certain rewards owed to them because of the incorrect (high) claimed[] value. The excess rewards will be orphaned in the pool.  ## Proof of Concept This patch demonstrates both DOS and orphaned rewards due to the claimed[] error described above. Note that the patch includes a temp fix for the separate issue calculating claimed[] in _distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken() in order to demonstrate this is a separate issue.

Alternatively, claimed[] could be calculated on a per share basis rather than a total basis in order to simplify some of the adjustments that must be made in the code for claimed[].
