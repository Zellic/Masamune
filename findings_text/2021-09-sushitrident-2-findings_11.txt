# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  No check is performed for the initial price. This means that it can be set to be below the `MIN_SQRT_RATIO` or above `MAX_SQRT_RATIO` (Eg. zero value), which will prevent the usability of all other functions (minting, swapping, burning).  For example, `Ticks.insert()` would fail when attempting to calculate `actualNearestTick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(currentPrice);`, which means no one will be able to mint positions.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check the `initialPrice` is within the acceptable range, ie. `MIN_SQRT_RATIO <= initialPrice <= MAX_SQRT_RATIO`
