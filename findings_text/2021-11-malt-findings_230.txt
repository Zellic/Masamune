# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `permit` function is intended to facilitate approvals though signature verification. This helps to merge the two-step token transfer process consisting of an initial token approval and subsequent transfer. The `permit` function emits an `Approval` event, however, the `_approve` function also emits the same `Approval` event. As a result, off-chain scripts monitoring the blockchain for such events will see the same event emitted twice which may cause unintended issues.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/ERC20Permit.sol#L58-L59 https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L314  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider not emitting an `Approval` event in `permit`.
