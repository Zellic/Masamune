Each of these receipts will need to be withdrawn before the owner can call `withdrawExcessRewards()`.   The impact is the owner would have to pay an unbounded amount of gas to `withdraw()` all the accounts and receive their excess funds.  ## Proof of Concept  `withdrawExcessRewards()` has the requirement that `totalDepositsWei` for the pool is zero before the owner may call this function as seen on line 245.  ```solidity         require(pool.totalDepositsWei == 0, 'Cannot withdraw until all deposits are withdrawn'); ```  `pool.totalDepositsWei` is added to each time a user calls `deposit()`. It is increased by the amount the user deposits. There are no restrictions on the amount that may be deposited as a result a user may add 1 wei (or the smallest unit on any currency) which has negligible value.  The owner can force withdraw these accounts by calling `withdraw()` so long as `block.timestamp > pool.endTime`. They would be required to do this for each account that was created.  This could be a significant amount of gas costs, especially if the gas price has increased since the attacker originally made the deposits.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding a minimum deposit amount for each pool that can be configured by the pool owner.  Alternatively, allow the owner to call `withdrawExcessRewards()` given some other criteria such as  - A fix period of time (e.g. 1 month) has passed since the end of the auction; and - 90% of the deposits have been withdrawn These criteria can be customised as desired by the design team.
