# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Event log poisoning is possible by griefing attackers who have no DAO weight but vote and emit event that takes up event log space.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L382  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L393   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Emit event only if non-zero weight as relevant to proposal voting/cancelling.
