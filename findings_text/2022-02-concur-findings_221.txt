# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There is no functionality for removing pools/setting pool's allocPoints. Therefore `totalAllocPoint` only increases and rewards for pool decreases.  ## Proof of Concept Scenario: 1. Owner adds new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 900 (totalAllocPoint=900). 2. 1 week passes 3. First pool staking period ends (or for other reasons that pool is not meaningfully anymore). 4. Owner adds new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalAllocPoint=1000) 5. 1 block later Alice stake 10 tokens there (at the same time). 6. 1 week passes 7. After some time Alice claims rewards. But she is eligible only for 10% of the rewards. 90% goes to unused pool.  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add functionality for removing pool or functionality for setting pool's `totalAllocPoint` param.
