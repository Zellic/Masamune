# Handle  p4st13r4   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `PoolTemplate.sol` and `IndexTemplate.sol` report this same error when trying to withdraw and some conditions are not met: "ERROR: WITHDRAWAL_PENDING”  However, `PoolTemplate.sol` does that when the `marketStatus` is not `Trading`; `IndexTemplate.sol` when the contract is locked. Since `CDSTemplate.sol`, instead, implement a different revert string, it’s best for understanding what revert strings are related to by making them as explicit and clear as possible. `CDSTemplate.sol` has this in the `withdraw` function:  ```jsx require(paused == false, "ERROR: PAUSED"); ```  ## Proof of Concept  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L217](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L217)  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L302](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L302)  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Improve revert strings wording
