# Handle  Czar102   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The initialization status is defined by the [name and symbol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/ERC20/ERC20Facet.sol#L25-L28). It is possible it set them back to an empty string, uninitializing the contract and letting the `initialize(..)` function be called again. This way, the owner may, for example, hide minting additional tokens. Or, after accidentally setting name and symbol to empty strings, anyone can take control over the contract and mint any number of tokens.  In general, it shouldn't be possible to initialize more than once.  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding empty string checks in `setName(...)` and `setSymbol(...)` functions.
