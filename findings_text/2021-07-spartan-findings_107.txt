# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  If moveDAO() is executed after voting, the existing DAO contract continues to function as before whereas it should ideally cease to function/exist from the users’ perspective or at least function as a clone of the new DAO by using the same addresses as it does.  Scenario: moveDAO is executed to make DAO and BASE.DAO point to the new address. Existing DAO contract continues to function but all the other interfacing contracts (ROUTER, UTILS, DAOVAULT, BONDVAULT, SYNTHVAULT, POOLFACTORY, SYNTHFACTORY and RESERVE) use the updated DAO address as updated in BASE. At a minimum, this leads to undefined behavior and at worst an attack where the old DAOs (there could be many) are exploited because it still points to valid router, pool and vault contracts.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L451-L459   changeDAO: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/outside-scope/Sparta.sol#L189-L193   Use of BASE.DAO: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/BondVault.sol#L54-L57  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/DaoVault.sol#L32-L34  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L39-L41  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L41-L43  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Synth.sol#L20-L22  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Synth.sol#L20-L22  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Utils.sol#L29-L31  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L35-L37  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthFactory.sol#L27-L29  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthVault.sol#L45-L47  Updated Getters: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L614-L684  Example uses of stale interface contract addresses _* instead of using Dao(DAO).* versions: _ROUTER: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L259  _BONDVAULT: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L281  _UTILS: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L205  _RESERVE: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L188  etc.  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  At a minimum, all DAO public/external functions should check and revert if daoHasMoved or the design can even consider a selfdestruct to destroy the DAO contract once it has successfully handed over to the new DAO contract and all pending actions have been cleared. In the unlikely requirement of older DAO contracts continuing to exist, they should at least use addresses of interfacing contracts as reported by the new DAO which could have updated them.
