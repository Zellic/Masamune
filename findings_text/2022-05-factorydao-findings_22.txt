Some tokens such as USDT return nothing. This could lead to funds stuck in the contract without possibility to retrieve them. Using safeTransferFrom of SafeERC20.sol is recommended instead.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol  ## Tools Used   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps
