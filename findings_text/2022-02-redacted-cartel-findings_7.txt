If the `bribeVault` is modified in `setBribeVault()` then users who have ETH rewards will now be considered to have `ERC20(bribeVault)` tokens. Since `bribeVault` is not an ERC20 token the `transfer()` call will fail and the users will not be able to claim their funds.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider removing the functionality to change the `bribeVault` or ensuring all funds have been withdraw i.e. `balanceOf(address(this)) == 0` before changing the `bribeVault`.
