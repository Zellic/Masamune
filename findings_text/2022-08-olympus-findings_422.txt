That said, I don't think this scenario is very likely since it requires a trusted contract not part of initial release(? no contract in repo used a loan) to take a large loan from TRSRY.  ## Proof of Concept this will cause test to fail on TRANSFER_FAILED due to TRSRY not having the tokens to transfer but `getReserveBalance` says it has, since capacity is determined based on non-existing tokens.  ```diff diff --git a/src/test/policies/Operator.t.sol b/src/test/policies/Operator.t.sol index e09aec1..5c1e95f 100644 --- a/src/test/policies/Operator.t.sol +++ b/src/test/policies/Operator.t.sol @@ -26,6 +26,8 @@ import {OlympusMinter, OHM} from "modules/MINTR.sol";  import {Operator} from "policies/Operator.sol";  import {BondCallback} from "policies/BondCallback.sol";   +import {ModuleTestFixtureGenerator} from "test/lib/ModuleTestFixtureGenerator.sol"; +  contract MockOhm is ERC20 {      constructor(          string memory _name, @@ -45,6 +47,7 @@ contract MockOhm is ERC20 {  // solhint-disable-next-line max-states-count  contract OperatorTest is Test {      using FullMath for uint256; +    using ModuleTestFixtureGenerator for OlympusTreasury;        UserFactory public userCreator;      address internal alice; @@ -53,6 +56,9 @@ contract OperatorTest is Test {      address internal policy;      address internal heart;   +    address public debtor; +    address public godmode;  +      RolesAuthority internal auth;      BondAggregator internal aggregator;      BondFixedTermTeller internal teller; @@ -187,6 +193,18 @@ contract OperatorTest is Test {            reserve.mint(address(treasury), testReserve * 100);   +        debtor = treasury.generateFunctionFixture(treasury.getLoan.selector); +        godmode = treasury.generateGodmodeFixture(type(OlympusTreasury).name); +         +        kernel.executeAction(Actions.ActivatePolicy, godmode); +        kernel.executeAction(Actions.ActivatePolicy, debtor); +         +        vm.prank(godmode); +        treasury.setApprovalFor(debtor, reserve, testReserve * 100); + +        vm.prank(debtor); +        treasury.getLoan(reserve,testReserve*100); +          // Approve the operator and bond teller for the tokens to swap          vm.prank(alice);          ohm.approve(address(operator), testOhm * 20); ```  same is applicable for low market bonds since they are created based on the same capacity  ## Tools Used vs code + tests  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps determine capacity from actual tokens held by treasury.
