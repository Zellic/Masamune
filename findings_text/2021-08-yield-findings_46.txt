# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  As noted in the code comment, peek and get functions are the same for this oracle. So we can change `peek` to public visibility and have `get` call `peek` instead of copying the same code here. Minor deployment cost savings but increase in readability/maintainability.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/oracles/composite/CompositeMultiOracle.sol#L91  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/oracles/composite/CompositeMultiOracle.sol#L74-L128  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace two functions having the same code with a single function.
