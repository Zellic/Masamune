# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  NFT token operations will fail if wrong reserve is used.  ## Proof of Concept  ```NestedFactory``` ```reserve``` is used in ```addtokens``` and ```withdraw``` function for a given NFT, but the NFT to reserve contract correspondence isn't checked.  addtokens: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L119  withdraw: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L241  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the ```require(nestedRecords.getAssetReserve(_nftId) == address(reserve), "...")``` check in the beginning of the functions.
