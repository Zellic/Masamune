# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `cTokenAggregator.decimals` value is set to `18` but `cTokens` only have `8` decimals. It's unclear what this `decimals` field refers to.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps If it should refer to the `cToken` decimals, it's wrong and should be set to `8`. This value is not used inside the contract but it's `public` and anyone can read it.
