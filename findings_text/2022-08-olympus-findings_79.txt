The purpose of it is to update the prices and do another operations related to bond market. User who ran it are rewarded. There is no need to run this function more then 1 time in `frequency()` period. However if `beat()` was last time called more then `frequency()` time ago then user can execute `beat()` function `(block.timestamp - lastBeat)/frequency()` times in a row in same block and get rewards.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/Heart.sol#L92 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/Heart.sol#L103   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/Heart.sol#L103 Change this line to `lastBeat = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp - lastBeat) % frequency();` So no matter how much time the `beat()` was no called, it is possible to call it only once per `frequency()`.
