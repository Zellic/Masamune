When the user stakes, update doesn't do anything (including updating _mostRecentValueCalcTime) since totalCurrentStake = 0, and _userWeighted[account] gets set to _totalWeight (which hasn't been updated) in the stake function. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L349 ``` function _stake(uint256 lpTokenIn, address account) private {         ...         _userWeighted[account] = _totalWeight;         ...     } ``` When the user withdraws, totalCurrentStake is no longer zero. Since _mostRecentValueCalcTime wasn't updated when the user staked (since totalCurrentStake was 0), the reward from the period with no stakers gets added to _totalWeight.  `uint256 sinceLastCalc = block.timestamp.sub(_mostRecentValueCalcTime);` `value = sinceLastCalc.mul(perSecondReward);` `_totalWeight = _totalWeight.add(value.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));` (These are lines in the update modifier)  As a result, this user who staked and immediately withdrew, got all the reward from the period with no stakers. See the reward calculation: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L371 ``` function _applyReward(address account) private returns (uint256 lpTokenOut, uint256 reward, uint256 remainder, uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) {         ...         reward = lpTokenOut.mul(_totalWeight.sub(_userWeighted[account])).div(calculateMultiplier(account, true));         ...     } ```  Observe that the exploit condition is met as soon as the staking period starts (as long as nobody stakes immediately). The code attempts to prevent this situation setting _mostRecentValueCalcTime to firstStakeTime the first time that update is invoked (which must be a stake call). https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L89-L91 ``` if (_mostRecentValueCalcTime == 0) {             _mostRecentValueCalcTime = firstStakeTime;         } ```           However, this doesn't do anything since the user can first set the firstStakeTime by staking as soon as the staking period starts, and then make totalCurrentStake 0 by immediately withdrawing. In fact, observe that this takes away from other staker's rewards since perSecondReward is now lower. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L98 `uint256 perSecondReward = totalRewards.div(endTime.sub(firstStakeTime));`  Please add the following test to the "advance to start time" context in amplifier.ts (add it [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/test/amplifier.ts#L157)), and run with `npm run test-amplifier`. ``` it("get reward without staking", async function () {         await this.lpToken.transfer(this.staker1.address, staker1Initial.toFixed(), {from: this.owner.address});         await this.lpToken.connect(this.staker1).approve(           this.amplifier.address,           staker1Initial.toFixed()         );                  console.log("dmute balance before: " + await this.dMuteToken.balanceOf(this.staker1.address))         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).stake(1);         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).withdraw();         await time.increaseTo(staking_end-10);         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).stake(1);         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).withdraw();         console.log("dmute balance after: " + await this.dMuteToken.balanceOf(this.staker1.address))       });        it("get reward with staking", async function () {         await this.lpToken.transfer(this.staker1.address, staker1Initial.toFixed(), {from: this.owner.address});         await this.lpToken.connect(this.staker1).approve(           this.amplifier.address,           staker1Initial.toFixed()         );         console.log("dmute balance before: " + await this.dMuteToken.balanceOf(this.staker1.address))         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).stake(1);         //await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).withdraw();         await time.increaseTo(staking_end-10);         //await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).stake(1);         await this.amplifier.connect(this.staker1).withdraw();         console.log("dmute balance after: " + await this.dMuteToken.balanceOf(this.staker1.address))       }); ``` Result on my side: ``` advance to start time         ✓ reverts without tokens approved for staking dmute balance before: 0 dmute balance after: 576922930658129099273         ✓ get reward without staking dmute balance before: 0 dmute balance after: 576922912276064160247         ✓ get reward with staking ```  This POC is a bit on the extreme side to get the point across. In the first test, the user stakes and then immediately unstakes, while in the second test, the user stakes for the entire period. In the end, the user gets roughly the same amount of reward.   ## Impact After periods with no stakers, users can get reward without staking. This is also possible at the beginning of the staking period, and doing so then will reduce the reward for other users in the process.   ## Tools Used Manual review, Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Possible solution 1: set a minimum duration that a user must stake for (prevent them from staking and immediately withdrawing) Possible solution 2: always update _mostRecentValueCalcTime (regardless totalCurrentStake). i.e. move the following line out of the if statement. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L109  Keep in mind that with solution 2, no one gets the rewards in periods with no stakers - this means that the rescueTokens function needs to be updated to get retrieve these rewards. 
# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L185-L191   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There will be 2 impacts.  - The reward system would be broken as the rewards can be withdrawn before starting staking. - Some rewards would be locked inside the contract forever as it doesn't check `totalReclaimed`  ## Proof of Concept `rescueTokens()` checks the below condition to rescue `muteToken`.  ```solidity else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {     if (totalStakers > 0) {         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards)),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     } } ```  But there are 2 problems. 1. Currently, it doesn't check anything when `totalStakers == 0`. So some parts(or 100%) of rewards can be withdrawn before the staking period. In this case, the reward system won't work properly due to the lack of rewards. 2. It checks the wrong condition when `totalStakers > 0` as well. As we can see [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L241), some remaining rewards are tracked using `totalReclaimed` and transferred to treasury directly. So we should consider this amount as well.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It should be modified like the below.  ```solidity else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {     if (totalStakers > 0) { //should check totalReclaimed as well         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards).sub(totalReclaimed)),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     }     else if(block.timestamp <= endTime) { //no stakers but staking is still active, should maintain totalRewards         require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"         );     } } ```

If `max_buy` is set to true the amount specified in the `value` parameter is ignored and instead the maximum amount available for purchase in the current epoch is used.  This can lead to a scenario where a user intends to purchase the remaining amount of current epoch, but till the tx is included in the blockchain a new epoch starts (either by an innocent user or by an attacker) and the user ends up buying the entire amount of the next epoch.  ## Impact A. The user ends up buying a much higher amount than intended B. The user ends up buying it for a lower price than intended (i.e. less payout for the buyer)  ## Proof of Concept The PoC below shows how `maxPurchaseAmount()` increases when a new era starts.   File: `test/bonds.ts` ```solidity   it('Max buy PoC', async function () {      // buy 99% of amount available for purchase in current epoch     let maxValue = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();     let depositValue = maxValue.mul(99).div(100);     await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(depositValue, buyer1.address, false);          // The amount available when the victim sends out the tx     var expectedDeposit = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()      await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit('0', buyer1.address, true);      // The amount available when the victims's tx is included in the blockchain     var actualDeposit = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();          // expected deposit = 1 wad     // actual deposit = 100 wad     console.log({expectedDeposit, actualDeposit});   }) ```  [The following snippet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/bonds/MuteBond.sol#L156-L159) shows that when a user sets `max_buy` to true the value used is the `maxPurchaseAmount()` ```solidity         if(max_buy == true){           value = maxPurchaseAmount();           payout = maxDeposit();         } else { ```    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Require the user to specify the epoch number when doing a 'max buy', and revert if it doesn't match the current epoch (it might be a good idea to refactor the code to 2 external functions for normal buy and max buy, where they both share an internal function to make the actual deposit)   Side note: this is similar to another bug I've reported regarding getting a lower price than expected, however the root cause, impact, and mitigation are different and therefore I've reported this separately.
# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/bonds/MuteBond.sol#L185-L187   # Vulnerability details  The `MuteBond` contract contains a feature in which after each purchase the `epochStart` increases by 5% of the time passed since `epochStart`, this (in most cases) lowers the bond's price (i.e. buyer gets less payout) for future purchases. An attacker can exploit this feature to front-run a deposit/purchase tx and lower the victim's payout. This can also happen by innocent users purchasing before the victim's tx is included in the blockchain.  Another (less likely) scenario in which this can happen is when the owner changes the config in a way that lowers the price (e.g. lowering max price, extending epoch duration), if the owner tx executes while a user's `deposit()` tx is in the mempool the user would end up with less payout than intended.  Side note: the term 'bond price' might be confusing since it refers to the payout the buyer gets divided by the value the buyer pays, so a higher price is actually in favor of the buyer.  ## Impact User ends up buying bond for a lower payout than intended.  ## Proof of Concept In the PoC below, an attacker manages to make the buyer purchase a bond at a price lower by 32% than intended.  File: `test/bonds.ts` ```typescript   it('Front run PoC', async function () {     // let price reach the max price     await time.increase(60 * 60 * 24 * 7)      // price when victim sends out the tx to the mempool     var expectedPrice = await bondContract.bondPrice()      const startPrice = new BigNumber(100).times(Math.pow(10,18))     let minPurchasePayout = new BigNumber(Math.pow(10,16));     // using dynamic price didn't work out so I'm using the lowest price     var minPurchaseValue = minPurchasePayout.times(1e18).div(startPrice).plus(1);      // attacker buys the lowest amount 20 times     for(let i = 0; i< 20; i++){       await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(minPurchaseValue.toFixed(), buyer1.address, false)     }      var init_dmute = await dMuteToken.GetUnderlyingTokens(buyer1.address)     let depositValue = new BigNumber(10).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed();     var price = await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(depositValue, buyer1.address, false)     var post_dmute = await dMuteToken.GetUnderlyingTokens(buyer1.address)      var dmute_diff = new BigNumber(post_dmute.toString()).minus(init_dmute.toString());     var actualPrice = dmute_diff.times(1e18).div(depositValue);      var receipt = (await price.wait())     // compare the expected price with the actual price     // expected price = 200; actual price = 135.8; meaning actual price is ~68% of expected price     console.log({expectedPrice, actualPrice:actualPrice.toString()});   }) ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a min payout parameter so that users can specify the expected payout. The tx should revert if the actual payout is lower than expected.

The admin would like to withdraw the rewards. A malicious user can front-run the rescueTokens call with a call to stake to lock all the rewards inside the contract indefinitely.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L208-L212 The require shouldn't be inside the else block.

Please add the following test case to bonds.ts and run it with `npm run test-bond` Note that if the bond price is too high (> 52e18), then this won't always be possible ([because payout will change by bondPrice every time we increment/decrement value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/bonds/MuteBond.sol#L242)). So in my POC, I set the price range to be (1e18 - 2e18), which I believe are reasonable values as well.  ``` it('Bond DOS', async function () {      await bondContract.setStartPrice(new BigNumber(1).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed())     await bondContract.setMaxPrice(new BigNumber(2).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed())     await bondContract.setMaxPayout(new BigNumber(100).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed())          // ideally, the following line is what I had in mind     // var val = new BigNumber((await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()).toString()).minus(1).toFixed()     // but due to timing issues I couldn't get it to work (I'm not very familiar with hardhat)      // so I just ran this to get the value for the next line     // await time.increase(1)     // console.log(await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount());       var val = new BigNumber("99998511926905849653").toFixed();          console.log("before:")     console.log(await bondContract.maxDeposit())     /*     console.log(await bondContract.payoutFor(val))     console.log(await bondContract.maxPayout())     console.log((await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()))     */          await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(val, buyer1.address, false)      console.log("after:")     console.log(await bondContract.maxDeposit())     /*     console.log(await bondContract.payoutFor(val))     console.log(await bondContract.maxPayout())     console.log((await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()))     */      await expect(       bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(1, buyer1.address, false)     ).to.be.reverted;               await expect(       bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(1, buyer1.address, true)     ).to.be.reverted;           await expect(       bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(new BigNumber(1).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed(), buyer1.address, false)     ).to.be.reverted;      await expect(       bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(new BigNumber(1).times(Math.pow(10,18)).toFixed(), buyer1.address, true)     ).to.be.reverted;   }) ```   ## Impact This vulnerability causes deposit to fail indefinitely. That being said, the contract itself doesn't seem to store funds, and it looks like there are ways for the admin to manually fix the DOS (e.g. deploy a new contract, set startPrice / maxPrice). So overall, I would say it warrants a medium severity.  ## Tools Used Manual Review, Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Start a new epoch if maxDeposit() is smaller than a certain threshold.

An user X has staked a large amount of LP tokens, and a user Y has staked a normal amount.  Y withdraws as soon as the staking period ends (block.timestamp > endTime), triggering the update modifier, which sets `_mostRecentValueCalcTime = block.timestamp` > endTime. Observe that after this point, the amplifier will never call claimFees again since `_mostRecentValueCalcTime < endTime` will forever be false.   Meanwhile, X forgot about it, and doesn't withdraw until say 2 weeks after endTime. When X calls withdraw, X won't get the LP fees for those 2 weeks. In fact, nobody will - they are trapped inside the mute switch pair forever since the amplifier won't call claim.   ## Impact Some LP fees can be trapped inside the mute switch pair when it should really be going to the amplifier users.   ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I believe it's best to move the [LP fee calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L111-L117) out of the if statement.

The calculation on the website shows a linear relationship between the `dMUTE / poolSize` ratio and the `APY`. The `dMUTE / poolSize` ratio is also called the `tokenRatio`.   By "linear" I mean that when a user increases his `tokenRatio` from `0` to `0.1` this has the same effect as when increasing it from `0.9` to `1`.    The implementation in the `MuteAmplifier.calculateMultiplier` function does not have this linear relationship between `tokenRatio` and `APY`.   An increase in the `tokenRatio` from `0` to `0.1` is worth much less than an increase from `0.9` to `1`.    As we will see this means that all stakers that do not have a `tokenRatio` of exactly equal `0` or exactly equal `1` lose out on rewards that they should receive according to the documentation.    I estimate this to be of "High" severity because the issue affects nearly all stakers and results in a partial loss of rewards.    ## Proof of Concept Let's first look at the `multiplier` calculation from the [documentation](https://wiki.mute.io/mute/mute-switch/amplifier):    ![multiplier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118979828/229354171-7308e84d-435a-4e41-989d-5c37b5ad0faa.png)  ![multiplier_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118979828/229354217-2277ae01-8088-479a-8691-6bf4ad62387a.png)  The example calculation shows that the amount that is added to $APY_{base}$ (5%) is scaled linearly by the $\dfrac{user_{dmute}}{pool_{rewards}}$ ratio which I called `tokenRatio` above.    This means that when a user increases his `tokenRatio` from say `0` to `0.1` he gets the same additional reward as when he increases the `tokenRatio` from say `0.9` to `1`.    Let's now look at how the reward and thereby the `multiplier` is calculated in the code.    The first step is to calculate the `multiplier` which happens in the `MuteAmplifier.calculateMultiplier` function:    [Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L473-L499)   ```solidity function calculateMultiplier(address account, bool enforce) public view returns (uint256) {     require(account != address(0), "MuteAmplifier::calculateMultiplier: missing account");       uint256 accountDTokenValue;       // zkSync block.number = L1 batch number. This at times is the same for a few minutes. To avoid breaking the call to the dMute contract     // we take the previous block into account     uint256 staked_block =  _userStakedBlock[account] == block.number ? _userStakedBlock[account] - 1 : _userStakedBlock[account];       if(staked_block != 0 && enforce)         accountDTokenValue = IDMute(dToken).getPriorVotes(account, staked_block);     else         accountDTokenValue = IDMute(dToken).getPriorVotes(account, block.number - 1);       if(accountDTokenValue == 0){         return _stakeDivisor;     }       uint256 stakeDifference = _stakeDivisor.sub(10 ** 18);       // ratio of dMute holdings to pool     uint256 tokenRatio = accountDTokenValue.mul(10**18).div(totalRewards);       stakeDifference = stakeDifference.mul(clamp_value(tokenRatio, 10**18)).div(10**18);       return _stakeDivisor.sub(stakeDifference); } ```  The `multiplier` that is returned is then used to calculate the `reward`:    [Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L371)   ```solidity reward = lpTokenOut.mul(_totalWeight.sub(_userWeighted[account])).div(calculateMultiplier(account, true)); ```  Let's write the formula in a more readable form:    $\dfrac{lpTokenOut * weightDifference}{stakeDivisor - tokenRatio * (stakeDivisor - 1)}$  $stakeDivisor$ can be any number $>=1$ and has the purpose of determining the percentage of rewards a user with $tokenRatio=0$ gets.    For the sake of this argument we can assume that all numbers except $tokenRatio$ are constant.    Let's just say $stakeDivisor=2$ which means that a user with $tokenRatio=0§ would receive $\dfrac{1}{2}=50\%$ of the maximum rewards.    Further let's say that $lpTokenOut * weightDifference = 1$, so 100% of the possible rewards would be $1$.    We can then write the formula like this:    $\dfrac{1}{2 - tokenRatio}$  So let's compare the calculation from the documentation with the calculation from the code by looking at a plot:    ![functions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118979828/229356435-49bcba3c-968e-4613-aded-89c2d0145905.png)  ![plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118979828/229355365-9236bf2c-6bd5-4732-97b9-2d008043b7cc.png)    **x-axis: tokenRatio**   **y-axis: percentage of maximum rewards**     We can see that the green curve is non-linear and below the blue curve.    So the rewards as calculated in the code are too low.    ## Tools Used VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I recommend to change the reward calculation to this:    $(lpTokenOut * weightDifference) * (percentage_{min} + clamp(\dfrac{user_{dmute}}{pool_{rewards}},1) * (1 - percentage_{min}))$  Instead of setting the `stakeDivisor` upon initialization, the `percentageMin` should be set which can be in the interval `[0,1e18]`.

The contract does protect tokens that ARE meant to be in the contract by not allowing them to be transferred:    [Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L180-L194)   ```solidity function rescueTokens(address tokenToRescue, address to, uint256 amount) external virtual onlyOwner nonReentrant {     if (tokenToRescue == lpToken) {         require(amount <= IERC20(lpToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(_totalStakeLpToken),             "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that Token-Eth belongs to stakers"         );     } else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {         if (totalStakers > 0) {             require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards)),                 "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"             );         }     }       IERC20(tokenToRescue).transfer(to, amount); } ```  You can see that `lpToken` and `muteToken` cannot be transferred unless there is an excess amount beyond what is needed by the contract.    So stakers can be sure that not even the contract `owner` can mess with their stakes.    The issue is that `lpToken` and `muteToken` are not the only tokens that need to stay in the contract.    There is also the `fee0` token and the `fee1` token.    So what can happen is that the `owner` can withdraw `fee0` or `fee1` tokens and users cannot [`payout`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L275-L311) rewards or [`withdraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L228-L270) their stake because the transfer of `fee0` / `fee1` tokens reverts due to the missing balance.    Users can of course send `fee0` / `fee1` tokens to the contract to restore the balance. But this is not intended and certainly leaves the user worse off.    ## Proof of Concept Assume that when an update occurs via the `update` modifier there is an amount of `fee0` tokens claimed:    [Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L88-L121)   ```solidity     modifier update() {         if (_mostRecentValueCalcTime == 0) {             _mostRecentValueCalcTime = firstStakeTime;         }           uint256 totalCurrentStake = totalStake();           if (totalCurrentStake > 0 && _mostRecentValueCalcTime < endTime) {             uint256 value = 0;             uint256 sinceLastCalc = block.timestamp.sub(_mostRecentValueCalcTime);             uint256 perSecondReward = totalRewards.div(endTime.sub(firstStakeTime));               if (block.timestamp < endTime) {                 value = sinceLastCalc.mul(perSecondReward);             } else {                 uint256 sinceEndTime = block.timestamp.sub(endTime);                 value = (sinceLastCalc.sub(sinceEndTime)).mul(perSecondReward);             }               _totalWeight = _totalWeight.add(value.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));               _mostRecentValueCalcTime = block.timestamp;               (uint fee0, uint fee1) = IMuteSwitchPairDynamic(lpToken).claimFees();               _totalWeightFee0 = _totalWeightFee0.add(fee0.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));             _totalWeightFee1 = _totalWeightFee1.add(fee1.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));               totalFees0 = totalFees0.add(fee0);             totalFees1 = totalFees1.add(fee1);         }           _;     } ```  We can see that `_totalWeightFee0` is updated such that when a user's rewards are calculated the `fee0` tokens will be paid out to the user.    What happens now is that the `owner` calls `rescueTokens` which transfers the `fee0` tokens out of the contract.    We can see that when the `fee0` to be paid out to the user is calculated in the `_applyReward` function, the calculation is solely based on `_totalWeightFee0` and does not take into account if the `fee0` tokens still exist in the contract.    [Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L379)   ```solidity fee0 = lpTokenOut.mul(_totalWeightFee0.sub(_userWeightedFee0[account])).div(10**18); ```  So when the `fee0` tokens are attempted to be transferred to the user that calls `payout` or `withdraw`, the transfer reverts due to insufficient balance.    ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `MuteAmplifier.rescueTokens` function should check that only excess `fee0` / `fee1` tokens can be paid out. Such that tokens that will be paid out to stakers need to stay in the contract.

There are two functions in the `dMute` contract that iterate over all items in this array ([`RedeemTo`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/dao/dMute.sol#L90-L129) and [`GetUnderlyingTokens`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/dao/dMute.sol#L135-L139)).    Thereby if the attacker pushes sufficient items to the array of a user, he can make the above two functions revert since they require more Gas than the Block Gas Limit.    According to the `zkSync` documentation the block gas limit is currently 12.5 million ([Link](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech/#:~:text=With%20the%20current%20block%20gas,can%20process%20over%202000%20TPS.)).    The attack is of "High" impact for the `RedeemTo` function since this function needs to succeed in order for the user to redeem his `MUTE` tokens.    The user might have a lot of `MUTE` tokens locked and the attacker can make it such that they can never be redeemed. The attacker cannot gain a profit from this attack, i.e. he cannot steal anything, but due to the possibility of this attack users will not lock their tokens, especially not a lot of them.    This is all the more severe because the `MuteBond` and `MuteAmplifier` contracts also rely on the locking functionality so those upstream features can also not be used securely.    In the Mitigation section I will show how the `GetUnderlyingTokens` function can be made to run in $O(1)$ time instead of $O(lock\:array\:length)$.    The `RedeemTo` function can be made to run in $O(indexes\:array\:length)$ instead of $O(lock\:array\:length)$. The length of the indexes array is determined by the user and simply tells how many locked items to redeem. So there is no possibility of DOS.    ## Proof of Concept Note: a redemption costs `~7 million Gas` when 1000 items are locked. So when running on the `zkSync` network even 2000 items should be enough. The hardhat tests use a local Ethereum network instead of a fork of `zkSync` so in order to hit `30 million Gas` (which is the Ethereum block gas limit) we need to add more items to the queue.    You can add the following test to the `dao.ts` test file:   ```javascript it('Lock DOS', async function () {     var tx = await muteToken.approve(dMuteToken.address, MaxUint256)       let lock_time_week = new BigNumber(60 * 60 * 24 * 7);     let max_lock = lock_time_week.times(52);      let lock_amount = new BigNumber(1).times(Math.pow(10,2))      // @audit fill up array     for(let i=0;i<5000;i++) {         tx = await dMuteToken.LockTo(lock_amount.toFixed(0), lock_time_week.toFixed(),owner.address)     }      await time.increase(60 * 60 * 24 * 7)      tx = await dMuteToken.Redeem([0]) }) ``` It adds `5000` lock items to the array of the `owner` address. When the `owner` then tries to redeem even a single lock the transaction fails due to an out of gas error.    (Sometimes it reverts with `TransactionExecutionError: Transaction ran out of gas` error sometimes it reverts due to timeout. If you try a few times it should revert with the out of gas error.)    The amount of `MUTE` tokens that the attacker loses to execute this attack is negligible. As you can see in the test `100 Wei * 5000 = 500,000 Wei` is sufficient (There needs to be some amount of `MUTE` such that the `LockTo` function does not revert). The only real cost comes down to Gas costs which are cheap on `zkSync`.    ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps First for the `GetUnderlyingTokens` function: The contract should keep track of underlying token amounts for each user in a mapping that is updated with every lock / redeem call. The `GetUnderlyingTokens` function then simply needs to return the value from this mapping.    Secondly, fixing the issue with the `RedeemTo` function is a bit harder. I discussed this with the sponsor and I have been told they don't want this function to require an already sorted `lock_index` array as parameter. So the `lock_index` array can contain indexes in random order.    This means it must be sorted internally. Depending on the expected length of the `lock_index` array different sorting algorithms may be used. I recommend to use an algorithm like [quick sort](https://gist.github.com/subhodi/b3b86cc13ad2636420963e692a4d896f) to allow for many indexes to be specified at once.    I will use a placeholder for the sorting algorithm for now so the sponsor may decide which one to use.    The proposed fixes for both functions are then like this:   ```diff diff --git a/contracts/dao/dMute.sol b/contracts/dao/dMute.sol index 59f95b7..11d21fb 100644 --- a/contracts/dao/dMute.sol +++ b/contracts/dao/dMute.sol @@ -18,6 +18,7 @@ contract dMute is dSoulBound {      }        mapping(address => UserLockInfo[]) public _userLocks; +    mapping(address => uint256) public _amounts;        uint private unlocked = 1;   @@ -79,6 +80,7 @@ contract dMute is dSoulBound {          _mint(to, tokens_to_mint);            _userLocks[to].push(UserLockInfo(_amount, block.timestamp.add(_lock_time), tokens_to_mint)); +        _amounts[to] = _amounts[to] + _amount;            emit LockEvent(to, _amount, tokens_to_mint, _lock_time);      } @@ -91,8 +93,14 @@ contract dMute is dSoulBound {          uint256 total_to_redeem = 0;          uint256 total_to_burn = 0;   -        for(uint256 i; i < lock_index.length; i++){ -          uint256 index = lock_index[i]; +        /////////////////////////////////////////////// +        //                                           // +        // sort lock_index array in ascending order // +        //                                          // +        ////////////////////////////////////////////// + +        for(uint256 i = lock_index.length; i > 0; i--){ +          uint256 index = lock_index[i - 1];            UserLockInfo memory lock_info = _userLocks[msg.sender][index];              require(block.timestamp >= lock_info.time, "dMute::Redeem: INSUFFICIENT_LOCK_TIME"); @@ -102,23 +110,14 @@ contract dMute is dSoulBound {            total_to_redeem = total_to_redeem.add(lock_info.amount);            total_to_burn = total_to_burn.add(lock_info.tokens_minted);   -          _userLocks[msg.sender][index] = UserLockInfo(0,0,0); +          _userLocks[msg.sender][index] = _userLocks[msg.sender][_userLocks[msg.sender].length - 1]; +          _userLocks[msg.sender].pop();          }            require(total_to_redeem > 0, "dMute::Lock: INSUFFICIENT_REDEEM_AMOUNT");          require(total_to_burn > 0, "dMute::Lock: INSUFFICIENT_BURN_AMOUNT");   - -        for(uint256 i = _userLocks[msg.sender].length; i > 0; i--){ -          UserLockInfo memory lock_info = _userLocks[msg.sender][i - 1]; - -          // recently redeemed lock, destroy it -          if(lock_info.time == 0){ -            _userLocks[msg.sender][i - 1] = _userLocks[msg.sender][_userLocks[msg.sender].length - 1]; -            _userLocks[msg.sender].pop(); -          } -        } - +        _amounts[msg.sender] = _amounts[msg.sender] + total_to_redeem;          //redeem tokens to user          IERC20(MuteToken).transfer(to, total_to_redeem);          //burn dMute @@ -133,8 +132,6 @@ contract dMute is dSoulBound {      }        function GetUnderlyingTokens(address account) public view returns(uint256 amount) { -        for(uint256 i; i < _userLocks[account].length; i++){ -          amount = amount.add(_userLocks[account][i].amount); -        } +        return _amounts[account];      }  } ```

There is a division-before-multiplication precision loss issue for update().  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  The update() function has a division-before-multiplication precision loss issue.   First, the calculation of ``perSecondReward`` uses a division:  ```javascript uint256 perSecondReward = totalRewards.div(endTime.sub(firstStakeTime)); ```  Then, the calculation of ``value`` uses a multiplication. ```javascript if (block.timestamp < endTime) {                 value = sinceLastCalc.mul(perSecondReward);             } else {                 uint256 sinceEndTime = block.timestamp.sub(endTime);                 value = (sinceLastCalc.sub(sinceEndTime)).mul(perSecondReward);             } ```  Suppose that the total reward time is one year = 31,536,000 seconds, then the precision loss could be up to 31,536,000, which is significant for ``perSecondReward``.   ## Tools Used VScode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the multiplication-after-division pattern  Mitigation: use multiplication-before-division instead ```diff modifier update() {         if (_mostRecentValueCalcTime == 0) {             _mostRecentValueCalcTime = firstStakeTime;         }          uint256 totalCurrentStake = totalStake();          if (totalCurrentStake > 0 && _mostRecentValueCalcTime < endTime) {             uint256 value = 0;             uint256 sinceLastCalc = block.timestamp.sub(_mostRecentValueCalcTime); -            uint256 perSecondReward = totalRewards.div(endTime.sub(firstStakeTime)); +            uint256 rewardPeriod = endTime.sub(firstStakeTime);              if (block.timestamp < endTime) { -                value = sinceLastCalc.mul(perSecondReward); +                 value = sinceLastCalc.mul(totalRewards).div(rewardPeriod);             } else {                 uint256 sinceEndTime = block.timestamp.sub(endTime); -                value = (sinceLastCalc.sub(sinceEndTime)).mul(perSecondReward); +                value = (sinceLastCalc.sub(sinceEndTime)).mul(totalRewards).div(rewardPeriod);             }              _totalWeight = _totalWeight.add(value.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));              _mostRecentValueCalcTime = block.timestamp;              (uint fee0, uint fee1) = IMuteSwitchPairDynamic(lpToken).claimFees();              _totalWeightFee0 = _totalWeightFee0.add(fee0.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));             _totalWeightFee1 = _totalWeightFee1.add(fee1.mul(10**18).div(totalCurrentStake));              totalFees0 = totalFees0.add(fee0);             totalFees1 = totalFees1.add(fee1);         }          _;     } ```
