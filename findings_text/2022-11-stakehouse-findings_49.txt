This bug causes a revert in: 1. `WithdrawLP` - `GiantMevAndFeesPool` 2. `WithdrawLP` - `GiantSavETHVaultPool` 3. `WithdrawDETH` - `GiantSavETHVaultPool`  A hacker can prevent a user from receiving dETH when users are eligible and guaranteed to receive it through their stake.  This causes a liquidity crunch as the only funds that are possible to withdraw are ETH. There is not enough ETH in the giant pools to facilitate a large withdraw as ETH is staked for LPTokens and dETH.  The giant pools will become insolvent to returning ETH, dETH or vault LPTokens.  ## Proof of Concept  Both `WithdrawLP` and `WithdrawDETH` act in a similar way: 1. loop LPtokens received for withdraw 2. Check user has enough Giant LP tokens to burn and pool has enough vault LP to give. 3. Check that a day has passed since user has interacted with Giant LP Token 4. burn tokens 5. send tokens  Example of `WithdrawDETH`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantSavETHVaultPool.sol#L66 ```     function withdrawDETH(         address[] calldata _savETHVaults,         LPToken[][] calldata _lpTokens,         uint256[][] calldata _amounts     ) external {         uint256 numOfVaults = _savETHVaults.length;         require(numOfVaults > 0, "Empty arrays");         require(numOfVaults == _lpTokens.length, "Inconsistent arrays");         require(numOfVaults == _amounts.length, "Inconsistent arrays");          // Firstly capture current dETH balance and see how much has been deposited after the loop         uint256 dETHReceivedFromAllSavETHVaults = getDETH().balanceOf(address(this));         for (uint256 i; i < numOfVaults; ++i) {             SavETHVault vault = SavETHVault(_savETHVaults[i]);              // Simultaneously check the status of LP tokens held by the vault and the giant LP balance of the user             for (uint256 j; j < _lpTokens[i].length; ++j) {                 LPToken token = _lpTokens[i][j];                 uint256 amount = _amounts[i][j];                  // Check the user has enough giant LP to burn and that the pool has enough savETH vault LP                 _assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP(token, amount);                  require(vault.isDETHReadyForWithdrawal(address(token)), "dETH is not ready for withdrawal");                  // Giant LP is burned 1:1 with LPs from sub-networks                 require(lpTokenETH.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "User does not own enough LP");                  // Burn giant LP from user before sending them dETH                 lpTokenETH.burn(msg.sender, amount);                  emit LPBurnedForDETH(address(token), msg.sender, amount);             }              // Ask             vault.burnLPTokens(_lpTokens[i], _amounts[i]);         }          // Calculate how much dETH has been received from burning         dETHReceivedFromAllSavETHVaults = getDETH().balanceOf(address(this)) - dETHReceivedFromAllSavETHVaults;          // Send giant LP holder dETH owed         getDETH().transfer(msg.sender, dETHReceivedFromAllSavETHVaults);     } ```  The bug is in `_assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP` in the last require that checks that a day has passed since the user has interacted with Giant LP Token: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantPoolBase.sol#L93 ```     function _assertUserHasEnoughGiantLPToClaimVaultLP(LPToken _token, uint256 _amount) internal view {         require(_amount >= MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT, "Invalid amount");         require(_token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Pool does not own specified LP");         require(lpTokenETH.lastInteractedTimestamp(msg.sender) + 1 days < block.timestamp, "Too new");     } ```  The condition `lpTokenETH.lastInteractedTimestamp(msg.sender) + 1 days < block.timestamp` can be set to fail by the hacker. The hacker  transfers 0 `lpTokenETH` tokens to  `msg.sender`. This transfer will update the `lastInteractedTimestamp` to now.  The above can be done once a day or on-demand by front-running the withdraw commands.  `_afterTokenTransfer` in `GiantLP.sol`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantLP.sol#L43 ```     function _afterTokenTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal override {         lastInteractedTimestamp[_from] = block.timestamp;         lastInteractedTimestamp[_to] = block.timestamp;         if (address(transferHookProcessor) != address(0)) ITransferHookProcessor(transferHookProcessor).afterTokenTransfer(_from, _to, _amount);     } ``` ### Foundry POC  The POC will show how a hacker prevents a user from receiving dETH although they are eligible to receive it.
