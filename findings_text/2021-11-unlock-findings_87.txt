# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  If calling `transferFrom` with `_from == _recipient`, the key will get destroyed (meaning the key will be set as expired and set the owner's key to be 0).  ## Impact A key manager or approved might accidently destroy user's token.  Note: this requires user error and so I'm not sure if this is a valid finding. However, few things make me think that it is valid: - Unlock protocol checks for transfer to 0-address, so some input validation is there - Since other entities other than the owner can be allowed to transfer owner's token, it might be best to make sure such accidental mistake could not happen. - This scenario manifests a unique and probably unintended behavior   ## Proof of Concept By following `transferFrom`'s execution: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinTransfer.sol#L109:#L166 One can see that in the case where `_from == _recipient` with a valid key: - The function will deduct transfer fee from the key - The function will incorrectly add more time to the key's expiration ([L151](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinTransfer.sol#L151)) - The function will expire and reset the key ([L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/mixins/MixinTransfer.sol#L155:#L158)) Therefore, the user will lose his key without getting a refund.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a require statement in the beginning of `transferFrom`: `require(_from != _recipient, 'TRANSFER_TO_SELF');`
