# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24-L35   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  If the price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, a malicious user can use this to liquidate a healthy position.  An attacker can setup a monitoring of the used Oracle feed and act on observing a price outbreak (for example, zero price, which is usually a subject to filtration), liquidating the trader position which is perfectly healthy otherwise, obtaining the collateral with a substantial discount at the expense of the trader.  The same is for a flash crash kind of scenario, i.e. a price outbreak of any nature will allow for non-market liquidation by an attacker, who has the incentives to setup such a monitoring and act on such an outbreak, knowing that it will not be smoothed or filtered out, allowing a liquidation at a non-market price that happen to be printed in the Oracle feed  ## Proof of Concept  Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice just passes on the latest Oracle answer, not checking it anyhow:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24-L35  It is then used in liquidation triggers providing isLiquidatable and _getLiquidationInfo functions:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L249  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L465  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a non-zero Oracle price check, possibly add an additional Oracle feed information usage to control that the price is fresh. Please consult the Chainlink for that as OCR introduction might have changed the state of the art approach (i.e. whether and how to use latestRoundData returned data):  https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/  Regarding any price spikes it is straightforward to construct a mitigation mechanics for such cases, so the system will be affected by sustainable price movements only.  As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it's worth adding some complexity to the implementation.  One of the approaches is to track both current and TWAP prices, and condition all state changing actions, including liquidations, on the current price being within a threshold of the TWAP one. If the liquidation margin level is conservative enough and TWAP window is small enough this is safe for the overall stability of the system, while providing substantial mitigation mechanics by allowing state changes on the locally calm market only.  Another approach is to introduce time delay between liquidation request and actual liquidation. Again, conservative enough margin level plus small enough delay keeps the system safe, while requiring that market conditions allow for liquidation both at request time and at execution time provides ample filtration against price feed outbreaks
