# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There can be issues with troubleshooting and system usage analytics.  ## Proof of Concept  E512 error code is meant for 'Debt is greater than max Debt' situation:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/ErrorCodes.md#e512   In Mint library E512 is used for collateral max value check:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L482   Also, code E513, that is to be used for collateral check above, is also used for max asset increase check, which doesn’t seem to have an error code of its own:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L481  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L643   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change Mint line 482 error code to be 513: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/ErrorCodes.md#e513  Possibly add an error code for max asset check for Mint lines 481 and 643.
