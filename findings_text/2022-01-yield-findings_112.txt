# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The _calcRewardIntegral function casts intermediate reward values from uint256 to uint128 and vice versa several times. Because OpenZeppelin SafeCast is not used, casting from uint256 to uint128 may overflow if a large reward value is being calculate. This overflow could result in users receiving less rewards than they are owed.  ## Proof of Concept  There are 4 uint128 casting operations and 2 uint256 casting operations [in the _calcRewardIntegral function of ConvexStakingWrapper.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L222-L253).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Because reward values are an important part of this protocol, use the OpenZeppelin SafeCast library to prevent unexpected overflows when casting. SafeMath and Solidity 0.8.* handles overflows for basic math operations but not for casting.
