This can be quite material as owner choice for the whole voting power is being reset this way to favor the old delegate.  ## Proof of Concept  _burn() can be invoked by anyone on the behalf of any `contributor`:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/Crowdfund.sol#L167-L171  ```solidity     function burn(address payable contributor)         public     {         return _burn(contributor, getCrowdfundLifecycle(), party);     } ```  It mints the governance NFT for the contributor whenever he has voting power:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/Crowdfund.sol#L471-L485  ```solidity         if (votingPower > 0) {             // Get the address to delegate voting power to. If null, delegate to self.             address delegate = delegationsByContributor[contributor];             if (delegate == address(0)) {                 // Delegate can be unset for the split recipient if they never                 // contribute. Self-delegate if this occurs.                 delegate = contributor;             }             // Mint governance NFT for the contributor.             party_.mint(                 contributor,                 votingPower,                 delegate             );         } ```  Now mint() calls _adjustVotingPower() with a new delegate, redirecting all the intristic power, not just one for that id, ignoring the delegation the `owner` might already have:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L120-L133  ```solidity     function mint(         address owner,         uint256 votingPower,         address delegate     )         external         onlyMinter         onlyDelegateCall     {         uint256 tokenId = ++tokenCount;         votingPowerByTokenId[tokenId] = votingPower;         _adjustVotingPower(owner, votingPower.safeCastUint256ToInt192(), delegate);         _mint(owner, tokenId);     } ```  I.e. Bob the contributor can take part in the crowdfunding with contribute() with small `0.01 ETH` stake, stating Mike as the delegate of his choice with `contribute(Mike, ...)`:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/Crowdfund.sol#L189-L208  ```solidity     /// @param delegate The address to delegate to for the governance phase.     /// @param gateData Data to pass to the gatekeeper to prove eligibility.     function contribute(address delegate, bytes memory gateData)         public         payable     {         _contribute(             msg.sender,             msg.value.safeCastUint256ToUint96(),             delegate,             // We cannot use `address(this).balance - msg.value` as the previous             // total contributions in case someone forces (suicides) ETH into this             // contract. This wouldn't be such a big deal for open crowdfunds             // but private ones (protected by a gatekeeper) could be griefed             // because it would ultimately result in governance power that             // is unattributed/unclaimable, meaning that party will never be             // able to reach 100% consensus.             totalContributions,             gateData         ); ```  Then crowdfund was a success, party was created, and Melany, who also participated, per off-chain arrangement has transferred to Bob a `tokenId` with big voting power (say it is `100 ETH` and the majority of voting power):  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L146-L155  ```solidity     /// @inheritdoc ERC721     function safeTransferFrom(address owner, address to, uint256 tokenId)         public         override         onlyDelegateCall     {         // Transfer voting along with token.         _transferVotingPower(owner, to, votingPowerByTokenId[tokenId]);         super.safeTransferFrom(owner, to, tokenId);     } ```  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L879-L887  ```solidity     // Transfers some voting power of `from` to `to`. The total voting power of     // their respective delegates will be updated as well.     function _transferVotingPower(address from, address to, uint256 power)         internal     {         int192 powerI192 = power.safeCastUint256ToInt192();         _adjustVotingPower(from, -powerI192, address(0));         _adjustVotingPower(to, powerI192, address(0));     } ```  Bob don't care about his early small contribution and focuses on managing the one that Melany transferred instead as he simply don't need the voting power from the initial `0.01 ETH` contribution anymore.  The actual delegate for Bob at the moment is Linda, while his business with Mike is over. So Bob sets her address there, calling `delegateVotingPower(Linda)`:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L448-L454  ```solidity     /// @notice Pledge your intrinsic voting power to a new delegate, removing it from     ///         the old one (if any).     /// @param delegate The address to delegating voting power to.     function delegateVotingPower(address delegate) external onlyDelegateCall {         _adjustVotingPower(msg.sender, 0, delegate);         emit VotingPowerDelegated(msg.sender, delegate);     } ```  Now, Mike can unilaterally delegate to himself the whole voting power with `burn(Bob)` as mint() just resets the delegation with the previously recorded value with `_adjustVotingPower(owner, votingPower.safeCastUint256ToInt192(), delegate)`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The issue is that mint() always assumes that it is the first operation for the `owner`, which might not always be the case.  Consider not changing the delegate on `mint` if one is set already:  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L120-L133  ```solidity     function mint(         address owner,         uint256 votingPower,         address delegate     )         external         onlyMinter         onlyDelegateCall     {         uint256 tokenId = ++tokenCount;         votingPowerByTokenId[tokenId] = votingPower; +       address actualDelegate = <get_current_delegate>; +       if (actualDelegate == address(0)) actualDelegate = delegate; -       _adjustVotingPower(owner, votingPower.safeCastUint256ToInt192(), delegate); +       _adjustVotingPower(owner, votingPower.safeCastUint256ToInt192(), actualDelegate);         _mint(owner, tokenId);     } ```  More complicated version might be the one with tracking the most recent request via contribute()/delegateVotingPower() calls timestamps. Here we assume that the delegateVotingPower() holds more information as in the majority of practical cases it occurs after initial contribute() and it is a direct voluntary call from the owner.
