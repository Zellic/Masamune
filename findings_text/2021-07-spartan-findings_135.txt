# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The token argument used in CreatePool event emit of createPoolADD() should really be _token so that WBNB address is logged in the event instead of zero address when token == 0. Logging a zero address could confuse off-chain user interfaces because it is treated as a burn address by convention.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L60  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L49   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use _token instead of token in event emit.
