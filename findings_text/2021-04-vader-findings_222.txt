# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `_deposit` function increases the member's _weight_ by `_weight = iUTILS(UTILS()).calcValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).TOKEN(), _amount);` which is the swap output amount when trading the deposited underlying synth amount.  Notice that anyone can create synths of custom tokens by calling `Pools.deploySynth(customToken)`.  Therefore an attacker can deposit valueless custom tokens and inflate their member weight as follows:  1. Create a custom token and issue lots of tokens to the attacker 2. Create synth of this token 3. Add liquidity for the `TOKEN <> BASE` pair by providing a single wei of `TOKEN` and `10^18` BASE tokens. This makes the `TOKEN` price very expensive. 4. Mint some synths by paying BASE to the pool 5. Deposit the fake synth, `_weight` will be very high because the token pool price is so high.  Call `harvest(realSynth)` with a synth with actual value. This will increase the synth balance and it can be withdrawn later.  ## Impact  Anyone can inflate their member weight through depositing a custom synth and earn almost all vault rewards by calling `harvest(realSynth)` with a valuable "real" synth. The rewards are distributed pro rata to the member weight which is independent of the actual synth deposited.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The `calcReward` function completely disregards the `synth` parameter which seems odd. Think about making the rewards based on the actual synths deposited instead of a "global" weight tracker. Alternatively, whitelist certain synths that count toward the weight, or don't let anyone create synths.
