# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  # treasury is vulnerable to sandwich attack.   ## Impact There's a permissionless function `veCRVlock` in MochiTreasury. Since everyone can trigger this function, the attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds. [MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/treasury/MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94)  Attackers can possibly steal all the funds in the treasury. I consider this is a high-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept [MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/treasury/MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94)  Here's an exploit pattern 1. Flashloan and buy CRV the uniswap pool 2. Trigger `veCRVlock()` 3. The treasury buys CRV at a very high price. 4. Sell CRV and pay back the loan.  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend to add `onlyOwner` modifier.
