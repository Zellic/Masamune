# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/marketplace/ERC5095.sol#L100   # Vulnerability details  ERC5095's `redeem`/`withdraw` allows an ERC20-approved account to redeem user's tokens, but does not update the allowance after burning.  ## Impact User Mal can burn more tokens than Alice allowed him to. He can set himself to be the receiver of the underlying, therefore Alice will lose funds.  ## Proof of Concept [`withdraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/marketplace/ERC5095.sol#L100) and [`redeem`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/marketplace/ERC5095.sol#L116) functions check that the msg.sender has enough approvals to redeem the tokens: ```             require(_allowance[holder][msg.sender] >= underlyingAmount, 'not enough approvals'); ``` But they do not update the allowances. They then call `authRedeem`, which also does not update the allowances. Therefore, an approved user could "re-use his approval" again and again and redeem whole of approver's funds to himself.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Update the allowances upon spending.
