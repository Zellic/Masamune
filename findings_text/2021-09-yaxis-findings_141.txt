# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact During the `_harvest` function in NativeStrategyCurve3Crv.sol, there's a call to `_deposit()` only `if (balanceOfWant() > 0)`. This if-statement can be removed since `_deposit` calculates again `balanceOfWant()` and makes the same check. This way the function saves a `.balanceOf` call.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/strategies/NativeStrategyCurve3Crv.sol#L123  ## Tools Used editor
