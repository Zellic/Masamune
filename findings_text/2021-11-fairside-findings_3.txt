# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Increased gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  In a number of places a `keccak("string")` expression is assigned to a `constant` variable. Due to how `constant` variables are implemented this results in the hash being recomputed each time that the variable is used, spending the gas necessary to perform this action.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/20c68793f48ee2678508b9d3a1bae917c007b712/contracts/dao/FairSideDAO.sol#L43-L49  If these variables were to be `immutable` this hash is calculated once at deploy time and then the result is saved to be used directly at runtime rather than recalculating, saving the cost of hashing.  See: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change all `constant` hashes to be `immutable`
