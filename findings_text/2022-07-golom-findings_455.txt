Since this is the second transaction in the same block the if statement in the code block above executes and stores `_delegatedTokenIds` in `memory oldCheckpoint`, thus not persisting the array of `_delegatedTokenIds` in the checkpoint.  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Define the `oldCheckpoint` variable as a `storage` pointer:  `Checkpoint storage oldCheckpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];`
