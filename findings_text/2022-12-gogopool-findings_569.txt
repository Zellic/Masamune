According to the implementation, the possible states and transitions are as below.  ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/ASL235O.jpg)  The Rialto may call `recreateMinipool` when the minipool is in states of `Withdrawable, Finished, Error, Canceled`. The problem is that these four states are not the same in the sense of holding the node operator's AVAX. If the state flow has followed `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Error`, all the AVAX are still in the vault. If the state flow has followed `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Error->Finished` (last transition by `withdrawMinipoolFunds`), all the AVAX are sent back to the node operator. So if the Rialto calls `recreateMinipool` for the second case, there are no AVAX deposited from the node operator at that point but there can be AVAX from other mini pools in the state of Prelaunch. Because there are AVAX in the vault (and these are not managed per staker base), `recreatePool` results in a new mini pool in `Prelaunch` state and it is further possible to go through the normal flow `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Withdrawable->Finished`. And the other minipool that was waiting for launch will not be able to launch because the vault is lack of AVAX.  Below is a test case written to show an example.  ```solidity function testAudit() public {   uint256 duration = 2 weeks;   uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;   uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;   uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;   uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;    // Node Op 1   vm.startPrank(nodeOp);   ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);   staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);   MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(     depositAmt,     avaxAssignmentRequest,     duration   );   vm.stopPrank();    // Node Op 2   address nodeOp2 = getActorWithTokens("nodeOp2", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);   vm.startPrank(nodeOp2);   ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);   staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);   MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp2 = createMinipool(     depositAmt,     avaxAssignmentRequest,     duration   );   vm.stopPrank();    int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);    address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);   vm.prank(liqStaker1);   ggAVAX.depositAVAX{ value: MAX_AMT }();    // Node Op 1: Prelaunch->Launched   vm.prank(address(rialto));   minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);    bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");   vm.prank(address(rialto));   // Node Op 1: Launched->Staking   minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);    vm.prank(address(rialto));   // Node Op 1: Staking->Error   bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";   minipoolMgr.recordStakingError{ value: validationAmt }(mp1.nodeID, errorCode);    // There are 2*depositAmt AVAX in the pool manager   assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt * 2);    // Node Op 1: Staking->Finished withdrawing funds   vm.prank(nodeOp);   minipoolMgr.withdrawMinipoolFunds(mp1.nodeID);   assertEq(staking.getAVAXStake(nodeOp), 0);   mp1 = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);   assertEq(mp1.status, uint256(MinipoolStatus.Finished));    // Rialto recreate a minipool for the mp1   vm.prank(address(rialto));   // Node Op 1: Finished -> Prelaunch   minipoolMgr.recreateMinipool(mp1.nodeID);    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);    // Node Op 1: Prelaunch -> Launched   vm.prank(address(rialto));   minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);    // Node Op 1: Launched -> Staking   vm.prank(address(rialto));   minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);    assertEq(staking.getAVAXStake(nodeOp), 0);   assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(nodeOp), depositAmt);   assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssignedHighWater(nodeOp), depositAmt);    // now try to launch the second operator's pool, it will fail with InsufficientContractBalance   vm.prank(address(rialto));   vm.expectRevert(Vault.InsufficientContractBalance.selector);   minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp2.nodeID); }  ```  ## Tools Used  Manual Review, Foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Make sure to keep the node operator's deposit status the same for all states that can lead to the same state. For example, for all states that can transition to Prelaunch, make sure to send the AVAX back to the user and get them back on the call `recreateMiniPool()`.
