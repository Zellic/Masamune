# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact According to https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt#high-level-overview-of-the-malt-protocol > When the Malt price TWAP drops below a specified threshold (eg 2% below peg) then the protocol will revert any transaction that tries to remove Malt from the AMM pool (ie buying Malt or removing liquidity). Users wanting to remove liquidity can still do so via the UniswapHandler contract that is whitelisted in recovery mode.  However, in https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L236 liquidity removed is directly sent to msg.sender, which would revert if it is not whitelisted https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/PoolTransferVerification.sol#L53  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Liquidity should be removed to UniswapHandler contract, then the proceed is sent to msg.sender
