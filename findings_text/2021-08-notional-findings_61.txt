# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details As the return value of `ERC1155.balanceOf` was changed to a signed integer, the `nERC1155Interface` does not implement the `ERC1155` interface and the `supportsInterface` call will return false if people call it with the actual `ERC1155` interface ID.  ## Impact Not all users of the contract might care about the `balance` function and call `supportsInterface` with the original EIP1155 interface. The contract will still deny the   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It is indeed debatable if this contract should be considered implementing ERC1155 and what the correct return value of `supportsInterface(ERC1155.interface)` should be for compatibility. Users need to be aware that this contract is not standard compliant and the `supportsInterface` call will fail.
