# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Low-level calls like staticcall return true even if the account called is non-existent (per EVM design) so this hack in YieldSourcePrizePool constructor will not work in certain cases:         // A hack to determine whether it's an actual yield source         (bool succeeded, ) = address(_yieldSource).staticcall(             abi.encodePacked(_yieldSource.depositToken.selector)         );  You can try to pass an EOA address and see that it will return true.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Account existence must be checked prior to calling. A similar issue was submitted in a previous contest and assigned a severity of low, you can find more details here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-basedloans-findings/issues/16
