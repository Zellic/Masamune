# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  It might be operationally easier (eg. reading permissions via etherscan, saves a few seconds having to search for the bytes32 constant and copy its value) to take in the role of type `string` instead of `bytes32`. It also has an added benefit of overloading the `hasRole()` function, where overriding was desired.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Perhaps add it as an additional function to avoid having to change all `treasury.checkPermissions()` function calls (since the role input has to be modified too).  ```jsx // TODO: add to interface function hasRole(string memory role, address account)  external  view  override  returns (bool) {  bytes32 _role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(role));  return AccessControl.hasRole(_role, account); } ```
