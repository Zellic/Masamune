This is part of the `setContract()` code that handels `stakeGmx`: ```         if (c == Contracts.StakedGmx) {             // Set the current stakedGmx (pending change) approval amount to 0             gmx.safeApprove(address(stakedGmx), 0);              stakedGmx = RewardTracker(contractAddress);              // Approve the new stakedGmx contract address allowance to the max             gmx.safeApprove(contractAddress, type(uint256).max);             return;         } ``` As you can see it resets the spending approval of old `stakedGmx` address to zero and then give unlimited spending approval for new address. So the impact #1 is obvious that the code for same logic in two different functions don't beehive similarly.  Function `configureGmxState()` is used for configuring GMX contract state but if `owner` uses this function one time then it won't be possible to call this function the second time if `stakedGmx` wasn't changed. for example in this scenario: 1. owner calls `configureGmxState()` to set values for GMX contract addresses. 2. then address of one of contract changes in GMX (`stakedGmx` stayed the same) and owner want's to call `configureGmxState()` to reset the values of variables to correct ones. 3. owner call to `configureGmxState()` would fail because `stakedGmx` address didn't changed and in the line ` gmx.safeApprove(address(stakedGmx), type(uint256).max);` contract tries to set non zero approval for `stakedGmx` but it already has non zero spending allowance. (`safeApprove()` would revert if the current spending allowance is not zero and the new allowance is not zero either). so the impact #2 would happen and calls to this function in some scenarios would fail and it won't be functional.  Because function `configureGmxState()` don't reset the old `stakeGmx` address's GMX token spending approval to 0x0 so it would be possible to lose all GMX balance of `PirexGmx` contract if the old `stakeGmx` addresses are compromised. for example in this scenario: 1. GMX protocol get hacked(either by a bug or leaking some private keys) and `stakeGmx` contract control would be in hacker's hand. 2. GMX deploy new contracts and `stakeGmx` address changes in GMX. () 3. owner of `PirexGmx` calls `configureGmxState()` to reset the values of GMX contracts addresses in `PirexGmx`.  4. function `configureGmxState()` logic would change the GMX contract addresses but it won't set GMX token spending approval for old `stakeGmx` address to zero. 5. hacker who control the old `stakeGmx` address would use his access to that address contract to withdraw GMX balance of `PirexGmx`. because `PirexGmx` won't set approval for old `stakeGmx` contract so it would be possible for that old `stakeGmx` address to transfer GMX balance of `PirexGmx` anytime in future. the bug in old `stakeGmx` contract or leakage of private keys of `stakeGmx` address(private key who can become the owner or admin of that contract) can be happen after migrating GMX and Pirex contracts too. This is impact #3 scenario.  in scenario #4 contract would stuck in unrecoverable state. the problem is that if `configureGmxState()` is get used more than once and `stakeGmx` variable's value has been changes more than once then it won't be possible to set `stakeGmx` value to old values either with `configureGmxState()` or `setContract()` and the contract won't be useful. the scenario is this: (`safeApprove()` won't allow to set non-zero approval for address that has already non-zero approval amount. see the OZ implementation) 1. GMX protocol changes its `stakeGmx` contract address from old address to new (for any reason, they got hacked or they are migrating or ....) 2. `owner` of `PirexGmx` calls `configureGmxState()` to update GMX protocol's contract address in `PirexGmx` contract and the logic would update the values of variables. (the GMX spending approval for old and new `stakeGmx` address would be max value). 3. GMX protocol changes `stakeGmx` contract address from new value to old value (for any reason, they decided to roll back to old address) 4. owner tries to call `configureGmxState()` to reupdate GMX protocol's address in `PirexGmx` but the call would revert because the code tries to call `safeApprove()` for address that has already non-zero allowance. 5. owner can't call `setContract()` to update value of `stakeGmx` variable because this function tries to call `safeApprove()` to set non-zero approval value for address that already has non-zero allowance. so in this state `owner` can't recover `PirexGmx` contract and because contract has wrong value for `stakeGmx` it won't be functional and it would stay in broken state.   ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps like `setContract()`, function `configureGmxState()` should set approval for old `PirexGmx` to zero first.
