# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function depositMultipleVault of VaultHelper doesn't check the array size of _tokens and _amounts are the same length. In previous version of solidity there were bugs with giving an enormous large array to a function which accepted memory arrays.  Although depositMultipleVault uses calldata arrays, it is probably better to add a check on the length.  On the other hand the function depositMultiple of Vault.sol does check it.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/VaultHelper.sol#L57 ```JS  function depositMultipleVault(         address _vault,         address[] calldata _tokens,         uint256[] calldata _amounts     )  external {         for (uint8 i = 0; i < _amounts.length; i++) {         ... ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L188 ```JS  function depositMultiple(         address[] calldata _tokens,         uint256[] calldata _amounts     )  external override notHalted returns (uint256 _shares) {         require(_tokens.length == _amounts.length, "!length");          for (uint8 i; i < _amounts.length; i++) {            ...  ```   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add something like the following in depositMultipleVault:    require(_tokens.length == _amounts.length, "!length");
