# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## Caching `totalPoints` during `setPoints` method  Instead of constantly writing to the same slot in a for loop, write it once at the end. This would save `100` gas for each iteration of the for loop. (Since [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929), the cost of writing to a dirty storage slot is 100 gas)  ``` diff modified   contracts/Access/PointList.sol @@ -65,6 +65,7 @@ contract PointList is IPointList, MISOAccessControls {     function setPoints(address[] memory _accounts, uint256[] memory _amounts) external override {          require(hasAdminRole(msg.sender) || hasOperatorRole(msg.sender), "PointList.setPoints: Sender must be operator");          require(_accounts.length != 0, "PointList.setPoints: empty array");          require(_accounts.length == _amounts.length, "PointList.setPoints: incorrect array length"); +        uint totalPointsCache = totalPoints;          for (uint i = 0; i < _accounts.length; i++) {              address account = _accounts[i];              uint256 amount = _amounts[i]; @@ -72,9 +73,10 @@ contract PointList is IPointList, MISOAccessControls {               if (amount != previousPoints) {                  points[account] = amount; -                totalPoints = totalPoints.sub(previousPoints).add(amount); +                totalPointsCache = totalPointsCache.sub(previousPoints).add(amount);                  emit PointsUpdated(account, previousPoints, amount);              }          } +        totalPoints = totalPointsCache;      }  } ```
