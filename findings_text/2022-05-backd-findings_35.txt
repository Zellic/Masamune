This would be possible since if **advanceEpoch()** or **kill()** is executed by the InflationManager address, the epoch will go up without perPeriodTotalFees[newIndexEpoch] is 0. The negative of this is that every time the **InflationManager** executes these two methods (**kill() and advanceEpoch()**) DoS is generated until you run **reportFees()**. Another possible case is that **kill()** or **advanceEpoch()** are executed 2 times in a row and there is no way of a perPeriodTotalFees[epoch-1] updating its value, therefore it would be an irreversible DoS.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Generate a behavior for the case that perPeriodTotalFees[i] == 0.
