# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UniswapV2LPAdapter/SushiswapV2LPAdapter.update` function retrieves the `underlying` from the LP token pair (`_asset`) but then calls `router.update(_asset, _proof)` which is the LP token itself again. This will end up with the router calling this function again recursively.  ## Impact This function fails as there's an infinite recursion and eventually runs out of gas.  ## Recommendation The idea was most likely to update the `underlying` price which is used in `_getPrice` as `uint256 eAvg = cssr.getExchangeRatio(_underlying, weth);`.  Call `router.update(underlying, _proof)` instead. Note that the `_proof` does not necessarily update the `underlying <> WETH` pair, it could be any `underlying <> keyAsset` pair.
