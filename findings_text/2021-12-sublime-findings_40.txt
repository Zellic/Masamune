# Handle  0xngndev   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  Reduce code size and gas expenditure by inlining internal functions that are only used once throughout your contract.  In some of your contracts, like `AaveYield.sol`, you have an `initialize` function that calls the internal functions `updateSavingsAccount` and `updateAaveAddresses`. These two functions are only called in the `initialize` function, so you can save some gas and code size by simply inlining their logic inside `initialize`. **The tradeoff, of course, is that you lose readability, and because `initialize` will only be called once, perhaps it's not worth the tradeoff.**  To test the difference in code size and gas expenditure I wrote a example contract replicating the behaviour to see how much cheaper inlining the logic was.  **The results:**  Inlining the logic:  - Gas spent: 45155 - Code size: 453 bytes  Separating into internal functions:  - Gas spent: 45189 - Code size: 467 bytes  ### Proof of Concept  Contracts I used to test the gas expenditure and code size differences:  - InliningLogic  ```bash //SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity 0.8.10;  contract InliningLogic {   address public someRandomAddress;   address public anotherRandomAddress;    function assignAddresses(     address _someRandomAddress,     address _anotherRandomAddress   ) public {     someRandomAddress = _someRandomAddress;     anotherRandomAddress = _anotherRandomAddress;   } } ```  - InliningLogic.t —> DappTools test file  ```bash //SPDX-License-Identifier: unlicensed pragma solidity 0.8.10;  import "ds-test/test.sol"; import "../InliningLogic.sol";  contract InliningLogicTest is DSTest {   InliningLogic inliningLogicContract;    function setUp() public {     inliningLogicContract = new InliningLogic();   }    function testInliningLogic() public logs_gas {     inliningLogicContract.assignAddresses(address(0x1), address(0x1));   } } ```  - NotInliningLogic  ```bash //SPDX-License-Identifier: unlicensed pragma solidity 0.8.10;  contract NotInliningLogic {   address public someRandomAddress;   address public anotherRandomAddress;    function assignAddresses(     address _someRandomAddress,     address _anotherRandomAddress   ) public {     _assignAddresses(_someRandomAddress, _anotherRandomAddress);   }    function _assignAddresses(     address _someRandomAddress,     address _anotherRandomAddress   ) internal {     someRandomAddress = _someRandomAddress;     anotherRandomAddress = _anotherRandomAddress;   } } ```  - NotInliningLogic.t —> test file  ```bash //SPDX-License-Identifier: unlicensed pragma solidity 0.8.10;  import "ds-test/test.sol"; import "../NotInliningLogic.sol";  contract NotInliningLogicTest is DSTest {   NotInliningLogic notInliningLogicContract;    function setUp() public {     notInliningLogicContract = new NotInliningLogic();   }    function testNotInliningLogic() public logs_gas {     notInliningLogicContract.assignAddresses(address(0x1), address(0x1));   } } ```  ### Tools  DappTools
