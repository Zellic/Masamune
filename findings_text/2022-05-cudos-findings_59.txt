An attacker is therefore able to predetermine the address of any smart contracts deployed using `deployERC20()`.  One of the limitations of  OpenZeppelin's `token.safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount)` is that it will succeed if there is no bytecode at the `token` address.  The impact of both of these features is that an attacker may call `sendToCosmos(_tokenContract, _destination, _amount)` for an ERC20 token before it is deployed using `deployERC20()` since the address can be calculated. The attacker may set any arbitrary amount and the `IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);` will succeed. The `SendToCosmosEvent` will be emitted and the relevant transfer will occur on the other side of the bridge.   ## Proof of Concept  `IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);` succeeds if `_tokenContract` does not have any bytecode. So the attacker may call `sendToCosmos()`.  Following this the attacker calls `deployERC20()` to deploy the token contract. Note the token contract was precalculated and used as the `_tokenContract` parameter in `sendToCosmos()`.  The bridge will then process `SendToCosmosEvent` on the Cosmos chain.  ```solidity  function sendToCosmos(   address _tokenContract,   bytes32 _destination,   uint256 _amount  ) public nonReentrant  {   IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);   state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);   emit SendToCosmosEvent(    _tokenContract,    msg.sender,    _destination,    _amount,    state_lastEventNonce   );  }   function deployERC20(   string memory _cosmosDenom,   string memory _name,   string memory _symbol,   uint8 _decimals  ) public {   // Deploy an ERC20 with entire supply granted to Gravity.sol   CosmosERC20 erc20 = new CosmosERC20(address(this), _name, _symbol, _decimals);    // Fire an event to let the Cosmos module know   state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);   emit ERC20DeployedEvent(    _cosmosDenom,    address(erc20),    _name,    _symbol,    _decimals,    state_lastEventNonce   );  } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  This issue may be resolved by enforcing `sendToCosmos()` check that `_tokenContract` contains bytecode.  ```solidity  function isContract(address _addr) private returns (bool isContract){      uint32 size;      assembly {          size := extcodesize(_addr)      }       return (size > 0);  }   function sendToCosmos(   address _tokenContract,   bytes32 _destination,   uint256 _amount  ) public nonReentrant  {   require(isContract(_tokenContract, "Invalid contract address"));   IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);                 ...         } ```
