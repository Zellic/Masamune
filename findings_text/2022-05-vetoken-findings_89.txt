Assume a particular address takes up 2 slots out of 3, and a user withdraws staked extra rewards, the user will receive double the amount requested in https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/main/contracts/VE3DRewardPool.sol#L257-L258  ## Proof of Concept 1.  Assume `rewardManager` had mistakenly added the same address twice in `addExtraReward()` 2. A user calls `stake()` , linked rewards is staked twice to the same address (unexpected behaviour I guess but not severe issue) 3. Now, user calls `withdraw()` to withdraw linked rewards (this is already 2x in step 2) 4. User will receive double the linked rewards due to the iteration in `https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/main/contracts/VE3DRewardPool.sol#L257-L258`  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Guess a check for an already existing extraRewards can be added before Line 138  ##Similar issue **https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/main/contracts/VE3DLocker.sol#L156 - not so sure of the severity for this. **https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/main/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L126  - reported in a seperate report
