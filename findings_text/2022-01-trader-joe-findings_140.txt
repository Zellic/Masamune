# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact A division by 0 could occur  ## Proof of Concept There are no checks that the denominator is `!= 0` here: ``` File: LaunchEvent.sol 392:         uint256 tokenAllocated = tokenReserve; 393:  394:         // Adjust the amount of tokens sent to the pool if floor price not met 395:         if ( 396:             floorPrice > (wavaxReserve * 10**token.decimals()) / tokenAllocated 397:         ) { ```  tokenReserve (`uint256 tokenAllocated = tokenReserve;`) can be equal to 0 according to this comment: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L106  Therefore this could happen  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check for `tokenAllocated != 0` before this division
