# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  In some places where data is discarded such as ```bondBurn```, part of the data is set to 0 (```auctionBonder```), and other parts are not (```bondTimestamp```). Setting unnecessary data back to 0 will save gas.  ## Impact Almost 2000 gas saved for each variable reset. In some places, like ```createBasket``` (which only needs to save the proposal's "basket" field after creating the basket), this can save almost 15000 gas.  ## Proof of Concept Places where data is not reset: Factory's createBasket (set all _proposals[idNumber]'s fields to be 0 except basket) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L112 Basket's changePublisher: (set pendingPublisher.block = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L141 Basket's changeLicenseFee: (set pendingLicenseFee.block = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L159 Basket's setNewWeights and deleteNewIndex: (set pendingWeights.tokens and pendingWeights.weights to empty arrays) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L200 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L212 Auction's killAuction: (set auctionStart = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L44 Auction's settleAuction: (set bondTimestamp, auctionBonder = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L107 Auction's bondBurn: (set bondTimestamp = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L120 Auction's withdrawBounty: (set bounty.token, bounty.token = 0) https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L148  ## Tools Used Manual analysis, hardhat.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Detailed above.
