# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  For public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically which costs gas. If a function is only called externally, making its visibility as external will save gas because external function’s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly. If a function is called only from with that contract or derived contracts, making it internal/private can further reduce gas costs because the expensive calls are converted into cheaper jumps.   ## Proof of Concept  The only callers of eoaOnly() are external contracts DepositHandler and WithdrawHandler. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L268 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/DepositHandler.sol#L112 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/WithdrawHandler.sol#L211 The only caller of calcSystemTargetDelta() is Insurance. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/insurance/Allocation.sol#L62-L63 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/insurance/Insurance.sol#L213 The only caller of calcVaultTargetDelta() is Insurance. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/insurance/Allocation.sol#L92-L93 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/insurance/Insurance.sol#L432 validGTokenDecrease() can be made private just like validGTokenIncrease because it is only called from within Controller. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L448 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L248   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change function visibility from public to external/private where possible.
