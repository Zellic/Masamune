# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost  ## Proof of Concept In `L2LPTDataCache.sol:decreaseL2SupplyFromL1()`, the code is as follows:  ``` File: L2LPTDataCache.sol 57:     function decreaseL2SupplyFromL1(uint256 _amount) external onlyL2LPTGateway { 58:         // If there is a mass withdrawal from L2, _amount could exceed l2SupplyFromL1. 59:         // In this case, we just set l2SupplyFromL1 = 0 because there will be no more supply on L2 60:         // that is from L1 and the excess (_amount - l2SupplyFromL1) is inflationary LPT that was 61:         // never from L1 in the first place. 62:         if (_amount > l2SupplyFromL1) {  63:             l2SupplyFromL1 = 0; 64:         } else { 65:             l2SupplyFromL1 -= _amount; 66:         } 67:  68:         // No event because the L2LPTGateway events are sufficient 69:     } ```  However, this can be optimized : - Strict inequalities (`>`) are more expensive than non-strict ones (`>=`). This is due to some supplementary checks (ISZERO) - In this case here, if `_amount == l2SupplyFromL1`, `0` should be returned - Avoiding the else clause would avoid some opcodes (1 SUB,  1 SLOAD, 1 MLOAD)  The code would become:  ```         if (_amount >= l2SupplyFromL1) {             l2SupplyFromL1 = 0;         } else {             l2SupplyFromL1 -= _amount;         } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the non-strict greater-than operator in this particular case
