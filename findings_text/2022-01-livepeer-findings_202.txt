# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Per the document: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer#l2---l1-lpt-withdrawal  > The following occurs when LPT is withdrawn from L2 to L1:  > The user initiates a withdrawal for X LPT. This can be done in two ways: a. Call outboundTransfer() on L2GatewayRouter which will call outboundTransfer() on L2LPTGateway b. Call outboundTransfer() directly on L2LPTGateway  The method (a) described above won't work in the current implementation due to the missing interface on `L2LPTGateway`.  When initiate a withdraw from the Arbitrum Gateway Router, `L2GatewayRouter` will call `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)` on `ITokenGateway(gateway)`:  ```solidity function outboundTransfer(     address _token,     address _to,     uint256 _amount,     uint256 _maxGas,     uint256 _gasPriceBid,     bytes calldata _data ) external payable returns (bytes memory); ```  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/b8366005a697000dda1f57a78a7bdb2313db8fe2/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2GatewayRouter.sol#L57-L64  ```solidity function outboundTransfer(     address _l1Token,     address _to,     uint256 _amount,     bytes calldata _data ) public payable returns (bytes memory) {     return outboundTransfer(_l1Token, _to, _amount, 0, 0, _data); } ```  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/b8366005a697000dda1f57a78a7bdb2313db8fe2/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/gateway/GatewayRouter.sol#L78-L102  ```solidity function outboundTransfer(     address _token,     address _to,     uint256 _amount,     uint256 _maxGas,     uint256 _gasPriceBid,     bytes calldata _data ) public payable virtual override returns (bytes memory) {     address gateway = getGateway(_token);     bytes memory gatewayData = GatewayMessageHandler.encodeFromRouterToGateway(         msg.sender,         _data     );      emit TransferRouted(_token, msg.sender, _to, gateway);     return         ITokenGateway(gateway).outboundTransfer{ value: msg.value }(             _token,             _to,             _amount,             _maxGas,             _gasPriceBid,             gatewayData         ); } ```  However, `L2LPTGateway` dose not implement `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)` but only `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)`:  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/gateway/L2LPTGateway.sol#L65-L89  ```solidity function outboundTransfer(     address _l1Token,     address _to,     uint256 _amount,     bytes calldata _data ) public override whenNotPaused returns (bytes memory res) {     // ... } ```  Therefore, the desired feature to withdraw LPT from L2 to L1 via Arbitrum Router will not be working properly.  ## Recommendation  Consider implementing the method used by  Arbitrum Router.
