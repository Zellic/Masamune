This is `_payoutReward()` code: ```     function _payoutRewards() internal {         if (block.timestamp < payoutLastPaid + rewardPeriod) return;         uint48 numPeriods = (uint48(block.timestamp) - payoutLastPaid) / rewardPeriod;          uint192 initRate = exchangeRate();         uint256 payout;          // Do an actual payout if and only if stakers exist!         if (totalStakes > 0) {             // Paying out the ratio r, N times, equals paying out the ratio (1 - (1-r)^N) 1 time.             // Apply payout to RSR backing             // payoutRatio: D18 = FIX_ONE: D18 - FixLib.powu(): D18             // Both uses of uint192(-) are fine, as it's equivalent to FixLib.sub().             uint192 payoutRatio = FIX_ONE - FixLib.powu(FIX_ONE - rewardRatio, numPeriods);              // payout: {qRSR} = D18{1} * {qRSR} / D18             payout = (payoutRatio * rsrRewardsAtLastPayout) / FIX_ONE;             stakeRSR += payout;         }          payoutLastPaid += numPeriods * rewardPeriod;         rsrRewardsAtLastPayout = rsrRewards();          // stakeRate else case: D18{qStRSR/qRSR} = {qStRSR} * D18 / {qRSR}         // downcast is safe: it's at most 1e38 * 1e18 = 1e56         // untestable:         //      the second half of the OR comparison is untestable because of the invariant:         //      if totalStakes == 0, then stakeRSR == 0         stakeRate = (stakeRSR == 0 || totalStakes == 0)             ? FIX_ONE             : uint192((totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR);          emit RewardsPaid(payout);         emit ExchangeRateSet(initRate, exchangeRate());     } ``` As you can see it sets the value of the `stakeRate`  to `(totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR`.  So to exploit this attacker needs to perform this steps: 1. send `200 * 1e18` RSR tokens (18 is the precision) to the StRSR address before its deployment by watching mempool and front running. the deployment address is calculable before deployment. 2. function `init()` would get executed and would set `200 * 1e18` as `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout`. 3. then attacker would call `stake()` and stake 1 RSR token (1 wei) in the contract and the value of `stakeRSR` and `totalStakes` would be 1. 4. then attacker wait for `rewardPeriod` seconds and then call `payoutReward()` and code would pay rewards based on `rewardRatio` and `rsrRewardsAtLastPayout` and as `rewardRatio` is higher than 1% (default and normal mode) code would increase `stakeRate` more than `2 * 1e18` amount. and then code would set `stakeRate` as `totalStakes * FIX_ONE_256 + (stakeRSR - 1)) / stakeRSR = 1`. 5. then calls to `stake()` would cause users to lose up to `1e18` RSR tokens as code calculates stake amount as `newTotalStakes = (stakeRate * newStakeRSR) / FIX_ONE` and rounding error happens up to `FIX_ONE`. because the calculated stake amount is worth less than deposited rsr amount up to `1e18`. 6. attacker can still users funds by unstaking 1 token and receiving `1e18` RSR tokens. because of the rounding error in `unstake()`  so attacker can manipulate the `stakeRate` in contract deployment time with sandwich attack which can cause other users to lose funds because of the big rounding error.  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps prevent early manipulation of the PPS
