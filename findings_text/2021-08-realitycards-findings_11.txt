# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The contract RCNftHubL2 contains a function addMarket and an array isMarket. This was useful in the previous version of the contract, but now it is no longer used. Note: isMarket() could be used to retrieve the markets from RCNftHubL2, but there are also other ways to do that.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/nfthubs/RCNftHubL2.sol#L31 /// @dev so only markets can move NFTs     mapping(address => bool) public isMarket;   /// @dev so only markets can change ownership     function addMarket(address _newMarket) external override {         require(msgSender() == address(factory), "Not factory");         isMarket[_newMarket] = true;     }      // MARKET ONLY     function transferNft( address _currentOwner,  address _newOwner,   uint256 _tokenId ) external override {         require(marketTracker[_tokenId] == msgSender(), "Not market");         _transfer(_currentOwner, _newOwner, _tokenId);     }  //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L636 function createMarket( ...  nfthub.addMarket(_newAddress);  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Double check if isMarket and addMarket have any use left. If not remove them from RCNftHubL2 Also remove the call to nfthub.addMarket(_newAddress) from RCFactory.sol
