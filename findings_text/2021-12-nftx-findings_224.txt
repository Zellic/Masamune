# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Native fund transfers into the zap contract are only expected from the WETH contract. Hence, it would be good to restrict incoming fund transfers to prevent accidental native fund transfers from other sources.  This is also true even though `sushiRouter.swapExactTokensForETH()` is called, as the recipient of the swap is expected to not be the marketplace zap contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Modify the `receive()` function to only accept transfers from the wrapped token contract.  ```jsx receive() external payable {   require(msg.sender == address(WETH), "Only WETH"); } ```
