# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The variable v is declared after the first use of its contents.  Moving the declaration before the first use will save gas.  ## Proof of Concept  "v" is declared here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L180  But "v"s contents (validators[validatorId]) is used here first: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L178  Move line 180 above line 178 and change line 178 to use "v".  I've run out of contest time to continue testing but I'd recommend looking through the following functions for how "validators[validatorId]" may be used more efficiently. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L272 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L346   ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps See Proof of Concept
