This looks like an oversight since the same access control level should be enforced.  For example, the `executeLpPoolWeight` function allows anyone to call it:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L241-L249  ``` function executeLpPoolWeight(address lpToken) external override returns (uint256) {    (...) } ```   But the batched version enforces the caller to have `GOVERNANCE` or `INFLATION_MANAGER` roles:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L284-L301  ``` function batchExecuteLpPoolWeights(address[] calldata lpTokens)         external         override         onlyRoles2(Roles.GOVERNANCE, Roles.INFLATION_MANAGER)         returns (bool)     { ```  The same happens in `executeAmmTokenWeight` versus `batchExecuteAmmTokenWeights` , as well as `executeKeeperPoolWeight` versus `batchExecuteKeeperPoolWeights`.  If only trusted roles should be able to execute pending actions then the `onlyRoles` modifier should be added to the non-batched functions.  Scenarios where you would not want to allow anyone to execute could include potential votes/changes that may trigger a bug or undesired behavior noticed after it had already been approved.  ## Tools Used  vim  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Enforce the proper access control mechanism in non-batched execute functions.
