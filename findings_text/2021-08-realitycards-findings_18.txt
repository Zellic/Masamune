# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The variable, `marketWhitelist`, is never initialized in the contract `RCTreasury.sol`. As a result, the function `marketWhitelistCheck()`  does not perform a proper check on whitelisted users for a restricted market. Additionally, the function will always return `true`, even if a market wishes to restrict its users to a specific role.   ## Proof of Concept  The initial state variable is defined in the link below. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L75  The state variable `marketWhitelist` is accessed in the function `RCTreasury.marketWhitelistCheck()` as per below. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L269-L281  The function `RCTreasury.marketWhitelistCheck()` is called in `RCMarket.newRental()` as seen below. The comment indicates that there should be some ability to restrict certain markets to specific whitelists, however, there are no methods in `RCTreasury` that allow a market creator to enable this functionality. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L758-L761  ## Tools Used  `npx hardhat coverage` `slither` Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure this behaviour is intended. If this is not the case, consider adding a function that enables a market creator to restrict their market to a specific role by whitelisting users.
