# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `redeemToken` function in `IdleYieldSource` uses `redeemedShare` instead of `redeemAmount` as the input parameter when calling `redeemIdleToken` of the Idle yield source. As a result, users could get fewer underlying tokens than they should.  ## Proof of Concept  When burning users' shares, it is correct to use `redeemedShare` (line 130). However, when redeeming underlying tokens from Idle Finance, `redeemAmount` should be used instead of `redeemedShare` (line 131). Usually, the `tokenPriceWithFee()` is greater than `ONE_IDLE_TOKEN`, and thus `redeemedShare` is less than `redeemAmount`, causing users to get fewer underlying tokens than expected.
