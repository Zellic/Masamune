# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L208-L212   # Vulnerability details  ## Proof of Concept Observe that if nobody has staked after the period has ended, it's still possible for a single user to stake even though the period has ended. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L208-L212 ```         if (firstStakeTime == 0) {             firstStakeTime = block.timestamp;         } else {             require(block.timestamp < endTime, "MuteAmplifier::stake: staking is over");         } ```  The staker can't get any of the rewards because the update modifier won't drip the rewards (since _mostRecentValueCalcTime = firstStakeTime >= endTime). https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L89-L95 ```         if (_mostRecentValueCalcTime == 0) {             _mostRecentValueCalcTime = firstStakeTime;         }          uint256 totalCurrentStake = totalStake();          if (totalCurrentStake > 0 && _mostRecentValueCalcTime < endTime) {             ...         } ```  At the same time, the protocol can't withdraw the rewards with rescueToken either since there is a staker, and no reward has been claimed yet (so the following check fails). https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L187 ```         else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {             if (totalStakers > 0) {                 require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards)),                     "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"                 );             }         } ```  ## Impact Suppose the staking period ends and nobody has staked. The admin would like to withdraw the rewards. A malicious user can front-run the rescueTokens call with a call to stake to lock all the rewards inside the contract indefinitely.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/main/contracts/amplifier/MuteAmplifier.sol#L208-L212 The require shouldn't be inside the else block.
