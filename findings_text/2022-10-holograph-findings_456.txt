Some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) on ERC20 methods. But since the require-statement expects a `bool`, for such a token a `void` return will also cause a revert, despite an otherwise successful transfer. That is, the token payout will always revert for such tokens.  ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use [OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol), which handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
