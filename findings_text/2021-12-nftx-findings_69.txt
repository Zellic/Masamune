# Handle  cccz   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the NFTXSimpleFeeDistributor.sol contract, the distribute function calls the _sendForReceiver function to distribute the fee  ```   function distribute(uint256 vaultId) external override virtual nonReentrant {     require(nftxVaultFactory != address(0));     address _vault = INFTXVaultFactory(nftxVaultFactory).vault(vaultId);      uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).balanceOf(address(this));      if (distributionPaused || allocTotal == 0) {       IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).safeTransfer(treasury, tokenBalance);       return;     }      uint256 length = feeReceivers.length;     uint256 leftover;     for (uint256 i = 0; i <length; i++) {       FeeReceiver memory _feeReceiver = feeReceivers[i];       uint256 amountToSend = leftover + ((tokenBalance * _feeReceiver.allocPoint) / allocTotal);       uint256 currentTokenBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).balanceOf(address(this));       amountToSend = amountToSend> currentTokenBalance? currentTokenBalance: amountToSend;       bool complete = _sendForReceiver(_feeReceiver, vaultId, _vault, amountToSend);       if (!complete) {         leftover = amountToSend;       } else {         leftover = 0;       }     } ```  In the _sendForReceiver function, when the _receiver is a contract, the receiver's receiveRewards function will be called. If the receiver is malicious, it can execute revert() in the receiveRewards function, resulting in DOS.  ```   function _sendForReceiver(FeeReceiver memory _receiver, uint256 _vaultId, address _vault, uint256 amountToSend) internal virtual returns (bool) {     if (_receiver.isContract) {       IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).approve(_receiver.receiver, amountToSend);       // If the receive is not properly processed, send it to the treasury instead.               bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSelector(INFTXLPStaking.receiveRewards.selector, _vaultId, amountToSend);       (bool success,) = address(_receiver.receiver).call(payload);        // If the allowance has not been spent, it means we can pass it forward to next.       return success && IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).allowance(address(this), _receiver.receiver) == 0;     } else {       IERC20Upgradeable(_vault).safeTransfer(_receiver.receiver, amountToSend);     }   } ```  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXSimpleFeeDistributor.sol#L157-L166  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The contract can store the fee sent to the receiver in a state variable, and then the receiver can take it out by calling a function.
