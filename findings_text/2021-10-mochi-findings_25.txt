# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The value of the global variable debts in the contract MochiVault.sol is calculated in an inconsistent way.  In the function borrow() the variable debts is increased with a value excluding the fee. However in repay() and liquidate() it is decreased with the same value as details[_id].debt is decreased,, which is including the fee.  This would mean that debts will end up in a negative value when all debts are repay-ed. Luckily the function repay() prevents this from happening.  In the mean time the value of debts isn't accurate. This value is used directly or indirectly in:  - utilizationRatio(), stabilityFee() calculateFeeIndex() of MochiProfileV0.sol  - liveDebtIndex(), accrueDebt(), currentDebt() of MochiVault.sol  This means the entire debt and claimable calculations are slightly off.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol  function borrow(..)     details[_id].debt = totalDebt; // includes the fee     debts += _amount;     // excludes the fee   function repay(..)     debts -= _amount;       details[_id].debt -= _amount;  function liquidate(..)    debts -= _usdm;    details[_id].debt -= _usdm;  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L263-L268  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/profile/MochiProfileV0.sol#L272-L283  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/profile/MochiProfileV0.sol#L242-L256  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/profile/MochiProfileV0.sol#L258-L269  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L66-L73  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L79-L88  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In function borrow(): replace     debts += _amount; with     debts += totalDebt
