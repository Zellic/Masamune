# Handle  robee   # Vulnerability details  Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments.  Further more, using unchecked {++x} is even more gas efficient, and the gas saving accumulates every iteration and can make a real change There is no risk of overflow caused by increamenting the iteration index in for loops (the `++i` in `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i)`). But increments perform overflow checks that are not necessary in this case. These functions use not using prefix increments (`++x`) or not using the unchecked keyword:           just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistribution.sol, i, 80         just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistribution.sol, i, 212         just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistribution.sol, i, 325         just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistributionHelper.sol, i, 15         just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistributionHelper.sol, i, 29         just change to unchecked: XDEFIDistributionHelper.sol, i, 42
