Thus, comparing it with `2` actually means a 2 seconds buffer instead of a 2 weeks buffer.  The intention is to wait for 2 weeks before extending the lock time again, but the current implementation allows the extension of the lock once a new week begins.  ### Recommendation  Consider changing the name of `unlockTime` to `unlockTimeInWeeks`, and:  1. Change L94-102 to:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/CrvDepositor.sol#L94-L102  ```solidity uint256 unlockAt = block.timestamp + MAXTIME; uint256 unlockInWeeks = unlockAt / WEEK;  //release old lock if exists IStaker(staker).release(); //create new lock uint256 crvBalanceStaker = IERC20(crvBpt).balanceOf(staker); IStaker(staker).createLock(crvBalanceStaker, unlockAt); unlockTimeInWeeks = unlockInWeeks; ```  2. Change L127-L134 to:  ```solidity uint256 unlockAt = block.timestamp + MAXTIME; uint256 unlockInWeeks = unlockAt / WEEK;  //increase time too if over 2 week buffer if(unlockInWeeks.sub(unlockTime) > 2){     IStaker(staker).increaseTime(unlockAt);     unlockTimeInWeeks = unlockInWeeks; } ```
