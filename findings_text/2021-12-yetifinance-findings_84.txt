# Handle  SolidityScan   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Events are important and should be emitted for tracking this off-chain for all important functions.   ## Proof of Concept 1. The function "updateTeamAddress" is used to update the team's address but we can notice no event is emitted.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/TeamAllocation.sol#L81-L83  2. The same in function "updateTeamWallet" at  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/YetiFinanceTreasury.sol#L28-L30  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an event to these important functions where address updation is happening. This can also be marked as indexed event for better off-chain tracking
