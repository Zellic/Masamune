# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `claim()` function asserts that the claimable amount is strictly less than `benTotal` for a given user. However, this does not take into account previously claimed tokens, hence the `require` does not accurately depict its intended behaviour.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/Vesting.sol#L197  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider updating this `require` statement to account for already claimed tokens. This could look like the following: `require(amount.add(benClaimed[msg.sender]) <= benTotal[msg.sender], "Cannot withdraw more than total vested amount");`
