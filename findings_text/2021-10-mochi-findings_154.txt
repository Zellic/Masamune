# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact contract USDM does not need to import IERC3156FlashLender again as it was already imported in IUSDM.   import "../interfaces/IERC3156FlashLender.sol";  contract DutchAuctionLiquidator makes no use of these imports:   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol";   import "@uniswap/v2-periphery/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV2Router02.sol";   import "@mochifi/library/contracts/BeaconProxyDeployer.sol";  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider reviewing all the unused imports and removing them to reduce the size of the contract and thus save some deployment gas.
