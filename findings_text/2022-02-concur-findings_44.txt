# Handle  robee   # Vulnerability details  Title: Unnecessary equals boolean Severity: GAS   Boolean variables can be checked within conditionals directly without the use of equality operators to true/false.          VoteProxy.sol, 21: if (auctioneer.isWinningSignature(_hash, _signature) == true) {    Title: State variables that could be set immutable Severity: GAS  In the following files there are state variables that could be set immutable to save gas.           startBlock in MasterChef.sol         client in Shelter.sol         masterChef in ConvexStakingWrapper.sol         endBlock in MasterChef.sol         rewardNotifier in ConcurRewardPool.sol         concur in MasterChef.sol    Title: Caching array length can save gas Severity: GAS   Caching the array length is more gas efficient. This is because access to a local variable in solidity is more efficient than query storage / calldata / memory. We recommend to change from:          for (uint256 i=0; i<array.length; i++) { ... }  to:       uint len = array.length       for (uint256 i=0; i<len; i++) { ... }           ConcurRewardPool.sol, _tokens, 35    Title: Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments Severity: GAS  Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments.  Further more, using unchecked {++x} is even more gas efficient, and the gas saving accumulates every iteration and can make a real change There is no risk of overflow caused by increamenting the iteration index in for loops (the `++i` in `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i)`). But increments perform overflow checks that are not necessary in this case. These functions use not using prefix increments (`++x`) or not using the unchecked keyword:           just change to unchecked: MasterChef.sol, _pid, 129         change to prefix increment and unchecked: ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, i, 219         change to prefix increment and unchecked: ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, i, 121         change to prefix increment and unchecked: ConcurRewardPool.sol, i, 35    Title: Unnecessary index init Severity: GAS   In for loops you initialize the index to start from 0, but it already initialized to 0 in default and this assignment cost gas.  It is more clear and gas efficient to declare without assigning 0 and will have the same meaning:          ConcurRewardPool.sol, 35         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, 219         MasterChef.sol, 129         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, 121    Title: Internal functions to private Severity: GAS  The following functions could be set private to save gas and improve code quality:          EasySign.sol, tryRecover         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _calcRewardIntegral         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _checkpoint         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getDepositedBalance         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getTotalSupply         EasySign.sol, recover    Title: Public functions to external Severity: GAS  The following functions could be set external to save gas and improve code quality.  External call cost is less expensive than of public functions.           MasterChef.sol, massUpdatePools         MasterChef.sol, add         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, addRewards    Title: Unnecessary default assignment Severity: GAS   Unnecessary default assignments, you can just declare and it will save gas and have the same meaning.               StakingRewards.sol (L#22) : uint256 public rewardRate = 0;         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol (L#36) : uint256 public constant CRV_INDEX = 0;         MasterChef.sol (L#51) : uint public totalAllocPoint = 0;         StakingRewards.sol (L#21) : uint256 public periodFinish = 0;    Title: Rearrange state variables Severity: GAS  You can change the order of the storage variables to decrease memory uses.  In USDMPegRecovery.sol,rearranging the storage fields can optimize to: 7 slots from: 8 slots. The new order of types (you choose the actual variables):         1. IERC20         2. IERC20         3. ICurveMetaPool         4. uint256         5. uint256         6. Liquidity         7. address         8. bool     Title: Short the following require messages Severity: GAS  The following require messages are of length more than 32 and we think are short enough to short them into exactly 32 characters such that it will be placed in one slot of memory and the require  function will cost less gas.  The list:           Solidity file: StakingRewards.sol, In line 170, Require message length to shorten: 33, The message: Cannot withdraw the staking token         Solidity file: MasterChef.sol, In line 210, Require message length to shorten: 35, The message: safeConcurTransfer: transfer failed    Title: Unused imports Severity: GAS   In the following files there are contract imports that aren't used Import of unnecessary files costs deployment gas (and is a bad coding practice that is important to ignore)          ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, line 9, import "./external/ConvexInterfaces.sol";         USDMPegRecovery.sol, line 7, import { ICurveMetaPool } from "./external/CurveInterfaces.sol";    Title: Use != 0 instead of > 0 Severity: GAS   Using != 0 is slightly cheaper than > 0. (see https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/75 for similar issue)           MasterChef.sol, 169: change '_amount > 0' to '_amount != 0'         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, 262: change '_amount > 0' to '_amount != 0'         MasterChef.sol, 194: change '_amount > 0' to '_amount != 0'         USDMPegRecovery.sol, 74: change 'balance > 0' to 'balance != 0'         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, 236: change '_amount > 0' to '_amount != 0'         StakingRewards.sol, 94: change 'amount > 0' to 'amount != 0'         StakingRewards.sol, 108: change 'amount > 0' to 'amount != 0'         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, 184: change '_supply > 0' to '_supply != 0'    Title: Use unchecked to save gas for certain additive calculations that cannot overflow Severity: GAS   You can use unchecked in the following calculations since there is no risk to overflow:          StakingRewards.sol (L#161) - periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;         Shelter.sol (L#53) - require(activated[_token] != 0 && activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp, "shelter not activated");         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol (L#279) - return uint64((block.timestamp - VOTECYCLE_START) / 2 weeks) + 1;         Shelter.sol (L#45) - require(activated[_token] != 0 && activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD > block.timestamp, "too late");    Title: Use calldata instead of memory Severity: GAS   Use calldata instead of memory for function parameters In some cases, having function arguments in calldata instead of memory is more optimal.               EasySign.isWinningSignature (_signature)    Title: Consider inline the following functions to save gas Severity: GAS       You can inline the following functions instead of writing a specific function to save gas.     (see https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested-findings/issues/167 for a similar issue.)               ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getDepositedBalance, { return deposits[_pid][_account].amount; }         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getTotalSupply, { return IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).balanceOf(address(this)); }    Title: Inline one time use functions Severity: GAS   The following functions are used exactly once. Therefore you can inline them and save gas and improve code clearness.               ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _calcRewardIntegral         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getDepositedBalance         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, _getTotalSupply    Title: Check if amount is not zero to save gas Severity: GAS  The following functions could skip other steps if the amount is 0.
