# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The ability of a borrower to repay a loan is disabled if the interest rate is  set too high by the `InterestRateModel`.  However, there is neither a check when setting the interest rate nor an  indication in the `IInterestRateModel`'s specs of this behavior.  But this issue could also be used in an adversarial fashion by the  `FixedInterestRateModel`-owner if he/she would disable the repay functionality  for some time and enables it at a later point again with the demand of a  higher interest to be paid by the borrower.  ## Proof of Concept If an account wants to repay a loan, the function  `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh()` is used. This function calls  `UToken::accrueInterest()` ([line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/main/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L465) 465)  which fetches the current borrow rate of the interest rate model  ([line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/main/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L546) 546  and [line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/main/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L330) 330).  The function `UToken::borrowRatePerBlock()` requires an not "absurdly high"  rate, or fails otherwise ([line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/main/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L331) 331).  However, there is no check or indicator in `FixedInterestRateModel.sol` to  prevent the owner to set such a high rate that effectively disables repay of borrowed funds ([line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/main/contracts/market/FixedInterestRateModel.sol#L36) 36).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Disallow setting the interest rate too high with a check in  `FixedInterestRateModel::setInterestRate()`.
