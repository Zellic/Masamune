# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function setAdvanceIncentive of DAO.sol doesn't check for a maximum value of incentive. If incentivewould be very large, then advanceIncentive would be very large and the function advance() would mint a large amount of malt.  The function setAdvanceIncentive() can only be called by an admin, but a mistake could be made. Also if an admin would want to do a rug pull, this would be an ideal place to do it.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L98-L104  ```JS   function setAdvanceIncentive(uint256 incentive)  externalonlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin role") {    ...     advanceIncentive = incentive; ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L55-L63  ```JS function advance() external { ...     malt.mint(msg.sender, advanceIncentive * 1e18);  ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check for a reasonable maximum value in advance()
