In doing so, the seller will receive funds from the buyer, but the buyer will not receive any NFT from the seller. This could happen in the following cases: 1. a token that claims to be ERC-721/1155 compliant, but fails to implement the `supportsInterface()` function properly. 2. an NFT that follows a standard other than ERC-721/1155 and does not implement their EIP-165 interfaces. 3. a malicious contract that is deployed to take advantage of this behavior.   ## Proof of Concept https://gist.github.com/kylriley/3bf0e03d79b3d62dd5a9224ca00c4cb9  ## Tools Used N/A  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps If neither the ERC-721 nor the ERC-1155 interface is supported the function should revert. An alternative approach would be to attempt a `transferFrom` and check the balance before and after to ensure that it succeeded.
