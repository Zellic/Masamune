# Handle  Meta0xNull   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The current ownership transfer process involves the current TIMELOCK_ROLE calling reassignGlobalAdmin().  If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible the owner may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled account, breaking all functions with the TIMELOCK_ROLE modifier.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Permissions.sol#L63-L77  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider implementing a two step process where the TIMELOCK_ROLE nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an accept_TIMELOCK_ROLE() function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.
