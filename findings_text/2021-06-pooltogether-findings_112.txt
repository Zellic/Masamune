# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the contracts `BadgerYieldSource` and `SushiYieldSource`, the return values of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` are not checked to be `true`, which could be `false` if the transferred tokens are not ERC20-compliant (e.g., `BADGER`). In that case, the transfer fails without being noticed by the calling contract.  ## Proof of Concept  If warden's understanding of the `BadgerYieldSource` is correct, the `badger` variable should be the `BADGER` token at address `0x3472a5a71965499acd81997a54bba8d852c6e53d`. However, this implementation of `BADGER` is not ERC20-compliant, which returns `false` when the sender does not have enough token to transfer (both for `transfer` and `transferFrom`). See the [source code on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3472a5a71965499acd81997a54bba8d852c6e53d#code) (at line 226) for more details.
