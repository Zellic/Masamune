I can't find other contracts that use this function but WETH.sol is a base contract and it should be fixed properly.   ## Proof of Concept In this function, the "return" keyword is missing and it will always output 0 in this case.   ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps L104 should be changed like below. ``` return _allowance[owner][spender]; ```
