Alice calls the sc to `claim` rewards ```solidity  IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId, amount_, '0x00'); ```  2. `_afterTokenTransfer`  which causes the sc  to  call a function in its fallback function that transfers  the approved token to  the sc ```solidity    try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) { ``` 3. We then reenter with  recipient,not yet claimed token  and we claim it  result:  the invariant that `redeemedTokens` = tokens that are redeemed is false because it doesn't account for the first token that we reentered.  The issue is worse  with `erc777` tokens because of  the fact  that accounting will be in  the `withdrawRemainingTokens` function ```solidity           uint256 unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;         uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);  ``` after the reentrancy  ex: `redeemedTokens=9` but should be 10 `receiptRedeemers()=12`  `rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId=1e5` `unclaimedTokens=300000 ` assuming they are some tokens left  `balance(address(this)=201000` and `protocolFee=500` `nonClaimableTokens=201000 - 500 - 300000` it would revert ( negative numbers  with uint) and   funds would be stuck in the contract forever The real estimate for `nonClaimableTokens=201000-500-200000=500` and the owner can get funds out  but 500 wei will be lost in the contract  and  it can get worse with large amounts of quests and the attacker  reentering multiple times to cause a bigger gap between the real `redeemedTokens`   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps add  nonReentrancy modifier
