# [L-01] Missing nonReentrant for function not using checks-effects-interactions  The `batchToTresury` function has access control, but it's updating the state after external calls. Consider adding a `nonReetrancy` modifier.  ``` File: src/policies/BondCallback.sol function batchToTreasury(ERC20[] memory tokens_) external onlyRole("callback_admin") {     ERC20 token;     uint256 balance;     uint256 len = tokens_.length;     for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {         token = tokens_[i];         balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));         token.safeTransfer(address(TRSRY), balance);         priorBalances[token] = token.balanceOf(address(this));          unchecked {             ++i;         }     } } ```  # [L-02] Missing zero address checks for setters  Consider adding checks against zero address when a function is receiving an input address.  ``` File: main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol 64: function setApprovalFor( 122: function setDebt( ```  # [NC-01] Non library files should use fixed compiler verion  Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an outdated compiler version. Note that pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or a package.
