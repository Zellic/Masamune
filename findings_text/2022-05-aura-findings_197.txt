# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/ConvexMasterChef.sol#L178-L183   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact massUpdatePools() is a public function and it calls the updatePool() function for the length of poolInfo. Hence, it is an unbounded loop, depending on the length of poolInfo. If poolInfo.length is big enough, block gas limit may be hit.  ## Proof of Concept https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/#dos-with-block-gas-limit  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I suggest to limit the max number of loop iterations to prevent hitting block gas limit.
