Even if this does not affect any other part of the process, the mapping `cancelledOrders` still gets updated and a `CancelledOrder` event is emitted, this could cause issues on a front-end or monitoring tools working with the protocol.  ## Proof of Concept  ```solidity function cancel(Order memory order) public {         require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");          bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);          // mark the order as cancelled         cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;          emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check if the order was already filled before. This could be done by checking if an `nft` with the order id was created before.  ```diff function cancel(Order memory order) public {         require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");          bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);          +       require(ownerOf(uint256(orderHash)) == address(0), "This order was already filled");          // mark the order as cancelled         cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;          emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);     } ```
