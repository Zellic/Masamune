As it is very likely that the strategy will not start with any BADGER tokens, the second transfer will revert (as we are using safeTransfer). This means that `claimBribesFromHiddenHand()` will always revert preventing any other bribes from being received. ## Proof of Concept 1. `claimBribesFromHiddenHand()` is called by strategist 2. Multiple bribes are sent to the strategy including BADGER. For example lets say 50 USDT And 50 BADGER 3. Strategy receives BADGER and calls `_handleRewardTransfer()` which calls `_sendBadgerToTree()`. 50 BADGER is sent to the Badger Tree so balance has dropped to 0. 4. 50 Badger is then again sent to Vault however balance is 0 so the command fails and reverts 5. No more tokens can be claimed anymore  ## Tools Used VS Code ## Recommended Mitigation Steps `_processExtraToken()` eventually sends the badger to the badger tree through the `Vault` contract. Change ```     function _sendBadgerToTree(uint256 amount) internal {         IERC20Upgradeable(BADGER).safeTransfer(BADGER_TREE, amount);         _processExtraToken(address(BADGER), amount);     } ``` to ```     function _sendBadgerToTree(uint256 amount) internal {         _processExtraToken(address(BADGER), amount);     } ```
