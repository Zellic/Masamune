They can open their vault to other users who pay attention to the markets and would call `rebalance` to recieve the insentivized fees. The `vaultOwner` who doesn't want to pay the baiting high fees instead front-runs the `autoRebalance()` with `setAutomation()` to lower incentives.  ## Proof of Concept 1. A Mallory a `vaultOwner` isn't confident in staying up-to-date with market conditions. She has her vault setup to be automated and has high fee incentives.  2. Alice a user who is confident in staying up-to-date with market conditions see's a profitable opportunity and calls `rebalance()`. 3. Mallory is confident in her programing and watching mempools for when `rebalance()` is called. See's that Alice just called `rebalance()` and calls `setAutomation()` to lower the incentives.  4. Alice's call to `rebalance()` then goes through getting lower incentives and Mallory then calls `setAutomation()` to set the incentives back to normal.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a time-lock to `setAutomation` so that the `vaultOwner` can't front-run users.
