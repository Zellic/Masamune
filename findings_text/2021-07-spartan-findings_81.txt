# Handle  natus   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   This function calls revenueArray from storage when setting 'n' and then twice every loop (revenueArray[i] && revenueArray[i - 1]) and then again after the loop once.     If this was instead called once at the start and stored in memory; iterated and then assigned into the storage at the end; could save some gas     ## Proof of Concept  POOL lines #357 to #363   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L357     ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Step1: Above line #358; add in:  uint [] memory _revArray = revenueArray (Get the storage revenueArray and store it in memory)    Step2: change revenueArray.length to _revArray.length    Step3: change:  revenueArray[i] = revenueArray[i - 1]  to:  _revArray[i] = _revArray[i - 1]    Step4: change:  revenueArray[0] = _fee  To:  _revArray[0] = _fee    Step5: add:  revenueArray = _revArray as the final line inside the function
