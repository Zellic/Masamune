# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  There is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:   * ["if answeredInRound < roundId could indicate stale data."](https://docs.chain.link/docs/developer-communications#current-notifications)   * ["A timestamp with zero value means the round is not complete and should not be used."](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data#solidity)   ## Impact  The price oracle might return unreliable price data which can lead to a variety of different issues in the protocol, for example, for liquidating more staker & lender tokens than required at fair market price.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add missing checks for stale data. See example [here](https://github.com/cryptexfinance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L58-L65).
