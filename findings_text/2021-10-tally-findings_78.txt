# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `Swap.sol` inherits OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract which enables the `onlyOwner` role to transfer ownership to another address. It's possible that the `onlyOwner` role mistakenly transfers ownership to the wrong address, resulting in a loss of the `onlyOwner` role.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/main/contracts/governance/EmergencyGovernable.sol https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/main/contracts/swap/Swap.sol  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider overriding the `transferOwnership()` function to first nominate an address as the pending owner and implementing an `acceptOwnership()` function which is called by the pending owner to confirm the transfer. Alternatively, as the `onlyOwner` role is not used throughout the contract, it may be useful to remove this contract entirely from the `EmergencyGovernable.sol` contract.
