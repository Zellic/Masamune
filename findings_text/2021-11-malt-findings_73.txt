# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  ERC20 balanceOf call is costly. Malt balance is read twice in sellMalt call, which isn't needed, so gas is overspent here.  ## Proof of Concept  Malt balanceOf(address(this)) is called twice: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/SwingTrader.sol#L86 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/SwingTrader.sol#L150  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It's recommended to make internal version of costBasis that takes Malt balance as an argument.  Now: ``` uint256 totalMaltBalance = malt.balanceOf(address(this)); ... (...) = costBasis(); ... function costBasis() public view returns (uint256 cost, uint256 decimals) { ... uint256 maltBalance = malt.balanceOf(address(this)); ... ``` To be: ``` uint256 totalMaltBalance = malt.balanceOf(address(this)); ... (...) = _costBasis(totalMaltBalance); ... function _costBasis(uint256 maltBalance) internal view returns (...) { ... function costBasis() public view returns (...) {  return _costBasis(malt.balanceOf(address(this))); } ```
