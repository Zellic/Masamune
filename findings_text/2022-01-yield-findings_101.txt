# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L106-L111  ```solidity     if (rewardsLength == 0) {         RewardType storage reward = rewards.push();         reward.reward_token = crv;         reward.reward_pool = mainPool;         rewardsLength += 1;     } ```  When `rewardsLength` == `0`,  the new `rewardsLength` will always be 1. Therefore, replacing `+=` with `=` can avoid the unnecessary arithmetic operations and memory reads    ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity     if (rewardsLength == 0) {         RewardType storage reward = rewards.push();         reward.reward_token = crv;         reward.reward_pool = mainPool;         rewardsLength = 1;     } ```
