Subsequent call to the same function will send him correct amount.  The same problem applies to all view functions in `ZcToken` contract - they use saved market `maturityRate`, which can be `0` even past deadline time and functions revert or return `0` in this case.  Incorrect withdrawal behaviour:  1. Bob has some `ZcToken`s. 2. Right at the time of maturity Bob tries to withdraw his underlying tokens by calling `ZcToken.withdraw` with some underlying amount. 3. Instead of receiving corresponding amount, Bob receives nothing (but transaction still succeeds and he uses gas for it).  ## Proof of Concept  1. `withdraw`: calculates `previewAmount` from `previewWithdraw`  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/Tokens/ZcToken.sol#L99   2. `previewWithdraw`: multiplication by `maturityRate` returns 0  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/Tokens/ZcToken.sol#L92  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add `getMaturityRate` function to `ZcToken`, which will return either market's `maturityRate` or (if it's `0`) current market's `exchangeRate`. Use this function instead of `maturityRate` everywhere across `ZcToken`.
