# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Tracer protocol like any other allows market creators to charge fees for trades. However, a malicious/greedy owner can arbitrarily change fee to any % value and without an event to observe this change or a timelock to react, there is no easy way for users to monitor this via front-end or off-chain monitoring tools.  Impact: Users trade on a market with 0.1% fees. The owner suddenly changes this to 100%. Users realise this only after their trades are executed. Market loses confidence. Protocol takes a reputational hit.  ## Proof of Concept  See similar Medium-severity finding in ConsenSys's Audit of 1inch Liquidity Protocol (https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/12/1inch-liquidity-protocol/#unpredictable-behavior-for-users-due-to-admin-front-running-or-general-bad-timing  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L548-L550  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L198-L214  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Emit event, provide time lock for users to react and establish an upper threshold for fees that is decided across markets by governance.
