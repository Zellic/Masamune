# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact .length in a loop can be extracted into a variable and used where necessary to reduce the number of storage reads. An example where this could be applied:   for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarkets.length; i++) Solution:   uint moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;   for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) Cache the length of the array and use this local variable when iterating over the storage array.
