# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The fee growth mechanism, and by extension, secondsPerLiquidity mechanism of Uniswap V3 has the ability to underflow. It is therefore a necessity for the math to (ironically) be unsafe / unchecked.   ### Proof of Concept  Assume the following scenario and initial conditions:  - Price at parity (nearestTick is 0) - tickSpacing of 10 - Swaps only increase the price (nearestTick moves up only) - feeGrowthGlobal initializes with 0, increases by 1 for every tick moved for simplicity - Existing positions that provide enough liquidity and enable nearestTick to be set to values in the example - Every tick initialized in the example is ≤ nearestTick, so that its feeGrowthOutside = feeGrowthGlobal  1. When nearestTick is at 40, Alice creates a position for uninitialised ticks [-20, 30]. The ticks are initialized, resulting in their feeGrowthOutside values to be set to 40. 2. nearestTick moves to 50. Bob creates a position with ticks [20, 30] (tick 20 is uninitialised, 30 was initialized from Alice's mint). tick 20 will therefore have a feeGrowthOutside of 50. 3. Let us calculate `rangeFeeGrowth(20,30)`.     - lowerTick = 20, upperTick = 30     - feeGrowthBelow = 50 (lowerTick's feeGrowthOutside) since lowerTick < currentTick     - feeGrowthAbove = 50 - 40 = 10 (feeGrowthGlobal - upperTick's feeGrowthOutside) since upperTick < currentTick     - feeGrowthInside                  = feeGrowthGlobal - feeGrowthBelow - feeGrowthAbove                  = 50 - 50 - 10                  = -10           We therefore have negative feeGrowthInside.  This behaviour is actually acceptable, because the important thing about this mechanism is the relative values to each other, not the absolute values themselves.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  `rangeFeeGrowth()` and `rangeSecondsInside()` has to be unchecked. In addition, the subtraction of feeGrowthInside values should also be unchecked in `_updatePosition()` and `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition#collect()`.  The same also applies for the subtraction of `pool.rangeSecondsInside` and `stake.secondsInsideLast` in `claimReward()` and `getReward()` of the `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager` contract.
