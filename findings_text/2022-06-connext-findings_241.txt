If the proposition can be falsified, the contract admins can exploit the contract in any way of their choice.  ## Proof of Concept To determine the id of the proposal, only its facet changes are hashed, skipping two critical pieces of data - the `_init` and `_calldata`. During a diamond upgrade, devs can choose what code will be executed **by the contract using a delegatecall**. Thus, they can make the contract perform **any** actions of their choice.  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add `_init` and `_calldata` to the proposition hash.
