# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  This does not directly impact the smart contract in anyway besides cost. This is a gas optimization to reduce cost of smart contract. Calling each function, we can see that the public function uses 496 gas, while the external function uses only 261.  ## Proof of Concept  According to Slither Analyzer documentation (https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#public-function-that-could-be-declared-external), there are functions in the contract that are never called. These functions should be declared as external in order to save gas.  Slither Detector:  external-function:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L75  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Clone repository for Mochi Smart Contracts. 2. Create a python virtual environment with a stable python version. 3. Install Slither Analyzer on the python VEM. 4. Run Slither against all contracts. 5. Define public functions as an external for the gas optimization.
