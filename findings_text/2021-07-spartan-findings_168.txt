# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `SynthVault.withdraw` function does not claim the user's rewards. It decreases the user's weight and therefore they are forfeiting their accumulated rewards. The `synthReward` variable in `_processWithdraw` is also never used - it was probably intended that this variable captures the claimed rewards.  ## Impact Usually, withdrawal functions claim rewards first but this one does not. A user that withdraws loses all their accumulated rewards.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Claim the rewards with the user's deposited balance first in `withdraw`.
