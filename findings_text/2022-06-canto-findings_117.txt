The following below are impacts arising from above: ## A. Users can gain underlying asset tokens for free by minting CToken in `mintFresh()` then calling `redeemFresh()`  ## Proof of Concept 1. Alice calls `_setAccountantContract()` with parameter input as 0. 2. The _accountant state variable is now 0. 3. Alice/or a contract calls `mintFresh()` with input address 0 and mintAmount 1000. (assuming function is external, reporting a separate issue on the mutability) 4. This passes the `if (minter == address(_accountant))` and proceeds to mint 1000 CTokens to address(0) 5. Alice then calls `redeemFresh()` with her address as the `redeemer` parameter, and redeemTokensIn as 1000. 6. Assume exchangeRate is 1, Alice would receive 1000 tokens in underlying asset.    ## B. Users could borrow CToken asset for free A user can borrow CToken asset from the contract, then set _accountant to 0 after. With _accountant being set to 0 , the borrower , then call `repayBorrowFresh()` to have _accountant (address 0) to repay back the borrowed tokens assuming address(0) already has some tokens, and user's borrowed asset (all/part) are repaid.  ## Proof of Concept 1. Alice calls `borrowFresh()` to borrow 500 CTokens from contract. 2. Then Alice calls `_setAccountantContract()` with parameter input as 0. 2. The _accountant state variable is now 0. 3. With _accountant being set to 0, Alice calls `repayBorrowFresh()` having the payer be address 0, borrower being her address and 500 as repayAmount. 4. Assume address 0 already holds 1000 CTokens, Alice's debt will be fully repaid and she'll gain 500 CTokens for free.   ## C. Accounting contract could loses funds/tokens When the _accountant is set to 0, CTokens/CNote will be sent to the zero address making the Accounting contract lose funds whenever  `doTransferOut` is called.    ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Instead of a `if (address(_accountant) != address(0))` statement, an additional require check to ensure `accountant_` parameter is not 0 address can be used in addition to the require check for caller is admin.  Change this  ```if (address(_accountant) != address(0)){             require(msg.sender == admin, "CNote::_setAccountantContract:Only admin may call this function");         } ```  to this ``` require(msg.sender == admin, "CNote::_setAccountantContract:Only admin may call this function"); require(accountant_ != address(0), "accoutant can't be zero address"); ```
