# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  The DeletedNewIndex log emits "publisher", but it might be the auction that called the function. Note: the event is defined as: event DeletedNewIndex(address _publisher); So if you wanted to anyway emit just the publisher, this is not a bug. However as this function call be called from both publisher and auction, I have a feeling you wanted to emit the msg.sender.  ## Impact Inaccurate data supplied.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L208  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit msg.sender instead of publisher.
