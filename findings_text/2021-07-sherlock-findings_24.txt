# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function payout contains an expression with 3 sequential divs. This is generally not recommended because it could lead to rounding errors / loss of precision. Also a div is usually more expensive than a mul. Also an intermediate division by 0 (if SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply) == 0) could occur.  ## Proof of Concept //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/Payout.sol#L108 function payout( ..  uint256 deduction =  excludeUsd.div(curTotalUsdPool.div(SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply)).div(10e17);  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Verify the formula and replace with something like: uint256 deduction =  excludeUsd.mul(SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply).div(  curTotalUsdPool.mul(10e17) )
