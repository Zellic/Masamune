The capacity to be swapped at these prices is usually very large, so it must make sure to only be enabled when the prices are guaranteed to be synced. However, there is no such check. If beat() is not called for some time, meaning we cannot determine if the current spread is legit, swap() still operates as usual.   ## Impact The worst case scenario is that the wall is swapping at a losing price, meaning they can be immediately drained via arbitrage bot.   ## Proof of concept  1. Price is X at the start  2. Oracle stops updating for some reason / no one calls beat()  3. Price drops to Y , where Y < low wall centered around X  4. Attacker can perform arbitrage by buying Ohm at external markets at Y and selling Ohm at low wall price, netting the difference.  ## Recommended mitigation steps: Change modifier onlyWhileActive to add a check for beat out of sync: ``` if (block.timestamp > lastBeat + SYNC_THRESHOLD * frequency()) ```
