And it will revert when `amount * sale.price >= type(uint72).max` and such cases would be likely to happen e.g. `amount = 64(so 2^6), sale.price = 73 * 10^18(so 2^66)`.  As a result, `buy()` might revert when it should work properly.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We should modify like below.  ```solidity     require(uint256(amount) * sale.price == msg.value, "WRONG PRICE"); ```
