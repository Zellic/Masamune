# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Function `RewardReinvestor::_bondAccount` tries to bond liquidity to an account, even though it is known whether the liquidity is zero.  ## Proof of Concept  The return value `liquidityCreated` in [line 105](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/RewardReinvestor.sol#L105) can be zero. The following function call, `bondToAccount()`, then reverts with "Cannot bond 0".  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Gas could be saved if the function would revert earlier, i.e. in [line 106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/RewardReinvestor.sol#L106), if the `liquidityCreated` is zero.
