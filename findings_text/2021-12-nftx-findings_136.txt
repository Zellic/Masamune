# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `NFTXInventoryStaking` contract distributes new rewards to all previous stakers when the owner calls the `receiveRewards` function. This allows an attacker to frontrun this `receiveRewards` transaction when they see it in the mem pool with a `deposit` function. The attacker will receive the rewards pro-rata to their deposits. The deposit will be locked for 2 seconds only (`DEFAULT_LOCKTIME`) after which the depositor can withdraw their initial deposit & the rewards again for a profit.  The rewards can be gamed this way and one does not actually have to _stake_, only be in the staking contract at the time of reward distribution for 2 seconds. The rest of the time they can be used for other purposes.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Distribute the rewards equally over time to the stakers instead of in a single chunk on each `receiveRewards` call. This is more of a "streaming rewards" approach.
