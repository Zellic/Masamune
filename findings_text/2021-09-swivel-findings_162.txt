# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are multiple instances of divisions performed before multiplications, whereas the opposite is generally suggested. To mitigate the precision loss, a factor like `1e18` is multiplied and then divided, but this solution is arbitrary and can be avoided.  For example: ```js uint256 principalFilled = (((a * 1e18) / o.premium) * o.principal) / 1e18; ```  can be rewritten like: ```js uint256 principalFilled = a * o.principal / o.premium; ```  ## Proof of Concept Run `grep '1e18' Swivel.sol` for a complete list.  ## Tools Used grep, editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Suggested checking all instances and trying to simplify the math.
