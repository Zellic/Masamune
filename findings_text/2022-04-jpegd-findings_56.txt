# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol#L169-L170   # Vulnerability details  ## Details & Impact  yVault users participating in the farm have to trust that:  - `vault.balanceOfJPEG()`  returns the correct claimable JPEG amount by its strategy / strategies - the strategy / strategies will send all claimable JPEG to the farm  Should either of these assumptions break, then it could be possibly be the case that `currentBalance` is less than `previousBalance`, causing deposits and crucially, withdrawals to fail due to subtraction overflow.  ## Proof of Concept  For instance,   - Farm migration occurs. A new farm is set in `yVault`, then `withdrawJPEG()` is called, which sends funds to the new farm. Users of the old farm would be unable to withdraw their deposits.  ```jsx it.only("will revert old farms' deposits and withdrawals if yVault migrates farm", async () => {   // 0. setup   await token.mint(owner.address, units(1000));   await token.approve(yVault.address, units(1000));   await yVault.depositAll();   await yVault.approve(lpFarming.address, units(1000));   // send some JPEG to strategy prior to deposit   await jpeg.mint(strategy.address, units(100));   // deposit twice, so that the second deposit will invoke _update()   await lpFarming.deposit(units(250));   await lpFarming.deposit(units(250));     // 1. change farm and call withdrawJPEG()   await yVault.setFarmingPool(user1.address);   await yVault.withdrawJPEG();     // deposit and withdrawal will fail   await expect(lpFarming.deposit(units(500))).to.be.revertedWith('reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)');   await expect(lpFarming.withdraw(units(500))).to.be.revertedWith('reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)'); }); ```  - Strategy migration occurs, but JPEG funds held by the old strategy were not claimed, causing `vault.balanceOfJPEG()` to report a smaller amount than previously recorded - `jpeg` could be accidentally included in the StrategyConfig, resulting in JPEG being converted to other assets - A future implementation takes a fee on the `jpeg` to be claimed  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  A simple fix would be to `return` if `currentBalance ≤ previousBalance`. A full fix would properly handle potential shortfall.  ```jsx if (currentBalance <= previousBalance) return; ```
