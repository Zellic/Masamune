# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/splits/contracts/Splitter.sol#L149-L169   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In general, the Splitter contract's incrementWindow function is only called when tokens are transfer to the contract, ensuring that the number of tokens stored in balanceForWindow is equal to the contract balance. However, anyone can use a fake RoyaltyVault contract to call the incrementWindow function of the Splitter contract, so that the amount of tokens stored in balanceForWindow is greater than the contract balance, after which the verified user can call the claim or claimForAllWindows functions to steal the tokens in the contract. ```     function incrementWindow(uint256 royaltyAmount) public returns (bool) {         uint256 wethBalance;          require(             IRoyaltyVault(msg.sender).supportsInterface(IID_IROYALTY),             "Royalty Vault not supported"         );         require(             IRoyaltyVault(msg.sender).getSplitter() == address(this),             "Unauthorised to increment window"         );          wethBalance = IERC20(splitAsset).balanceOf(address(this));         require(wethBalance >= royaltyAmount, "Insufficient funds");          require(royaltyAmount > 0, "No additional funds for window");         balanceForWindow.push(royaltyAmount);         currentWindow += 1;         emit WindowIncremented(currentWindow, royaltyAmount);         return true;     } ``` ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/splits/contracts/Splitter.sol#L149-L169 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the onlyRoyaltyVault modifier to the incrementWindow function of the Splitter contract to ensure that only RoyaltyVault contracts with a specific address can call this function.
