# Handle  tensors   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact After swapping a yield source, the old yield source still has infinite approval. Infinite approval has been used in large attacks if the yield source isn't perfectly safe (see furucombo).  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L268  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Decrease approval after swapping the yield source.
