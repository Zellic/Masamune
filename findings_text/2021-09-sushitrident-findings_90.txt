# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `TridentHelper.withdrawFromWETH` (used in `TridentRouter.unwrapWETH`) function performs a low-level call to `WETH.withdraw(amount)`.  It then checks if the return `data` length is more or equal to `32` bytes, however `WETH.withdraw` returns `void` and has a return value of `0`. Thus, the function always reverts even if `success == true`.  ```solidity function withdrawFromWETH(uint256 amount) internal {     // @audit WETH.withdraw returns nothing, data.length always zero. this always reverts     require(success && data.length >= 32, "WITHDRAW_FROM_WETH_FAILED"); } ```  ## Impact The `unwrapWETH` function is broken and makes all transactions revert. Batch calls to the router cannot perform any unwrapping of WETH.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the `data.length >= 32` from the require and only check if `success` is true.
