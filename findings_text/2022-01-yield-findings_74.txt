# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact No protection from reentrancy (besides the gas limit on safeTransfer). Bad practice compared to the original `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract.  ## Proof of Concept The original `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract used the `nonReentrant` modifier on all functions using the `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` methods: - `deposit`: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L337 - `stake`: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L352  - `withdraw`: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L367 - `withdrawAndUnwrap`: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L381  As the current one in the Yield solution is an upgrade, it should follow the same good practices.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the `nonReentrant` modifier on external functions that end up calling `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` (`user_checkpoint()` and `getReward()`)
