# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  The reserves should be updated once LP tokens are burned to match the actual total bento shares hold by the pool.  However, the current implementation only updated reserves with the fees subtracted.  Makes the `reserve0` and `reserve1` smaller than the current `balance0` and `balance1`.  ## Impact  As a result, many essential features of the contract will malfunction, includes `swap()` and `mint()`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L263-L267  Change:  ```         unchecked {             reserve0 -= uint128(amount0fees);             reserve1 -= uint128(amount1fees);         }  ``` to:  ```         unchecked {             reserve0 -= uint128(amount0);             reserve1 -= uint128(amount1);         } ```
