However, for the other keys it makes no reason not to use the up to date accumulatedETHPerLPShare value.  ## Impact  User receives less rewards than they are eligible for if first passed BLS key is inactive.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Call updateAccumulatedETHPerLP() at the start of the function.
