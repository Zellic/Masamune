However if the admin ```withdraw(eToken)``` first, the balance of eToken in ```Lender.sol``` will equal to zero while ```fees[eToken]``` remains the same and ```withdrawFee(eToken)``` will become unfunctioning since eToken in the contract does not match ```fees[eToken]```. The admin will need to rely on ```withdraw```, which takes 3 days before transfering, to get the future fees of eToken.  ### Mitigations add ```fees[eToken] = 0;``` after ```withdrawals[e] = 0;```  in ```withdraw```.
