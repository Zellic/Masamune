# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Only ERC20 tokens with a decimals() function can be used as a depositToken. A stream creator maybe not be aware of this restriction and the creation of a stream would revert.  ## Proof of Concept In the constructor of the Stream contract the decimals() (L310) functions of the depositToken is called. But according to EIP20 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) the decimals() function is optional.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L310  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - clearly inform the stream creator that the depositToken needs to have the decimals() function implemented
