# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  In the `receive` function of `FeeSplitter` we check that the address sending ETH is the WETH contract: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L74  As we can safely say that the WETH contract will never send a metatransaction, we can just use msg.sender and avoid the extra gas costs of `_msgSender()`  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace `_msgSender()` with `msg.sender`
