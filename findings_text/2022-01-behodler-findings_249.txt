# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  No events in Limbo, LimboDAO and FlashGovernanceArbiter contracts are indexed, so their filtering is disabled, which makes it harder to programmatically use the system  ## Proof of Concept  Contract's events don't have indices:  Limbo:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/Limbo.sol#L253-260  FlashGovernanceArbiter:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L22  LimboDAO:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/LimboDAO.sol#L56-61  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding the indices to the key parameters, first of all to the addresses of the tokens and accounts broadcasted
