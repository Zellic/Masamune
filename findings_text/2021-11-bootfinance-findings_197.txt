# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas overspending due to excessive external function calls  ## Proof of Concept  SwapUtils's addLiquidity function calls LP token totalSupply() several times: 6 code occurrences, one is in cycle. The very last occurrency should be kept as it is, the first 5 of them should be replaced with memory variable as the supply changes only once when LP mint() is called at the end of the function. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L1163  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Code update:  Now: if (self.lpToken.totalSupply() != 0) { ...  To be: uint256 lpTotalSupply = self.lpToken.totalSupply(); // storage read and function call if (lpTotalSupply != 0) { ...
