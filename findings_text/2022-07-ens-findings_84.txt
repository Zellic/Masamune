This makes it possible, for example, to unwrap the subdomain, but owner and fuses will still be set even for unwrapped domain, creating fake `ERC1155` `NameWrapper` token for domain, which is not owned by `NameWrapper`.  Fake token creation scenario:  1. `Account1` registers and wraps `test.eth` domain 2. `Account1` calls `NameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner` for `sub.test.eth` subdomain with `Account1` as owner (to make NameWrapper owner of subdomain) 3. `Contract1` smart contract is created, which calls unwrap in its `onERC1155Received` function, and a function to send `sub.test.eth` ERC1155 NameWrapper token back to `Account1` 4. `Account1` calls `NameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner` for `sub.test.eth` with `Contract1` as new owner, which unwraps domain back to `Account1` but due to re-entrancy, NameWrapper sets fuses and ownership to `Contract1` 5. `Account1` calls function to send ERC1155 token from `Contract1` back to self.  After this sequence of events, `sub.test.eth` subdomain is owned by `Account1` both in `ENS` registry and in `NameWrapper` (with fuses and expiry correctly set to the future date). Lots (but not all) of functions in `NameWrapper` will fail to execute for this subdomain, because they expect `NameWrapper` to have ownership of the domain in `ENS`, but some functions will still work, making it possible to make the impression of good domain.  At this point, ownership in `NameWrapper` is "detached" from ownership in `ENS` and `Account1` can do all kinds of malcious stuff with its ERC1155 token. For example:  1. Sell subdomain to the other user, transfering `ERC1155` to that user and burning `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` to create impression that he can't control the domain. After receiving the payment, `Account1` can wrap the domain again, which burns existing ownership record and replaces with the new one with clear fuses and `Account1` ownership, effectively stealing domain back from unsuspecting user, who thought that `ERC1155` gives him the right to the domain (and didn't expect that parent can clear fuses when `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` is set).  2. Transfer subdomain to some other smart contract, which implements `onERC1155Received`, then take it back, fooling smart contract into believing that it has received the domain.   ## Proof of Concept  Copy these to test/wrapper and run: yarn test test/wrapper/NameWrapperReentrancy.js  https://gist.github.com/panprog/3cd94e3fbb0c52410a4c6609e55b863e   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding `nonReentrant` modifiers with `ReentrancyGuard` implementation from `openzeppelin`. Alternatively just fix this individual re-entrancy issue. There are multiple ways to fix it depending on expected behaviour, for example saving `ERC1155` data and requiring it to match the data after transfer (restricting `onERC1155Received` to not change any data for the token received):      function _transferAndBurnFuses(         bytes32 node,         address newOwner,         uint32 fuses,         uint64 expiry     ) internal {         (address owner, uint32 saveFuses, uint64 saveExpiry) = getData(uint256(node));         _transfer(owner, newOwner, uint256(node), 1, "");         uint32 curFuses;         uint64 curExpiry;         (owner, curFuses, curExpiry) = getData(uint256(node));         require(owner == newOwner && saveFuses == curFuses && saveExpiry == curExpiry);         _setFuses(node, newOwner, fuses, expiry);     }
