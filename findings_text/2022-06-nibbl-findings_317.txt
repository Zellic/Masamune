But the `ERC721` implementation used is not upgradeable, and its constructor is called at deployment time on the implementation. So all proxies will have a void name and symbol, breaking all potential integrations and listings.  ## Proof of Concept `ERC721("NFT Basket", "NFTB")` is called at deployment time, and sets private variable at the implementation level. Therefore when loading the code during `delegateCall`, these variables will not be initialized.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The easiest mitigation would be to pass this variable as immutable so they are hardcoded in the implementation byte code.
