# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function getRouterImplementation of Router.sol checks the selectors of functions and calls the appropriate function. Selectors are only 4 bytes long so there is a theoretical probability of a collision (e.g. two functions having the same selector).  This is comparable to the "birthday attack" : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack The probability of a collision when you have 93 different functions is 10^−6. Due to the structure of the Router.sol, the solidity compiler does not prevent collisions  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/Router.sol#L97 ```JS   function getRouterImplementation(bytes4 sig) public view returns (address) {         if (             sig == NotionalProxy.batchBalanceAction.selector ||             sig == NotionalProxy.batchBalanceAndTradeAction.selector ||      ...  ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Double check (perhaps via a continuous integration script / github workflow), that there are no collisions of the selectors.
