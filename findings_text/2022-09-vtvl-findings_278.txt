The balance could become insufficient at the time of `withdraw()`. User's fund will be locked due to DoS. The way to take the fund out is to send more token into the contract, causing fund loss to the protocol. And there is no guarantee that until the end time the balance would stay above the needed amount, the lock and loss issue persist.    ## Proof of Concept  For stETH like tokens, the `balanceOf()` value might go up or down, even without transfer. ```solidity // stETH     function balanceOf(address who) external override view returns (uint256) {         return _shareBalances[who].div(_sharesPerToken);     } ```  In `VTVLVesting`, the `require` check for the spot `balanceOf()` value will pass, but it is possible that as time goes on, the value become smaller and fail the transfer. As a result, the `withdraw()` call will revert, causing DoS, and lock user's fund. ```solidity // contracts/VTVLVesting.sol     function _createClaimUnchecked() private  hasNoClaim(_recipient) {         // ...         require(tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) >= numTokensReservedForVesting + allocatedAmount, "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");         // ...     }      function withdraw() hasActiveClaim(_msgSender()) external {         // ...         tokenAddress.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amountRemaining);         // ...     } ```   #### Reference https://etherscan.io/address/0x312ca0592a39a5fa5c87bb4f1da7b77544a91b87#code   ## Tools Used Manual analysis.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Disallow such kind of variable balance token.
