# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `Pool` allows users to burn lp tokens without withdrawing the tokens. This allows the hacker to mutate the pools' rate to a point that no one can get any lp token anymore (even if depositing token).  The liquidity tokens are calculated at `Utils:calcLiquidityUnits` ```             // units = ((P (t B + T b))/(2 T B)) * slipAdjustment             // P * (part1 + part2) / (part3) * slipAdjustment             uint slipAdjustment = getSlipAdustment(b, B, t, T);             uint part1 = t*(B);             uint part2 = T*(b);             uint part3 = T*(B)*(2);             uint _units = (P * (part1 + (part2))) / (part3);             return _units * slipAdjustment / one;  // Divide by 10**18 ``` where `P` stands for `totalSupply` of current Pool. If `P` is too small (e.g, 1) then all the units would be rounding to 0.  Since any person can create a `Pool` at `PoolFactory`, hackers can create a Pool and burn his lp and set `totalSupply` to 1. He will be the only person who owns the Pool's lp from now on.  ## Proof of Concept Pool's burn logic: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L146  Utils' lp token formula: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Utils.sol#L80  Here's a script of a user depositing 1M token to a pool where `totalSupply` equals 1  ``` dai_pool.functions.burn(init_amount-1).transact() print('total supply', dai_pool.functions.totalSupply().call()) dai.functions.transfer(dai_pool.address, 1000000 * 10**18).transact() dai_pool.functions.addForMember(user).transact() print('lp received from depositing 1M dai: ', dai_pool.functions.balanceOf(user).call()) ```  Output: ``` total supply 1 lp received from depositing 1M dai:  0 ``` ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove `burn` or restrict it to privileged users only.
