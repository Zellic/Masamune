# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `PrizePool` contract does not implement the `onERC721Received` function, which is considered a best practice to transfer ERC721 tokens from contracts to contracts. The absence of this function could prevent `PrizePool` from receiving ERC721 tokens from other contracts via `safeTransferFrom`.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [PrizePool.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/PrizePool.sol)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding an implementation of the `onERC721Received` function in `PrizePool`.
