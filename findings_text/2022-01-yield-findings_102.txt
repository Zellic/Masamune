By storing the original value once again, a refund is triggered (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200).  Since refunds are capped to a percentage of the total transaction's gas, it is best to keep them low, to increase the likelihood of the full refund coming into effect.  Therefore, switching between 1, 2 instead of 0, 1 will be more gas efficient.
