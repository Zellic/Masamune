# Handle  throttle   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `quoteAmount` return value  ## Proof of Concept Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price and round completeness. Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `quoteAmount` return value ```javascript function _peek(     bytes6 base,     bytes6 quote,     uint256 baseAmount ) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 updateTime) {     ...
