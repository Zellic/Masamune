NFT may be lost.  ## Proof of Concept ```solidity function executeJob(bytes calldata bridgeInRequestPayload) external payable { ... delete _operatorJobs[hash]; ...     try       HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(         msg.sender,         bridgeInRequestPayload       )     {       /// @dev do nothing     } catch {       _failedJobs[hash] = true;       emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);     } } ```  First, it will `delete _operatorJobs[hash];` to have it not replayable.  Next, assume nonRevertingBridgeCall failed. NFT won't be minted and the catch block is entered.  _failedJobs[hash] is set to true and event is emitted  Notice that _operatorJobs[hash] has been deleted, so this job is not replayable. This mean NFT is lost forever since we can't retry executeJob.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Move `delete _operatorJobs[hash];` to the end of function executeJob covered in `if (!_failedJobs[hash])`  ```solidity ... if (!_failedJobs[hash]) delete _operatorJobs[hash]; ... ```  But this implementation is not safe. The selected operator may get slashed. Additionally, you may need to check _failedJobs flag to allow retry for only the selected operator.
