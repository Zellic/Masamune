# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details   When suppling to the `BadgerYieldSource`, some `amount` of `badger` is deposited to `badgerSett` and one receives `badgerSett` share tokens in return which are stored in the `balances` mapping of the user. So far this is correct.  The `balanceOfToken` function should then return the redeemable balance in `badger` for the user's `badgerSett` balance. It computes it as the pro-rata share of the user balance (compared to the total-supply of `badgerSett`) on the `badger` in the vault:  ```solidity balances[addr].mul(   badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett)) ).div(   badgerSett.totalSupply() ) ```  However, `badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))` is only a small amount of badger that is deployed in the vault ("Sett") due to most of the capital being deployed to the _strategies_. Therefore, it under-reports the actual balance:  > Typically, a Sett will keep a small portion of deposited funds in reserve to handle small withdrawals cheaply. [Badger Docs](https://badger-finance.gitbook.io/badger-finance/technical/setts/sett-contract)  ## Impact  Any contract or user calling the `balanceOf` function will receive a value that is far lower than the actual balance. Using this value as a basis for computations will lead to further errors in the integrations.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It should use [`badgerSett.balance()`](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-system/blob/2b0ee9bd77a2cc6f875b9b984ae4dfe713bbc55c/contracts/badger-sett/Sett.sol#L126) instead of `badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))` to also account for "the balance in the Sett, the Controller, and the Strategy".
