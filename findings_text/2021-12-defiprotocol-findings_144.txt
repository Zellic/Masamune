# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  The function is implemented as follows:  ``` function auctionBurn(uint256 amount) onlyAuction nonReentrant external override {         uint256 startSupply = totalSupply();         handleFees(startSupply);         _burn(msg.sender, amount);          uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * startSupply / (startSupply - amount);         ibRatio = newIbRatio;          emit NewIBRatio(newIbRatio);         emit Burned(msg.sender, amount);     } ```  When `handleFees` is called, `totalSupply` and `ibRatio` changes accordingly, but for `newIbRatio` calculation tokens minted in `handleFees` is not included. Therefore, `ibRatio` is calculated higher than it should be. This is dangerous, since last withdrawing user(s) lose their funds with this operation. In case this miscalculation happens more than once, `newIbRatio` will increase the miscalculation even faster and can result in serious amount of funds missing. At each time `auctionBurn` is called, at least 1 day (auction duration) of fees result in this miscalculation. Furthermore, all critical logic of this contract is based on `ibRatio`, this behaviour can create serious miscalculations.   ## Mitigation step  Rather than  `uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * startSupply / (startSupply - amount);`  A practical solution to this problem is calculating `newIbRatio` as follows:  ``` uint256 supply = totalSupply(); uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * (supply + amount) / supply; ```
