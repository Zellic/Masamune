# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD()` function of `SherX` should return `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD(getSherXBalance())` instead of `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD(sx20.balances[msg.sender])` since there could be SherX unallocated to the user at the time of the function call. A similar function, `calcUnderlying()`, calculates the user's underlying tokens based on the user's current balance plus the unallocated ones.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [SherX.sol#L141](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/SherX.sol#L141)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change `sx20.balances[msg.sender]` to `getSherXBalance()` at line 141.
