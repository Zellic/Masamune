Thus, the result of the `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw` should be rounded up.  ## Proof-of-Concept  The current implementation of `convertToShares` function will round down the number of shares returned due to how solidity handles Integer Division. ERC4626 expects the returned value of `convertToShares` to be rounded down. Thus, this function behaves as expected.  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L52)  ```solidity function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {     uint256 supply = totalSupply();     if (supply == 0) {         // Scales assets by the value of a single unit of fCash         uint256 unitfCashValue = _getPresentValue(uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION));         return (assets * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / unitfCashValue;     }      return (assets * totalSupply()) / totalAssets(); } ```  ERC 4626 expects the result returned from `previewWithdraw` function to be rounded up. However, within the `previewWithdraw` function, it calls the `convertToShares` function. Recall earlier that the `convertToShares` function returned a rounded down value,  thus `previewWithdraw` will return a rounded down value instead of round up value. Thus, this function does not behave as expected.

Due to the nature of time-boxed contest, I was unable to verify if `NotionalV2.getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal` and `NotionalV2.getDepositFromfCashLend` functions return a rounded down or up value. If a rounded down value is returned from these functions, `previewWithdraw` and `previewMint` functions would not behave as expected.  ## Impact  Other protocols that integrate with Notional's fCash wrapper might wrongly assume that the functions handle rounding as per ERC4626 expectation. Thus, it might cause some intergration problem in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure that the rounding of vault's functions behave as expected. Following are the expected rounding direction for each vault function:  - previewMint(uint256 shares) - Round Up ⬆  - previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) - Round Up ⬆  - previewRedeem(uint256 shares) - Round Down ⬇  - previewDeposit(uint256 assets) - Round Down ⬇  - convertToAssets(uint256 shares) - Round Down ⬇  - convertToShares(uint256 assets) - Round Down ⬇  `previewMint` returns the  amount of assets that would be deposited to mint specific amount of shares. Thus, the amount of assets must be rounded up, so that the vault won't be shortchanged.  `previewWithdraw` returns the amount of shares that would be burned to withdraw specific amount of asset. Thus, the amount of shares must to be rounded up, so that the vault won't be shortchanged.  Following is the OpenZeppelin's vault implementation for rounding reference:  [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20TokenizedVault.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20TokenizedVault.sol)  Alternatively, if such alignment of rounding could not be achieved due to technical limitation, at the minimum, document this limitation in the comment so that the developer performing the integration is aware of this.
