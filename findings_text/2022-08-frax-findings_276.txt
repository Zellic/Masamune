And these constants are used to calculate rate in rate calculator and also used to reset interest rate when there are no borrows.  But actually, [the merge is really near](https://ethereum.org/vi/upgrades/merge/) and after the merge blocks come exactly each 12 seconds which basically makes all these constants wrong.   This resulted in wrong interest rate after reseting when there are no borrows and wrong rate returned by rate calculators.  ## Proof of Concept  These annual rate is calculated by solving an equation for `r` with an assumption 365.24 days per year and 15s blocks. For example, this is for the 0.5% annual rate ``` 1.005 = (1 + 15*r)^(365.24 * 24 * 3600 / 15) ```   But actually after the merge, blocks come in exactly each 12 seconds.

For example, [line 72-74](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/c4189a3a98b38c8c962c5ea72f1a322fbc2ae45f/src/contracts/VariableInterestRate.sol#L72-L74) used `MIN_INT` as new interest rate ```solidity if (_newRatePerSec < MIN_INT) {     _newRatePerSec = MIN_INT; } ```  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider to update these constants with an assumption that block time is 12 seconds.
