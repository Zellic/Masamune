# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There are places across contracts where the same external calls are made multiple times within a function. Caching return values of such calls in local/memory variables avoids CALLs to save gas. CALLs cost 2600 gas after Berlin upgrade. MLOADs cost only 3 gas units.  ## Proof of Concept  Cache factory.ownerSplit() return value to save 2600 gas in this function which gets called at every mint/burn.: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L120-L121  Hoist basketAsERC20.totalSupply() external call out of the loop because it remains the same and each call costs 2600 gas: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L96-L99  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Cache return values of external calls in local/memory variables
