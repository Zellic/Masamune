However there are some settings that if set incorrectly will block proposals from being created or succeeding and block auctions from completing.  This vulnerability has a low likelihood of occurrence as the outcome is not in the interest of the community. However the possibility exists if there is some misunderstanding or miscalculation. If a bad setting is allowed the impact is high.  ## Proof of Concept  ### Bricking governance proposals  **Governor settings.quorumThresholdBps > 10_000**  If `quorumThresholdBps` is set above 10_000 then it would be impossible to get enough votes to succeed.  Without being able to execute a proposal the setting itself could never be fixed.  **Governor settings.proposalThresholdBps > 10_000**  If `proposalThresholdBps` is set above 10_000 then it would be impossible to submit a proposal.  Without being able to submit a proposal the setting itself could never be fixed.  ### Stalling a governance proposal  **Treasury settings.delay**  A very large value for `delay` would prevent a proposal from being executed.  For example 1000 years easily fits into `delay` and would result in a 1000 year wait before being able to execute.  A governance proposal could fix this property for future proposals but any proposal created with the large `delay` would remain stuck.  ### Stalling the auction  **Auction settings.duration**  The `duration` value is in seconds and any value up to type(uint40).max is permitted.  That is `1099511627775` seconds which is > 48000 years.  A large value like this would stop the auction from ever ending and thus stop new NFTs from being minted.  A governance proposal could fix this setting but ideally a very large `duration` would be blocked.  **Auction settings.timeBuffer**  Similar to duration but applies to the auction endTime extention.  So the auction could be extended a number of years for example.  ## Tools Used  Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement reasonable range bounds reverting where appropriate. In particular for the above apply: - Governor settings `quorumThresholdBps` <= 10_000 - Governor settings `proposalThresholdBps` <= 10_000 - Treasury settings `delay` <= 6 months - Auction settings `duration` <= 6 months - Auction settings `timeBuffer` <= 6 months  Add these checks to the `initialize()` functions and in the setter / update functions where these individual settings properties can be updated.
