# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The function `_depositToAave` of `ATokenYieldSource` calls `_lendingPool` and `_tokenAddress` twice, both of which include function calls to external contracts. Thus, storing the first results into local variables and reuse them for the second time could help save gas.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [ATokenYieldSource.sol#L175-L182](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-yield-source/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/ATokenYieldSource.sol#L175-L182)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Store the result of `_tokenAddress()` and `_lendingPool()` to local variables and resue them.
