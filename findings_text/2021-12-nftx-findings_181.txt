# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `changeReceiverAlloc` did not check if the idx exists unlike other functions in the same contract  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/194073f750b7e2c9a886ece34b6382b4f1355f36/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXSimpleFeeDistributor.sol#L93 ```   function changeReceiverAlloc(uint256 _receiverIdx, uint256 _allocPoint) public override virtual onlyOwner {     FeeReceiver storage feeReceiver = feeReceivers[_receiverIdx];     allocTotal -= feeReceiver.allocPoint;     feeReceiver.allocPoint = _allocPoint;     allocTotal += _allocPoint;     emit UpdateFeeReceiverAlloc(feeReceiver.receiver, _allocPoint);   } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps ```require(_receiverIdx < feeReceivers.length, "FeeDistributor: Out of bounds");```
