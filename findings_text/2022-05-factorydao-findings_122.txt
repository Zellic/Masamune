If the gas costs of functions change between when deposits are made and when rewards are withdrawn, or if the gas cost of the deposit (`transferFrom()`) is less than the gas cost of the withdrawal (`transfer()`), then the `withdraw()` function may revert due to exceeding the block size gas limit.  ## Proof of Concept `transfer()` is an external call, and `rewards.length` has no maximum size: ```solidity File: contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol   #1  224           for (uint i = 0; i < rewards.length; i++) { 225               pool.rewardsWeiClaimed[i] += rewards[i]; 226               pool.rewardFunding[i] -= rewards[i]; 227               uint tax = (pool.taxPerCapita * rewards[i]) / 1000; 228               uint transferAmount = rewards[i] - tax; 229               taxes[poolId][i] += tax; 230               success = success && IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).transfer(receipt.owner, transferAmount); 231           } ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-factorydao/blob/db415804c06143d8af6880bc4cda7222e5463c0e/contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol#L224-L231  ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Allow the specification of an offset and length to the `withdraw()` function, so that withdrawals can be broken up into smaller batches if required
