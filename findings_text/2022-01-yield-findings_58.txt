# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Solidity contracts have contiguous 32 bytes (256 bits) slots used in storage. By arranging the variables, it is possible to minimize the number of slots used within a contract's storage and therefore reduce deployment costs.  ## Proof of Concept In `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol`, the order of variables is this way: ```     uint256 public cvx_reward_integral;     uint256 public cvx_reward_remaining;     mapping(address => uint256) public cvx_reward_integral_for;     mapping(address => uint256) public cvx_claimable_reward;      //constants/immutables     address public constant convexBooster = address(0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31);     address public constant crv = address(0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52);     address public constant cvx = address(0x4e3FBD56CD56c3e72c1403e103b45Db9da5B9D2B);     address public curveToken;     address public convexToken;     address public convexPool;     address public collateralVault;     uint256 public convexPoolId;      //rewards     RewardType[] public rewards;      //management     bool public isShutdown;     bool private _status;      bool private constant _NOT_ENTERED = false;     bool private constant _ENTERED = true; ``` `address` type variables are each of 20 bytes size (way less than 32 bytes). However, they here take up a whole 32 bytes slot (they are contiguous). As `bool` type variables are of size 1 byte, there's a slot here that can get saved by moving them closer to an address  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I suggest the following (see the @audit-info tags for more details about what moved and why): ```     uint256 public cvx_reward_integral;     uint256 public cvx_reward_remaining;     mapping(address => uint256) public cvx_reward_integral_for;     mapping(address => uint256) public cvx_claimable_reward;      //constants/immutables     uint256 public convexPoolId; //@audit-info this moved up to free collateralVault's slot.     address public constant convexBooster = address(0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31);     address public constant crv = address(0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52);     address public constant cvx = address(0x4e3FBD56CD56c3e72c1403e103b45Db9da5B9D2B);     address public curveToken;     address public convexToken;     address public convexPool;     address public collateralVault; //@audit-info this got freed from convexPoolId. Slot N is at 20/32 here      //management      bool public isShutdown; //@audit-info this moved up. Slot N is full at 21/32 here      bool private _status; //@audit-info this moved up. Slot N is full at 22/32 here      bool private constant _NOT_ENTERED = false; //@audit-info this moved up but doesn't take a slot as it's constant     bool private constant _ENTERED = true; //@audit-info this moved up but doesn't take a slot as it's constant       //rewards     RewardType[] public rewards; ```
