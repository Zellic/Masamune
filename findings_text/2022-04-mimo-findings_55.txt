But in the case of [GUniLPOracle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-mimo/blob/b18670f44d595483df2c0f76d1c57a7bfbfbc083/core/contracts/oracles/GUniLPOracle.sol#L51), there is a decimal subtraction that could underflow if any token in the pool has more than 18 decimals. this could cause an error when calculating price values.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Ensure that tokens have less than 18 decimals.
