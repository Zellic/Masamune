# Handle  Reigada   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In both airdrop contracts: AirdropDistribution and InvestorDistribution, once all the participants have claimed their tokens, some will remain in the contract due to some imprecision in the calculations. There is no function that allows to substract them which means that those tokens will remain stuck in the contracts forever.  I have made the test with just 5 participants: user2, user3, user4, user5 & user6.  uint256[5] airdropBalances =     [     4032000,     4032000,     4032000,     4032000,     4032000     ];  >>> 4032000 * 5 20160000  Initially 20160000 tokens were transferred to the contract  mockToken.transfer(airdropdist.address, 20160000000000000000000000)  After 260 weeks, these were the results:  ----------------> mockToken.balanceOf(airdropdist.address) -> 2842805668532461833600 <-----------------  mockToken.balanceOf(user2) -> 1209429431659888052289865 vesting.benTotal(user2.address) -> 2822002007206405455343415 mockToken.balanceOf(user3) -> 1209429431659888052289984 vesting.benTotal(user3.address) -> 2822002007206405455343296 mockToken.balanceOf(user4) -> 1209429431659888052289984 vesting.benTotal(user4.address) -> 2822002007206405455343296 mockToken.balanceOf(user5) -> 1209429431659888052289984 vesting.benTotal(user5.address) -> 2822002007206405455343296 mockToken.balanceOf(user6) -> 1209429431659888052289984 vesting.benTotal(user6.address) -> 2822002007206405455343296  As we can see above 2842 tokens remain in the contract and there is no way to retrieve them.  ## Tools Used Manual testing / brownie  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an onlyOwner function that allows to retrieve all the remaining tokens once all the participants of the airdrop have claimed the whole amount of their rewards.
