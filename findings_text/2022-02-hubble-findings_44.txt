It probably assumes that the answer for the underlying is in 8 decimals but then wants to reduce it for 6 decimals to match USDC.  However, arbitrary `underlying` tokens are used and the chainlink oracles can have different decimals.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps While most USD price feeds use 8 decimals, it's better to take the on-chain reported decimals into account by doing `AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).decimals()`, see [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/#getting-a-different-price-denomination). The price should then be scaled down to 6 decimals.
