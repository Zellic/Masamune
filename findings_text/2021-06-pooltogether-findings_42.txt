# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  YearnV2YieldSource initialize does a zero-address check for value address to detect if it has already been initialized. This is an unnecessary check because vault address default value is zero, it is not initialized/set anywhere else and the initializer modifier will prevent the calling of initialize() a second time. So vault is guaranteed to be zero in initialize().  The impact is gas wastage from an additional SLOAD of vault state variable and the require() check.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/yield-source/YearnV2YieldSource.sol#L25  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/yield-source/YearnV2YieldSource.sol#L73  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the zero-address check for vault.
