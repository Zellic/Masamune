Operators who withdraw HLG will be charged a 0.1% fee, the proceeds of which will be burned or returned to the Treasury.  The charge 0.1% fee is not implemented in the code.  there are two incentive for bounded operator to stay,  the first is the reward incentive, the second is to avoid penalty with unbonding.  Without chargin the unstaking fee, the second incentive is weak and the operator can unbound or bond whenver they want  ## Proof of Concept  https://docs.holograph.xyz/holograph-protocol/operator-network-specification#operator-job-selection  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  we recommend charge the 0.1% unstaking fee to make the code align with the busienss requirement in the doc.  ```solidity /**  * @dev get current bonded amount by operator  */ uint256 amount = _bondedAmounts[operator]; uint256 fee = chargedFee(amount); // here amount -= fee;   /**  * @dev unset operator bond amount before making a transfer  */ _bondedAmounts[operator] = 0; /**  * @dev remove all operator references  */ _popOperator(_bondedOperators[operator] - 1, _operatorPodIndex[operator]); /**  * @dev transfer tokens to recipient  */ require(_utilityToken().transfer(recipient, amount), "HOLOGRAPH: token transfer failed"); ```
