# Handle  rfa   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When you are reading a value from a storage and using a storage pointer instead of memory, you write directly to the storage instead of the memory.  In the https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L234 this line is reading membership[msg.sender] with a storage pointer,  this means any changes to the user variable, is updating directly to the membership[msg.sender],  therefore https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L294 this line update, makes it useless since the data already written to the membership[msg.sender]  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L234-L294   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L294 membership[msg.sender] = user;
