# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact cancelPromotion() and its modifier both call _getPromotion() to get the Promotion struct. We can save one such call by removing the modifier and do the check of the modifier at the beginning of the cancelPromotion() block to save storage reads.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L119  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - remove the modifier onlyPromotionCreator - do the require statement at the beginning of cancelPromotion()       function cancelPromotion(uint256 _promotionId, address _to)         external         override         returns (bool)     {         Promotion memory _promotion = _getPromotion(_promotionId);                // do here the modifiers check          require(             msg.sender == _promotion .creator,             "TwabRewards/only-promotion-creator"         );          _requirePromotionActive(_promotion);         require(_to != address(0), "TwabRewards/recipient-not-zero-address");          uint256 _remainingRewards = _getRemainingRewards(_promotion);          delete _promotions[_promotionId];         _promotion.token.safeTransfer(_to, _remainingRewards);          emit PromotionCancelled(_promotionId, _remainingRewards);          return true;     }
