The `auction.seller` account is updated to the new address, however, the protocol fails to update `buyPrice.seller`. As a result, the protocol is put in a deadlock situation where the new address cannot cancel the auction and withdraw their NFT without the compromised account first cancelling the buy price and vice-versa. This is only recoverable if the new account is migrated back to the compromised account and then `cancelBuyPrice()` is called before migrating back.  ## Proof of Concept  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider invalidating the buy offer before account migration.
