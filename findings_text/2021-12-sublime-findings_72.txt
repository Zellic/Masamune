# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas costs on linking/unlinking addresses  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Verification/Verification.sol#L10-L13  The activation timestamp can be restricted to a `uint64` variable so that it shares a slot with the `masterAddress`. This will save an SSTORE and a substantial amount of gas.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As above.
