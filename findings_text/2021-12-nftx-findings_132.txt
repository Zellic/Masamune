# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In some cases, having function arguments in calldata instead of memory is more optimal.  Consider the following generic example:  ``` contract C { function add(uint[] memory arr) external returns (uint sum) {   uint length = arr.length;   for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {       sum += arr[i];   } } } ``` In the above example, the dynamic array arr has the storage location memory. When the function gets called externally, the array values are kept in calldata and copied to memory during ABI decoding (using the opcode calldataload and mstore). And during the for loop, arr[i] accesses the value in memory using a mload. However, for the above example this is inefficient. Consider the following snippet instead:  ``` contract C { function add(uint[] calldata arr) external returns (uint sum) {   uint length = arr.length;   for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {       sum += arr[i];   } } } ```  In the above snippet, instead of going via memory, the value is directly read from calldata using calldataload. That is, there are no intermediate memory operations that carries this value.  Gas savings: In the former example, the ABI decoding begins with copying value from calldata to memory in a for loop. Each iteration would cost at least 60 gas. In the latter example, this can be completely avoided. This will also reduce the number of instructions and therefore reduces the deploy time cost of the contract.  In short, use calldata instead of memory if the function argument is only read.  Note that in older Solidity versions, changing some function arguments from memory to calldata may cause "unimplemented feature error". This can be avoided by using a newer (0.8.*) Solidity compiler.  Examples Note: The following pattern is prevalent in the codebase:  ``` function f(bytes memory data) external { (...) = abi.decode(data, (..., types, ...)); } ```  Here, changing to bytes calldata will decrease the gas. The total savings for this change across all such uses would be quite significant.   ## Proof Of Concept  Examples:  `https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXMarketplaceZap.sol#L297`  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change memory definition with calldata.
