Let's say `alice` does not hold any token of `tokenId`, and `bob` holds one token of `tokenId`. Then alice tries to send one token of `tokenId` to bob with `safeTranferFrom(alice, bob, tokenId, 1, "")`.  In this case, even though alice's balance (= 0) is lower than the amount (= 1) sent, the `safeTransferFrom` will not revert. Thus, violating the EIP-1155 standard. It can cause problems for other contracts using this token, since they assume the token was transferred if the `safeTransferFrom` does not revert. However, in the example above, no token was actually transferred.  ```solidity // https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-ens/blob/ff6e59b9415d0ead7daf31c2ed06e86d9061ae22/contracts/wrapper/ERC1155Fuse.sol#L274-L284 // wrapper/ERC1155Fuse.sol::_transfer // ERC1155Fuse::safeTransferFrom uses _transfer  274     function _transfer( 275         address from, 276         address to, 277         uint256 id, 278         uint256 amount, 279         bytes memory data 280     ) internal { 281         (address oldOwner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = getData(id); 282         if (oldOwner == to) { 283             return; 284         } ```  ## Tools Used  none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Revert even if the `to` address already owns the token.
