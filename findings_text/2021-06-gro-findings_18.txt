# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In several functions of BaseVaultAdaptor a value is stored in the variable amount at the end of the function. However this variable is never used afterwards so the storage is unnecessary and just uses gas.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/vaults/BaseVaultAdaptor.sol#L165     function withdraw(uint256 amount) external override {      ..         if (!_withdrawFromAdapter(amount, msg.sender)) {             amount = _withdraw(calculateShare(amount), msg.sender);      function withdraw(uint256 amount, address recipient) external override {     ...         if (!_withdrawFromAdapter(amount, recipient)) {             amount = _withdraw(calculateShare(amount), recipient);      function withdrawToAdapter(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {         amount = _withdraw(calculateShare(amount), address(this));     }      function withdrawByStrategyOrder( ..         if (!_withdrawFromAdapter(amount, recipient)) {             amount = _withdrawByStrategyOrder(calculateShare(amount), recipient, reversed);      function withdrawByStrategyIndex(    ...         if (!_withdrawFromAdapter(amount, recipient)) {             amount = _withdrawByStrategyIndex(calculateShare(amount), recipient, strategyIndex);   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace   amount = _withdraw***(...); with    _withdraw***(...);
