# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   Due to how `constant` variables are implemented, an expression assigned to a `constant` variable is recomputed each time that the variable is used, which wastes some gas.      If the variable was `immutable` instead: the calculation would only be done once at deploy time (in the constructor), and then the result would be saved and read directly at runtime rather than being recalculated.    See: [ethereum/solidity#9232]([https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232))      ## Proof of Concept   ```   Timeswap-V1-Convenience\contracts\libraries\DateTime.sol:31:    uint constant SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60; Timeswap-V1-Convenience\contracts\libraries\DateTime.sol:32:    uint constant SECONDS_PER_HOUR = 60 * 60; ```      ## Tools Used   VS Code      ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Change these expressions from `constant` to `immutable` and implement the calculation in the constructor
