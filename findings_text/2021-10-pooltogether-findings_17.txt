# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the contract PrizeSplit.sol, uint8 is used in a few places. This limits the addressable size of _prizeSplits.  In practice you would probably not split prizes in more than 256 ways, but checking for this is safer.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-strategy/PrizeSplit.sol#L86-L87  function setPrizeSplit(PrizeSplitConfig memory _prizeSplit, uint8 _prizeSplitIndex)  https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-strategy/PrizeSplit.sol#L130-L140  for (uint8 index = 0; index < prizeSplitsLength; index++) {  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the following  to function setPrizeSplits:    require(newPrizeSplitsLength <= type(uint8).max))  or replace uint8 with uint256 in PrizeSplit.sol
