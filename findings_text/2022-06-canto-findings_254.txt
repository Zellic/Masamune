Assuming `proposalId` is incremented linearly in conjunction with `proposalCount`, this implies only the most recent `proposalId` will pass the `require()` check above. All other proposals will not be able to have their states checked via this function.   ## Tools Used Manual Review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change above function to `proposalCount <= proposalId` (assuming `proposalId` is set linearly, which currently is not enforced by code).
