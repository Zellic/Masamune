# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `TracerPerpetualSwaps.settle` function updates the user's last index to `currentGlobalFundingIndex`, however a comment states:  > "// Note: global rates reference the last fully established rate (hence the -1), and not the current global rate. User rates reference the last saved user rate"  The code for the `else` branch also updates the last index to `currentGlobalFundingIndex - 1` instead of `currentGlobalFundingIndex`.  ```solidity if (accountBalance.position.base == 0) {     // set to the last fully established index     // @audit shouldn't this be global - 1 like below?     accountBalance.lastUpdatedIndex = currentGlobalFundingIndex;     accountBalance.lastUpdatedGasPrice = IOracle(gasPriceOracle).latestAnswer(); } ```   ## Impact It might be possible that first-time depositors skip having to pay the first funding rate period as the `accountLastUpdatedIndex + 1 < currentGlobalFundingIndex` check will still return `false` when the funding rates are updated the next time.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check if setting it to `currentGlobalFundingIndex` or to `currentGlobalFundingIndex - 1` is correct.
