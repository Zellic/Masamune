# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `GatewayVault._push()` function gets `redirects` from the `strategyParams`. If `redirects[i] = j`, vault index `i`'s deposits are redirected to vault index `j`.  Note that the deposits for vault index `i` are cleared, as they are redirected:  ```solidity for (uint256 j = 0; j < _vaultTokens.length; j++) {     uint256 vaultIndex = _subvaultNftsIndex[strategyParams.redirects[i]];     amountsByVault[vaultIndex][j] += amountsByVault[i][j];     amountsByVault[i][j] = 0; } ```  > The same is true for withdrawals in the `_pull` function. Users might not be able to withdraw this way.  If the `redirects` array is misconfigured, it's possible that all `amountsByVault` are set to zero. For example, if `0` redirects to `1` and `1` redirects to `0`. Or `0` redirects to itself, etc. There are many misconfigurations that can lead to not being able to deposit to the pool anymore.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `redirects[i] = j` matrix needs to be restricted. If `i` is redirected to `j`, `j` may not redirect itself. Check for this when setting the `redirects` array.
