The contract MUST allow ///  multiple operators per owner. /// @param _operator Address to add to the set of authorized operators /// @param _approved True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external; ``` Besides operators, there are also approved addresses for a token (for which `approve` is used). However, approved addresses can only transfer the token, see for instance the `safeTransferFrom` description: ```solidity /// @dev Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized ///  operator, or the approved address for this NFT. ``` `HolographERC721` does not distinguish between authorized operators and approved addresses when it comes to the `approve` function. Because `_isApproved(msg.sender, tokenId)` is used there, an approved address can approve another address, which is a violation of the EIP (only authorized operators should be able to do so).  ## Proof Of Concept Bob calls `approve` to approve Alice on token ID 42 (that is owned by Bob). One week later, Bob sees that a malicious address was approved for his token ID 42 (e.g., because Alice got phished) and stole his token. Bob wonders how this is possible, because Alice should not have the permission to approve other addresses. However, becaue `HolographERC721` did not follow EIP-721, it was possible.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Follow the EIP, i.e. do not allow approved addresses to approve other addresses.
