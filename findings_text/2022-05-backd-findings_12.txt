# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L103   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Staking is not stopped even when Gauge is killed. User will not be getting any reward for the staked asset.  ## Proof of Concept 1. Assume the AMMGauge is killed using kill function (AmmGauge.sol#L49). This sets killed as true  2. poolCheckpoint will not further increase ammStakedIntegral and would simply return false  ``` function poolCheckpoint() public virtual override returns (bool) {         if (killed) {             return false;         }   ...   } ```  3. User calls stakeFor function and is still able to stake amount.   4. The drawback will be no rewards as poolCheckpoint will only return false and will not update ammStakedIntegral  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add below check in stakeFor function, restricting deposit if Gauge is killed  ``` require(!killed, "Gauge killed"); ```
