# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `veCVXStrategy.manualRebalance` function computes two ratios `currentLockRatio` and `newLockRatio` and compares them.  However, these ratios compute different things and are not comparable: - `currentLockRatio = balanceInLock.mul(10**18).div(totalCVXBalance)` is a **percentage value** with 18 decimals (i.e. `1e18 = 100%`). Its max value can at most be `1e18`. - `newLockRatio = totalCVXBalance.mul(toLock).div(MAX_BPS)` is a **CVX token amount**. It's unbounded and just depends on the `totalCVXBalance` amount.  The comparison that follows does not make sense:  ```solidity if (newLockRatio <= currentLockRatio) {   // ... } ```  ## Impact The rebalancing is broken and does not correctly rebalance. It usually leads to locking nearly everything if `totalCVXBalance` is high.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Judging from the `cvxToLock = newLockRatio.sub(currentLockRatio)` it seems the desired computation is that the "ratios" should actually be in CVX amounts and not in percentages. Therefore, `currentLockRatio` should just be `balanceInLock`. (The variables should be renamed as they aren't really ratios but absolute CVX balance amounts.)
