# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  L102: `_mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);` should be shifted after the if / else block to L110 because of further checks done in L106, and L108-L109.  This would help save gas should the checks mentioned fail.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx if (msg.sender == migrator) {   liquidity = IMigrator(migrator).desiredLiquidity();   require(liquidity != 0 && liquidity != type(uint256).max, "BAD_DESIRED_LIQUIDITY"); } else {   require(migrator == address(0), "ONLY_MIGRATOR");   liquidity = computed - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY; } _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); ```
