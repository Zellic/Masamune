This can be used to create a second account, transfer the accounts to them and initiate withdrawals at a different time frame such that one of the accounts is always in a valid withdrawal window, no matter what time it is. If the token owner now wants to withdraw they just transfer the funds to the account that is currently in a valid withdrawal window.  Also, note that each account can withdraw the specified `amount`. Creating several accounts and circling & initiating withdrawals with all of them allows withdrawing larger amounts **even at the same block** as they are purchased in the future.  I consider this high severity because it breaks core functionality of the Collateral token.  #### POC For example, assume the `_delayedWithdrawalExpiry = 20` blocks. Account A owns 1000 collateral tokens, they create a second account B. - At `block=0`, A calls `initiateWithdrawal(1000)`. They send their balance to account B. - At `block=10`, B calls `initiateWithdrawal(1000)`. They send their balance to account A. - They repeat these steps, alternating the withdrawal initiation every 10 blocks. - One of the accounts is always in a valid withdrawal window (`initiationBlock < block && block <= initiationBlock + 20`). They can withdraw their funds at any time.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps If there's a withdrawal request for the token owner (`_accountToWithdrawalRequest[owner].blockNumber > 0`), disable their transfers for the time.  ```solidity // pseudo-code not tested beforeTransfer(from, to, amount) {   super();   uint256 withdrawalStart =  _accountToWithdrawalRequest[from].blockNumber;   if(withdrawalStart > 0 && withdrawalStart + _delayedWithdrawalExpiry < block.number) {     revert(); // still in withdrawal window   } } ```
