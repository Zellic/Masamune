# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  During the code review, It has been seen that malt price return value has not been checked on the function.  If oracle is returned price as a 0, fullReturn will be zero on the earlyExitReturn function.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/AuctionEscapeHatch.sol#L124" 2. The return value maltMarketPrice() function has not been checked.  ## Tools Used  Code Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider to add return value check. The maltPrice should be more than zero for the calculation.  """ require(dexHandler.maltMarketPrice()>0, "Price should be more than zero"); """
