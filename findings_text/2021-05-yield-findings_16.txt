# Handle  0xsomeone   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  It is possible to duplicate currently held `ink` or `art` within a Cauldron, thereby breaking the contract's accounting system minting units out of thin air.  ## Proof of Concept  The `stir` function of the `Cauldron`, which can be invoked via a `Ladle` operation, caches balances in memory before decrementing and incrementing. As a result, if a transfer to self is performed, the assignment `balances[to] = balancesTo` will contain the added-to balance instead of the neutral balance.  This allows one to duplicate any number of `ink` or `art` units at will, thereby severely affecting the protocol's integrity. A similar attack was exploited in the third bZx hack resulting in a roughly 8 million loss.
