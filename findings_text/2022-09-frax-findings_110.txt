Yields are released over the next rewards cycle. As a result, malicious users can steal yields from innocent users by picking special timing to `deposit()` and `redeem()`.   ## Proof of Concept  In `syncRewards()`, the current asset balance is break into 2 parts: `storedTotalAssets` and `lastRewardAmount/nextRewards`. The `lastRewardAmount` is the surplus balance of the asset, or the most recent yields. ```solidity // lib/ERC4626/src/xERC4626.sol     function syncRewards() public virtual {         // ...          uint256 nextRewards = asset.balanceOf(address(this)) - storedTotalAssets_ - lastRewardAmount_;          storedTotalAssets = storedTotalAssets_ + lastRewardAmount_;          uint32 end = ((timestamp + rewardsCycleLength) / rewardsCycleLength) * rewardsCycleLength;          lastRewardAmount = nextRewards.safeCastTo192();         // ...                 rewardsCycleEnd = end;     } ```  And in the next rewards cycle, `lastRewardAmount` will be linearly added to `storedTotalAssets`, their sum is the return value of `totalAssets()`:  ```solidity     function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {         // ...          if (block.timestamp >= rewardsCycleEnd_) {             // no rewards or rewards fully unlocked             // entire reward amount is available             return storedTotalAssets_ + lastRewardAmount_;         }          // rewards not fully unlocked         // add unlocked rewards to stored total         uint256 unlockedRewards = (lastRewardAmount_ * (block.timestamp - lastSync_)) / (rewardsCycleEnd_ - lastSync_);         return storedTotalAssets_ + unlockedRewards;     } ```  `totalAssets()` will be referred when `deposit()` and `redeem()`. ```solidity // lib/solmate/src/mixins/ERC4626.sol      function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256 shares) {         require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");         // ...         _mint(receiver, shares);         // ...     }      function redeem() public virtual returns (uint256 assets) {         // ...         require((assets = previewRedeem(shares)) != 0, "ZERO_ASSETS");          beforeWithdraw(assets, shares);          _burn(owner, shares);          // ...          asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);     }      function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {         return convertToShares(assets);     }      function previewRedeem(uint256 shares) public view virtual returns (uint256) {         return convertToAssets(shares);     }      function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {         uint256 supply = totalSupply;           return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets());     }      function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view virtual returns (uint256) {         uint256 supply = totalSupply;           return supply == 0 ? shares : shares.mulDivDown(totalAssets(), supply);     } ```  Based on the above rules, there are 2 potential abuse cases: 1. If withdraw just after the `rewardsCycleEnd` timestamp, a user can not get the yields from last rewards cycle. Since the `totalAssets()` only contain `storedTotalAssets` but not the yields part. It takes 1 rewards cycle to linearly add to the `storedTotalAssets`.   Assume per 10,000 asset staking generate yields of 70 for 7 days, and the reward cycle is 1 day. A malicious user Alice can do the following: - watch the mempool for  `withdraw(10,000)` from account Bob, front run it with `syncRewards()`, so that the most recent yields of amount 70 from Bob will stay in the vault.  - Alice will also deposit a 10,000 to take as much shares as possible.  - after 1 rewards cycle of 1 day, `redeem()` to take the yields of 70.   Effectively steal the yields from Bob. The profit for Alice is not 70, because after 1 day, her own deposit also generates some yield, in this example this portion is 1. At the end, Alice steal yield of amount 60.   2. When the Multisig Treasury transfers new yields into the vault, the new yields will accumulate until `syncRewards()` is called. It is possible that yields from multiple rewards cycles accumulates, and being released in the next cycle.  Knowing that the yields has been accumulated for 3 rewards cycles, a malicious user can `deposit()` and call `syncRewards()` to trigger the release of the rewards. `redeem()` after 1 cycle.  Here the malicious user gets yields of 3 cycles, lose 1 in the waiting cycle. The net profit is 2 cycle yields, and the gained yields should belong to the other users in the vault.    ## Tools Used Manual analysis.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   - for the `lastRewardAmount` not released, allow the users to redeem as it is linearly released later. - for the accumulated yields, only allow users to redeem the yields received after 1 rewards cycle after the deposit.
