# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/adapters/YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#L23-L27  ```solidity=23 /// @dev The vault that the adapter is wrapping.     IVault public vault;      /// @dev The address which has admin control over this contract.     address public admin; ```  `vault` and `admin` will never change, use immutable variable instead of storage variable can save gas.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/146febcb61ae7fe20b0920849c4f4bbe111c6ba7/contracts/v3/alchemix/Transmuter.sol#L55-L56  ```solidity address public AlToken; address public Token; ```  `AlToken` and `Token` can also be changed to `immutable`.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/Alchemist.sol#L114-L122  ```solidity=114 /// @dev The token that this contract is using as the parent asset. IMintableERC20 public token;  /// @dev The token that this contract is using as the child asset. IMintableERC20 public xtoken; ```  `token` and `xtoken` can also be changed to `immutable`.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity /// @dev The vault that the adapter is wrapping. IVault public immutable vault;  /// @dev The address which has admin control over this contract. address public immutable admin;  constructor(IVault _vault, address _admin) public {     vault = _vault;     admin = _admin;     address _token = _vault.getToken();     IDetailedERC20(_token).safeApprove(address(_vault), uint256(-1)); } ```
