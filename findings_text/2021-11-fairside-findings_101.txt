# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `updateVestedTokens()` function is intended to be called by the `FSD.sol` contract when updating a user's vested token amount. A check is performed to ensure that `_user == beneficiary`, however, as `_user` is a user controlled argument, it is possible to spoof calls to `updateVestedTokens()` such that anyone can arbitrarily add any amount to the vested contract. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the call originated from a trusted/whitelisted source.  There are two main reasons as to why the beneficiary or an attacker would want to call this function: - To increase the vested amount such that `calculateVestingClaim()` allows them to withdraw their entire vested amount without waiting the entire duration. - An attacker wishes to block withdrawals from other vested contracts by preventing successful calls to `claimVestedTokens()` by the beneficiary account. This can be done by increasing the vested amount such that `safeTransfer()` calls fail due to insufficient token balance within the contract.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/token/FSDVesting.sol#L147-L161 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/token/FSDVesting.sol#L100-L115 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/token/FSDVesting.sol#L125 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/token/FSDVesting.sol#L134  ## Tools Used  Manual code review. Discussions with dev.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure that the `updateVestedTokens()` function is only callable from the `FSD.sol` contract. This can be done by implementing an `onlyFSD` role.
