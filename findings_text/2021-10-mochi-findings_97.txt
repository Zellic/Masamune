# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/feePool/ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#L28-L42  ```solidity=28 function claimRewardAsMochi() external {     IUSDM usdm = engine.usdm();     address[] memory path = new address[](2);     path[0] = address(usdm);     path[1] = uniswapRouter.WETH();     path[2] = address(engine.mochi());     usdm.approve(address(uniswapRouter), reward[msg.sender]);     // we are going to ingore the slippages here     uniswapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(         reward[msg.sender],         1,         path,         address(this),         type(uint256).max     ); ```  In `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi()`, `path` is defined as an array of length 2 while it should be length 3.  As a result, at L33, an out-of-bound exception will be thrown and revert the transaction.  ### Impact  `claimRewardAsMochi()` will not work as expected so that all the referral fees cannot be claimed but stuck in the contract.
