# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The state variables corresponding to setGenesisFactors() parameters _coolOff, _daysToEarn, _majorityFactor, _daoClaim and_daoFee are declared to be uint256 but are set using these parameters that are uint32. While it’s unlikely that these will need values > uint32, this leads to wastage of storage slots and gas.   ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L128  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L21-L24  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L19   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The state variables can be declared uint32 to fit all five of them in a single slot and this will lead to efficient SSTOREs because they are set together. If values > uint32 are relevant, then the parameter types of setter setGenesisFactors() have to be changed.
