# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are variables that do not change so they can be marked as immutable to greatly improve the gast costs. Examples of such variables are: Limbo.sol ```solidity   FlanLike Flan; ``` TokenProxyLike.sol ```solidity   address internal baseToken; ``` ProposalFactory.sol ```solidity   string public description;   LimboDAOLike DAO; ``` Please review all the state variables and apply immutable where possible.
