# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The use of _msgSender() when there is no implementation of a meta transaction mechanism that uses it, such as EIP-2771, very slightly increases gas consumption.   ## Proof of Concept  _msgSender() is utilized three times where msg.sender could have been used in the following function.
