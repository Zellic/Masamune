Similar to function `publishProject`, add a new field into the [ProjectDetails](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/interfaces/ICommunity.sol#L19-L32) struct called `escrowNonce`.  2. Modify function `escrow` to check this nonce and update it after the debt has been reduced.
