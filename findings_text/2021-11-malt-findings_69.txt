# Handle  BouSalman   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability description  The event **SetAnnualYield** on Contract **StabilizerNode** is defined but never emitted inside the Contract.  ## Impact Unused events in the codebase can be confusing, each declared event should have a corresponding emit statement.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/StabilizerNode.sol#L73  ## Tools Used manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps it's better to remove unused events from the code to improve coding quality, Also monitoring will be effected since no emit statements is there.
