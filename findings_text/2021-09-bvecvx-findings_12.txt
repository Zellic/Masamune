# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function `reinvest` in the veCVXStrategy always returns 0 as the return variable `reinvested` is never updated.  The function is `onlyGovernance` and the return value probably does not matter if the caller is a multi-sig. However, if a protocol is set as `onlyGovernance` the faulty return value would have to be ignored by the caller to not transition into an incorrect state.  ## Proof of Concept The variable `reinvested` is declared as return variable (line 400) but not updated to reflect the actual amount reinvested which is saved in variable `toDeposit`.  Therefore always the default value is returned (0).
