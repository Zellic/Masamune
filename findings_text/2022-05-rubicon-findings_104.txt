# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconRouter.sol#L229:#L244   # Vulnerability details  When swapping amongst multiple pairs in RubiconRouter's `_swap`, the fee is wrongly accounted for.  ## Impact Not all of the user's funds would be forwarded to RubinconMarket, therefore the user would lose funds.  ## Proof of Concept The `_swap` function is calculating the pay amount to send to RubiconMarket.sellAllAmount [to be](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconRouter.sol#L232): ``` currentAmount.sub(currentAmount.mul(expectedMarketFeeBPS).div(10000) ``` But this would lead to not all of the funds being pulled by RubiconMarket. I mathematically show this in [this image](https://i.ibb.co/J5678C3/c4amountlost.jpg). The correct parameter that needs to be sent to sellAllAmount is: ``` currentAmount.sub(currentAmount.mul(expectedMarketFeeBPS).div(10000+expectedMarketFeeBPS) ``` I mathematically prove this in [this image](https://i.ibb.co/xHzYfzF/c4newparam.jpg).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the parameter to the abovementioned one.
