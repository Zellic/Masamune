# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Being instantiated with wrong configuration the contract will be inoperable.  If a misconfiguration is noticed too late the various types of malfunctions become possible.  ## Proof of Concept  RocketJoeStaking.initialize doesn't check input parameters, which are immutable due to initializer pattern:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeStaking.sol#L72-75   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider checking joe, rJoe addresses and lastRewardTimestamp to be non-zero and also checking rJoePerSec to be within pre specified bounds
