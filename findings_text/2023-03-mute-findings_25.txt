# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/bonds/MuteBond.sol#L156-L158   # Vulnerability details  The `MuteBond.deposit()` function allows users to specify the amount of value they want to purchase bonds for or to set `max_buy` to true. If `max_buy` is set to true the amount specified in the `value` parameter is ignored and instead the maximum amount available for purchase in the current epoch is used.  This can lead to a scenario where a user intends to purchase the remaining amount of current epoch, but till the tx is included in the blockchain a new epoch starts (either by an innocent user or by an attacker) and the user ends up buying the entire amount of the next epoch.  ## Impact A. The user ends up buying a much higher amount than intended B. The user ends up buying it for a lower price than intended (i.e. less payout for the buyer)  ## Proof of Concept The PoC below shows how `maxPurchaseAmount()` increases when a new era starts.   File: `test/bonds.ts` ```solidity   it('Max buy PoC', async function () {      // buy 99% of amount available for purchase in current epoch     let maxValue = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();     let depositValue = maxValue.mul(99).div(100);     await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(depositValue, buyer1.address, false);          // The amount available when the victim sends out the tx     var expectedDeposit = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()      await bondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit('0', buyer1.address, true);      // The amount available when the victims's tx is included in the blockchain     var actualDeposit = await bondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();          // expected deposit = 1 wad     // actual deposit = 100 wad     console.log({expectedDeposit, actualDeposit});   }) ```  [The following snippet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-mute/blob/4d8b13add2907b17ac14627cfa04e0c3cc9a2bed/contracts/bonds/MuteBond.sol#L156-L159) shows that when a user sets `max_buy` to true the value used is the `maxPurchaseAmount()` ```solidity         if(max_buy == true){           value = maxPurchaseAmount();           payout = maxDeposit();         } else { ```    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Require the user to specify the epoch number when doing a 'max buy', and revert if it doesn't match the current epoch (it might be a good idea to refactor the code to 2 external functions for normal buy and max buy, where they both share an internal function to make the actual deposit)   Side note: this is similar to another bug I've reported regarding getting a lower price than expected, however the root cause, impact, and mitigation are different and therefore I've reported this separately.
