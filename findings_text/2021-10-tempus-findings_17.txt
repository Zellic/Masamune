# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  ## Proof of Concept  As the `TempusAmm` only ever registers with the Balancer Vault with the two token specialization the `GeneralPool` interface will never be used as the Vault will call the `MinimalSwapInfoPool` hooks instead.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/amm/TempusAMM.sol#L107-L110  See here in the Balancer Vault code:  https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/62c5cba7cae1d481f913c90fe0d9d94e101570c5/pkg/vault/contracts/Swaps.sol#L287-L292  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the inheritance from `BaseGeneralPool` and remove the functions highlighted in the link below. This will help reduce bytecode from the AMM factory and reduce deployment costs.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/amm/TempusAMM.sol#L283-L309
