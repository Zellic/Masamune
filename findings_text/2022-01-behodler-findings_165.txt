# Handle  kirk-baird   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The proposal contract `WithdrawERC20Proposal` allows a the DAO to withdraw ERC20 tokens to a destination the the function [withdrawERC20()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/Proposals/WithdrawERC20Proposal.sol#L35).  However, this function is not implemented in [Limbo.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/Limbo.sol) and thus the execution can never succeed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider implementing this functionality in `Limbo.sol` or deleting the proposal.
