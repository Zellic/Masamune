Therefore, one user can easily multiply his voting power, which makes the toking useless for voting / governance decisions.  ## Proof Of Concept Bob owns the token with ID 1 with a current balance of 1000. He also owns tokens 2, 3, 4, 5. Therefore, he calls `delegate(1, 2)`, `delegate(1, 3)`, `delegate(1, 4)`, `delegate(1, 5)`. Now, if there is a governance decision and `getVotes` is called, Bobs balance of 1000 is included in token 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, he quadrupled the voting power of token 1.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the entry in `delegatedTokenIds` of the old delegatee or simply call `removeDelegation` first.
