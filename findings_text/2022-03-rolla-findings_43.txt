See the implementation of [openzeppelin `EIP712Upgradeable` initializer function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v4.5.1/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712Upgradeable.sol#L48-L57).  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-rolla/blob/efe4a3c1af8d77c5dfb5ba110c3507e67a061bdd/quant-protocol/contracts/utils/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol#L102-L114  ```solidity     /// @notice initialize method for EIP712Upgradeable     /// @dev called once after initial deployment and every upgrade.     /// @param _name the user readable name of the signing domain for EIP712     /// @param _version the current major version of the signing domain for EIP712     function initializeEIP712(string memory _name, string memory _version)         public         initializer     {         name = _name;         version = _version;          __EIP712_init(_name, _version);     } ```  Otherwise, when the concrete contract's initializer function (with a `initializer` modifier) is calling EIP712MetaTransaction's initializer function, it will be mistok as reentered and so that it will be reverted (unless in the context of a constructor, e.g. Using @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades `deployProxy()` to initialize).  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v4.5.1/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L50-L53  ```solidity     /**      * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.      */     modifier initializer() {         // If the contract is initializing we ignore whether _initialized is set in order to support multiple         // inheritance patterns, but we only do this in the context of a constructor, because in other contexts the         // contract may have been reentered.         require(_initializing ? _isConstructor() : !_initialized, "Initializable: contract is already initialized");          bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;         if (isTopLevelCall) {             _initializing = true;             _initialized = true;         }          _;          if (isTopLevelCall) {             _initializing = false;         }     } ```  See also: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/releases/tag/v4.4.1   2. `initializer` can only be called once, it can not be "called once after every upgrade".  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-rolla/blob/efe4a3c1af8d77c5dfb5ba110c3507e67a061bdd/quant-protocol/contracts/utils/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol#L102-L114  ```solidity     /// @notice initialize method for EIP712Upgradeable     /// @dev called once after initial deployment and every upgrade.     /// @param _name the user readable name of the signing domain for EIP712     /// @param _version the current major version of the signing domain for EIP712     function initializeEIP712(string memory _name, string memory _version)         public         initializer     {         name = _name;         version = _version;          __EIP712_init(_name, _version);     } ```   3. A utils contract that is not expected to be deployed as a standalone contract should be declared as `abstract`. It's `initializer` function should be `internal`.
