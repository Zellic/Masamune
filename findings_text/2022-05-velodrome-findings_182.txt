It will restrict any other tokens to be used as `rewards` in [Bribe.sol#notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L41)  ## Proof of Concept  A custom malicious contract can be created that can make multiple calls to `notifyRewardAmount()` sending very small amounts of different tokens to populate the array `rewards` and fulfill the total of `MAX_REWARD_TOKENS` . This will restrict any other person from adding to `rewards` array.   ## Tools Used  - Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps
