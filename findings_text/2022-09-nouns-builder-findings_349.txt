It means that the new bidder will get the Bid, even though the previous bidder has the same bid and was earlier. The `minBid` can be the same as the `highesBid` when `highestBid * minBidIncrement` is less than 100. So either the `highestBid` or `minBinIncrement` is too small, a bidder can overbid the precious one with the same amount of value.  The first bid should be higher or equal to the `reservePrice`. However, there is no safe guard against setting small `reservePrice` and `minBidIncrement`.  For example, let's say the `settings.minBidIncrement` is set to zero. Alice called `createBid` with 1 ether and is the current highestBidder with the `highestBid` of 1 ether. Bob calls `createBid` with 1 ether. The `minBid` in the line 119 will be 1ether as `minBidIncrement` is set to zero. In the line 123 the `msg.value` is 1 ether is the same as `minBid` therefore it will not revert. And now Bob is the `highestBidder` even though he bid the same value after Alice.  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Revert if the `msg.value` is the same as the `minBid`: ```solidity // Auction.sol  // createBid 117             unchecked { 118                 // Compute the minimum bid 119                 minBid = highestBid + ((highestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100); 120             } 121 122             // Ensure the incoming bid meets the minimum -   if (msg.value < minBid) revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET(); +  if (msg.value <= minBid) revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET(); ```  <!-- zzzitron M00 -->
