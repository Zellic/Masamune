# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Missing emits for declared events indicate potentially missing logic, redundant declarations or reduced off-chain monitoring capabilities.  Scenario: For example, the event LogFlashSwitchUpdated is missing an emit in Controller. Based on the name, this is presumably related to flash loans being enabled/disabled which could have significant security implications. Or the (misspelled) LogHealhCheckUpdate which is presumably related to a health check logic that is missing in LifeGuard.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L83  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L48  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/vaults/BaseVaultAdaptor.sol#L61  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/vaults/BaseVaultAdaptor.sol#L62  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Evaluate if logic is missing and add logic+emit or remove event.
