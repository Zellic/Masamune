# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Higher gas costs on transfers of tokens from user to TempusPool  ## Proof of Concept  Following the flow of tokens from the user to their the `TempusPool contract`:  1. User calls `TempusController.depositBacking`, `TempusController` transfers user's tokens to itself and approves relevant `TempusPool`  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/TempusController.sol#L412-L414  2. `TempusController` calls `TempusPool.deposit` which in turn transfers tokens from the `TempusController` and then invests them.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/TempusPool.sol#L178  This first transfer is then superfluous as the `TempusPool` trusts the `TempusController` (it's the only contract which may call `deposit`). We're then incurring the costs of 1 `transfer` and 1 `approve` unnecessarily.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As `TempusPool` trusts `TempusController`, `TempusController` can transfer the tokens directly to `TempusPool` and just tell it how much has been deposited.  L412-L414 of `TempusController.sol` would then be replaced with: ``` // Deposit to directly to targetPool uint transferredYBT = yieldBearingToken.untrustedTransferFrom(msg.sender, targetPool, yieldTokenAmount); ```
