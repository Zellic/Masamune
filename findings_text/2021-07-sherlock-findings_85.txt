This can save gas if both such elements are read or written at the same time (please use at least 0.8.2, since it has some improvements centred around optimizing packed Structs).  In the previous layout:  1.  `govMain` would have a slot of its own. 2.  `unstakeCooldown` and `unstakeWindow` would be packed together in a     single slot. 3.  `watsonsSherxWeight` and `watsonsSherxLastAccrued` would be packed     together in a single slot.  Note that gas savings are mainly relevant in the following cases:  1.  Compiler can optimize certain reads and writes to the same slot. 2.  Berlin EIP-2929 based gas accounting, i.e., if the same tx leaves     one of the slot warm. 3.  Berlin EIP-2930 for access lists. Instead of having to making three     different slots warm (in the original code), one only has to make     two slots warm, if necessary.  If none of these applies for your case, this suggestion may be ignored.  ## Packing for PoolStorage  ``` diff modified   contracts/storage/PoolStorage.sol @@ -15,20 +15,35 @@ library PoolStorage {     struct Base {      address govPool; +    // The last block the total amount of rewards were accrued. +    // Accrueing SherX increases the `unallocatedSherX` variable +    uint40 sherXLastAccrued; +    // Protocol debt can only be settled at once for all the protocols at the same time +    // This variable is the block number the last time all the protocols debt was settled +    uint40 totalPremiumLastPaid; + +    // How much sherX is distributed to stakers of this token +    // The max value is uint16(-1), which means 100% of the total SherX minted is allocated to this pool +    uint16 sherXWeight;      //      // Staking      //      // Indicates if stakers can stake funds in the pool      bool stakes; -    // Address of the lockToken.

Taking a quick look at the code, this change should reduce gas. (Might require 0.8.2, though; there was an improvement in the optimizer that would apply to packed structs in storage.)
