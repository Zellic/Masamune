# Handle  csanuragjain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact User funds can be lost if Admin sets startTimes[i] to 0  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to contract https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/farming/FarmingPools.sol  2. Check the initDistributions function  ``` function initDistributions(address[] memory stakeTokens, uint64[] memory startTimes, uint64[] memory durations) external onlyAdmin {         for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeTokens.length; i++) {             require(distributions[stakeTokens[i]].starttime == 0, 'Init once');             distributions[stakeTokens[i]] = Distribution(durations[i], startTimes[i], 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);         }     } ```  3. Assume Admin calls this for token X with startTimes[i] as 0. This creates a new distribution with start time as 0 for token X  4. User Y stakes amount 500 for this token X  5. Admin calls initDistributions again with token X and startTimes[i] as 1000. This overwrites and reinitializes distributions[X] which means totalStaked becomes 0 and contract has lost all track of user funds now  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check to see startTimes[i]!=0 in initDistributions function
