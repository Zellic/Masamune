Thus, it might cause integration problems in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.   ## Proof of Concept  All official EIP-4626 requirements can be found on it's [official page](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods). Non-compliant functions are listed below along with the reason they are not compliant:  The following functions are missing but should be present: 1. mint(uint256, address) returns (uint256) 2. redeem(uint256, address, address) returns (uint256)  The following functions are non-compliant because they don't account for withdraw and deposit locking: 1. maxDeposit 2. maxMint 3. maxWithdraw 4. maxRedeem  All of the above functions should return 0 when their respective functions are disabled (i.e. maxDeposit should return 0 when deposits are disabled)  previewDeposit is not compliant because it must account for fees which it does not  totalAssets is not compliant because it does not always return the underlying managed by the vault because it fails to include the assets paid out during a depeg or the end of the epoch.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  All functions listed above should be modified to meet the specifications of EIP-4626
