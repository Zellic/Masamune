# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact ETHER_ASSETID is a bit missleading name, I think a better name would be NATIVE_ASSETID:    address constant ETHER_ASSETID = address(0);  Misleading comment (should be 'for fulfillment'):   // The structure of the signed data for cancellations   struct SignedFulfillData {  MIN_TIMEOUT could be expressed in days:  uint256 public constant MIN_TIMEOUT = 1 days; // 24 hours
