# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  SafeMath library functions are not always used in arithmetic operations in the contracts, which could potentially cause integer underflow/overflows. Although in the reference lines of code, there are upper limits on the variables to ensure an integer underflow/overflow could not happen, using SafeMath is always a best practice, which prevents underflow/overflows completely (even if there were no assumptions on the variables) and increases code consistency as well.   ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following contracts.  ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L795  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L821  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/AuctionBurnReserveSkew.sol#L64  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/AuctionEscapeHatch.sol#L76  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/AuctionEscapeHatch.sol#L188  ```  2. SafeMath functions are not used in the every functionality.   ## Tools Used  Code Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using the SafeMath library functions in the referenced lines of code.
