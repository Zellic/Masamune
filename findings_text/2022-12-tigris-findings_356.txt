However the function doesn't actually safe transfer (doesn't )  ## Impact Users might use this function, expecting it to verify that the receiver is an `ERC721Receiver`, but will get their funds stuck in a contract that doesn't support ERC721.  ## Proof of Concept I've added the following tests to the `GovNFT` tests. 1st test will succeed (tx will revert) since `safeTransferFrom()` does actually use safe transfer. 2nd will fail (tx won't revert), since `safeTransferMany()` doesn't actually use a safe transfer.  ```diff diff --git a/test/05.GovNFT.js b/test/05.GovNFT.js index 711a649..d927320 100644 --- a/test/05.GovNFT.js +++ b/test/05.GovNFT.js @@ -98,6 +98,14 @@ describe("govnft", function () {        expect(await govnft.pending(owner.getAddress(), StableToken.address)).to.equal(1500);        expect(await govnft.pending(user.getAddress(), StableToken.address)).to.equal(500);      }); + +    it("Safe transfer to non ERC721Receiver", async function () { +       +      expect(govnft.connect(owner)['safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)'](owner.address,StableToken.address, 2)).to.be.revertedWith("ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"); +    }); +    it("Safe transfer many  to non ERC721Receiver", async function () { +      await expect(govnft.connect(owner).safeTransferMany(StableToken.address, [2])).to.be.revertedWith("ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"); +    });      it("Transferring an NFT with pending delisted rewards should not affect pending rewards", async function () {        await govnft.connect(owner).safeTransferMany(user.getAddress(), [2,3]);        expect(await govnft.balanceOf(owner.getAddress())).to.equal(0);  ```  Output (I've shortened the output. following test will also fail, since the successful transfer will affect them):  ```       ✔ Safe transfer to contract       1) Safe transfer many to contract     11 passing (3s)   1 failing    1) govnft        Reward system related functions          Safe transfer many to contract:        AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted       + expected - actual        -Transaction NOT reverted.       +Transaction reverted. ```   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Call `_safeTransfer()` instead of `_transfer()`.
