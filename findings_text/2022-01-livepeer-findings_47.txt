# Handle  jayjonah8   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In files like L1LPTDataCache.sol,  floating pragmas are used.  Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.  ## Proof of Concept https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103  ## Tools Used Manual code review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Lock the pragma version:  delete pragma solidity 0.8.0 in favor of pragma solidity 0.8.0
