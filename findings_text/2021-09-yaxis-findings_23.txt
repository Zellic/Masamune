# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There's no safety check in controller's `addStrategy`. When the same strategy is added to a vault twice, the protocol breakdowns in several ways.   1. Removing that strategy would always raise errors. 2. `_vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy]` would not track strategy's balance correctly; `getBestStrategyWithdraw` would have a wrong answer and makes withdrawing from the strategy to raise error in certain scenarios.  I consider this a low-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept This is the web3.py script: ```python controller.functions.addStrategy(vault.address, strategy.address, cap, 0).transact() controller.functions.addStrategy(vault.address, strategy.address, cap, 0).transact()  # would not be able to removestrategy controller.functions.removeStrategy(vault.address, strategy.address, 0).transact() ```  ## Tools Used Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The controller should raise an error if the strategy has been added to the protocol(any vault). As adding the same strategy to two different vaults would have worse results, the controller can maintain a map to record each strategy's status.
