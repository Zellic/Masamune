# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/InteractionLogic.sol#L49   # Vulnerability details  When someone tries to follow a profile, it checks if the handle exists, and if it doesn't, it reverts because the profile is deleted. The problem is that there might be a new profile with the same handle as the deleted one, allowing following deleted profiles.   ## Proof of Concept Alice creates a profile with the handle "alice." The profile id is 1. she deleted the profile. she opens a new profile with the handle "alice". The new profile id is 2. bob tries to follow the deleted profile (id is 1). the check ``` if (_profileIdByHandleHash[keccak256(bytes(handle))] == 0)  revert Errors.TokenDoesNotExist(); ``` doesn't revert because there exists a profile with the handle "alice". Therefore bob followed a deleted profile when he meant to follow the new profile.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  change to: ``` if (_profileIdByHandleHash[keccak256(bytes(handle))] != profileIds[i])  revert Errors.TokenDoesNotExist(); ```
