Internally this is accomplished by having a temporary variable `errorBuffer`, accumulating issues found, and only reverting once all the items are processed in case there was a problem found. This code is optimistic for valid inputs.  Note: there is a similar issue in `_aggregateValidFulfillmentConsiderationItems()` , which is reported separately.  The problem lies in how this `errorBuffer` is updated: ```solidity                 // Update error buffer (1 = zero amount, 2 = overflow).                 errorBuffer := or(                   errorBuffer,                   or(                     shl(1, lt(newAmount, amount)),                     iszero(mload(amountPtr))                   )                 ) ```  The final error handling code: ```solidity             // Determine if an error code is contained in the error buffer.             switch errorBuffer             case 1 {                 // Store the MissingItemAmount error signature.                 mstore(0, MissingItemAmount_error_signature)                  // Return, supplying MissingItemAmount signature.                 revert(0, MissingItemAmount_error_len)             }             case 2 {                 // If the sum overflowed, panic.                 throwOverflow()             } ```  While the expected value is `0` (success),  `1` or `2` (failure), it is possible to set it to `3`, which is unhandled and considered as a "success". This can be easily accomplished by having both an overflowing item and a zero item in the order list.  This validation error could lead to fulfilling an order with a consideration (potentially ~0) lower than expected.  ## Proof of Concept  Craft an offer containing two errors (e.g. with  zero amount and overflow). Call `matchOrders()`. Via calls to `_matchAdvancedOrders()`, `_fulfillAdvancedOrders()`, `_applyFulfillment()`, `_aggregateValidFulfillmentOfferItems()` will be called. The `errorBuffer` will get a value of 3  (the `or` of 1 and 2). As the value of 3 is not detected, no error will be thrown and the order will be executed, including the mal formed values.  ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Change the check on [FulfillmentApplier.sol#L465](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/main/contracts/lib/FulfillmentApplier.sol#L465)  to consider `case 3`. 2. Potential option: Introduce an early abort in case `errorBuffer != 0` on [FulfillmentApplier.sol#L338](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/main/contracts/lib/FulfillmentApplier.sol#L338)
