# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Most of the solidity contracts have an init function that everyone can call. This could lead to a race condition when the contract is deployed. At that moment a hacker could call the init function and make the deployed contracts useless. Then it would have to be redeployed, costing a lot of gas.  ## Proof of Concept  DAO.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _vault) public { Factory.sol:    function init(address _pool) public { Pools.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _router, address _factory) public { Router.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _pool) public { USDV.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _vault, address _router) external { Utils.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _router, address _pools, address _factory) public { Vader.sol:    function init(address _vether, address _USDV, address _utils) external { Vault.sol:    function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _router, address _factory, address _pool) public {    ## Tools Used Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check to the init function, for example that only the deployer can call the function.
