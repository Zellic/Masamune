Forfeit the rest       uint256 net = balance - bufferRequirement;       _forfeit(net);     } ```  And in `_forfeit`, it requires forfeited (= balance - bufferRequirement) <= declaredBalance.  ```   function _forfeit(uint256 forfeited) internal {     require(forfeited <= declaredBalance, "Cannot forfeit more than declared"); ```  So when an attacker sends some collateral tokens to `LinearDistributor`, the balance will be increased and it can cause revert in `_forfeit` and `declareReward`.  Since `declareReward` sends vested amount before `_forfeit` and the vested amount will be increased by time, so this DOS will be temporary.   ```     uint256 distributed = (linearBondedValue * netVest) / vestingBondedValue;     uint256 balance = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));      if (distributed > balance) {       distributed = balance;     }       if (distributed > 0) {       // Send vested amount to liquidity mine       collateralToken.safeTransfer(address(rewardMine), distributed);       rewardMine.releaseReward(distributed);     }      balance = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this)); ``` But if the attacker increases the balance enough to cover all reward amount in vesting, `declareReward` will always revert and it can cause permanent DOS.  `decrementRewards` updates `declaredBalance`, but it only decreases `declaredBalance`, so it can't mitigate the DOS.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Track collateral token balance and add sweep logic for unused collateral tokens in `LinearDistributor`.
