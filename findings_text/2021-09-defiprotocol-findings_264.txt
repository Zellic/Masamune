# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In Basket.sol, `handleFees` computes the following: `uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * startSupply / totalSupply()`.  In the case that `totalSupply() = 0` (every holder burned their basket), the function reverts since there's a 0/0. This issue won't let new people mint, since `handleFees` is called before any minting.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L124  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adding a check before the division. ``` if (startSupply == 0) {  return; } ```
