However, the underlying yield tokens price may go down. If Luna/UST things happen again, users' funds may get locked.  [LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137) Moreover, the withdrawal of the lidoVault takes a swap from the curve pool. 1 stEth worth 0.98 ETH at the time of writing. The vault can not withdraw at the current market.  Given that users' funds would be locked in the lidoVault, I consider this a high-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept [1 stEth  = 0.98 Eth](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1524717773959700481/photo/1)  [LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137)   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are different ways to set the slippage.   The first one is to let users determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take. The protocol front-end should set the recommended value for them. ```solidity   function withdrawCollateral(     address _asset,     uint256 _amount,     address _to,     uint256 _minReceiveAmount   ) external virtual {       // ...     require(withdrawAmount >= _minReceiveAmount, Errors.VT_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_MISMATCH);   } ```   The second one is have a slippage control parameters that's set by the operator.  ```solidity     // Exchange stETH -> ETH via Curve     uint256 receivedETHAmount = CurveswapAdapter.swapExactTokensForTokens(       _addressesProvider,       _addressesProvider.getAddress('STETH_ETH_POOL'),       LIDO,       ETH,       yieldStETH,       maxSlippage     ); ```  ```solidity     function setMaxSlippage(uint256 _slippage) external onlyOperator {         maxSlippage = _slippage;          //@audit This action usually emit an event.         emit SetMaxSlippage(msg.sender, slippage);     } ```  These are two common ways to deal with this issue. I prefer the first one. The market may corrupt really fast before the operator takes action. It's nothing fun watching the number go down while having no option.
