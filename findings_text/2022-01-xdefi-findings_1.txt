# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Reduction of potential gas refunds.  ## Proof of Concept  The reentrancy guard variable is initially set to zero, set to a nonzero value and then reset to zero:  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L29-L35  We then have to the higher cost for writing to clean storage rather than dirty storage (which is then refunded). This is not recommended as it can cause the size of the gas refunded to users to be capped. For more info see the OZ implementation:  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L29-L35  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change from 0->1->0 to 1->2->1
