# Handle  robee   # Vulnerability details  Reading a storage variable is gas costly (SLOAD). In cases of multiple read of a storage variable in the same scope, caching the first read (i.e saving as a local variable) can save gas and decrease the  overall gas uses. The following is a list of functions and the storage variables that you read twice:           CDSTemplate.sol: parameters.getLockup is read twice in withdraw         Factory.sol: registry is read twice in createMarket         IndexTemplate.sol: totalAllocPoint is read twice in set         IndexTemplate.sol: MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 is read twice in withdrawable         PoolTemplate.sol: parameters.getLockup is read twice in withdraw         PoolTemplate.sol: lockedAmount is read twice in utilizationRate         PoolTemplate.sol: MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 is read twice in allocateCredit         PoolTemplate.sol: MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 is read twice in withdrawCredit         PoolTemplate.sol: MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 is read twice in insure         PoolTemplate.sol: MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 is read twice in resume         BondingPremium.sol: k is read twice in getCurrentPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: k is read twice in getPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: c is read twice in getPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: b is read twice in getCurrentPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: b is read twice in getPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: T_1 is read twice in getCurrentPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: T_1 is read twice in getPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: BASE is read twice in getCurrentPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: BASE is read twice in getPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: BASE_x2 is read twice in getCurrentPremiumRate         BondingPremium.sol: BASE_x2 is read twice in getPremiumRate         Vault.sol: token is read twice in repayDebt         Vault.sol: token is read twice in utilize         Vault.sol: token is read twice in withdrawRedundant         Vault.sol: totalAttributions is read twice in attributionValue         Vault.sol: balance is read twice in valueAll         Vault.sol: balance is read twice in withdrawRedundant
