# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The locks implement three different approval types, see `onlyKeyManagerOrApproved` for an overview: - key manager (map `keyManagerOf`) - single-person approvals (map `approved`). Cleared by `_clearApproval` or `_setKeyManagerOf` - operator approvals (map `managerToOperatorApproved`)  The `MixinTransfer.transferFrom` requires any of the three approval types in the `onlyKeyManagerOrApproved` modifier on the tokenId to authenticate transfers from `from`.  Notice that if the `to` address previously had a key but it expired only the `_setKeyManagerOf` call is performed, which does not clear `approved` if the key manager was already set to 0:  ```solidity function transferFrom(   address _from,   address _recipient,   uint _tokenId )   public   onlyIfAlive   hasValidKey(_from)   onlyKeyManagerOrApproved(_tokenId) {   // @audit this is skipped if user had a key that expired   if (toKey.tokenId == 0) {     toKey.tokenId = _tokenId;     _recordOwner(_recipient, _tokenId);     // Clear any previous approvals     _clearApproval(_tokenId);   }    if (previousExpiration <= block.timestamp) {     // The recipient did not have a key, or had a key but it expired. The new expiration is the sender's key expiration     // An expired key is no longer a valid key, so the new tokenID is the sender's tokenID     toKey.expirationTimestamp = fromKey.expirationTimestamp;     toKey.tokenId = _tokenId;      // Reset the key Manager to the key owner     // @audit  doesn't clear approval if key manager already was 0     _setKeyManagerOf(_tokenId, address(0));      _recordOwner(_recipient, _tokenId);   }   // ... }  //  function _setKeyManagerOf(   uint _tokenId,   address _keyManager ) internal {   // @audit-ok only clears approved if key manager updated   if(keyManagerOf[_tokenId] != _keyManager) {     keyManagerOf[_tokenId] = _keyManager;     _clearApproval(_tokenId);     emit KeyManagerChanged(_tokenId, address(0));   } } ```  ## Impact It's possible to sell someone a key and then claim it back as the approvals are not always cleared.  ## POC - Attacker A has a valuable key (`tokenId = 42`) with an expiry date far in the future. - A sets approvals for their second attacker controlled account A' by calling `MixinKeys.setApprovalForAll(A', true)`, which sets `managerToOperatorApproved[A][A'] = true`. - A clears the key manager by setting it to zero, for example, by transferring it to a second account that does not have a key yet, this calls the above `_setKeyManagerOf(42, address(0));` in `transferFrom` - A sets single-token approval to A' by calling `MixinKeys.approve(A', 42)`, setting `approved[42] = A'`. - A sells the token to a victim V for a discount (compared to purchasing it from the Lock). The victim needs to have owned a key before which already expired. The `transferFrom(A, V, 42)` call sets the owner of token 42 to `V`, but does not clear the `approved[42] == A'` field as described above. (`_setKeyManagerOf(_tokenId, address(0));` is called but the key manager was already zero, which then does not clear approvals.) - A' can claim back the token by calling `transferFrom(V, A', 42)` and the `onlyKeyManagerOrApproved(42)` modifier will pass as `approved[42] == A'` is still set.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `_setKeyManagerOf` function should not handle clearing approvals of single-token approvals (`approved`) as these are two separate approval types. The `transferFrom` function should always call `_clearApproval` in the `(previousExpiration <= block.timestamp)` case.
