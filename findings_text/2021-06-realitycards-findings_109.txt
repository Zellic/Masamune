# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Orderbook.removeBids() as commented “///remove bids in closed markets for a given user ///this can reduce the users bidRate and chance to foreclose”  removeOldBids() is performed currently in Market.newRental() and Treasury.deposit() to  “do some cleaning up, it might help cancel their foreclosure” as commented. However, this is missing in the withdrawDeposit() function where the need is the most because user is removing deposit which may lead to foreclosure and is even commented as being useful on L356.  Impact: If we do not remove closed market bids during withdrawDeposit, the closed market bids still get accounted in user's bidrate in the conditional on L357 and therefore do not prevent the foreclosure in withdrawDeposit that may happen in L357-L367. User may get foreclosed because of mis-accounted closed-market bids in the order book.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCOrderbook.sol#L671-L713  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L356  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L357-L367  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L704-L705  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L300-L301   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add call to removeOldBids() on L355 of withdrawDeposit() of Treasury.
