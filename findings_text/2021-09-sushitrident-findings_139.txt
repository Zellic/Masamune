# Handle  hack3r-0m   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/libraries/MathUtils.sol#L22 the difference is computed incorrectly when a > b.  As it only used in within1 function, scope narrows down to where `difference(a, b) <= 1;` is exploitable.  cases where `difference(a, b) <= 1` should be true but is reported false: - where b = a-1 (returned value is type(uint256).max)  cases where `difference(a, b) <= 1` should be false but is reported true: - where a = type(uint256).max and b = 0, it returns 1 but it should ideally return type(uint256).max  within1 is used at the following locations: - https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/HybridPool.sol#L359 - https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/HybridPool.sol#L383 - https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/HybridPool.sol#L413  It is possible to decrease the denominator and increase the value of the numerator (when calculating y) using constants and input to make within1 fail  Mitigation:  Add `else` condition to mitigate it.  ``` unchecked {           if (a > b) {               diff = a - b;           }           else {               diff = b - a;              }       } ```  (re-submitting this issue after withdrawing past one since I forgot to add more  details and POC)
