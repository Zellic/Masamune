The user can use a large amount of Ether to get a large _buyoutBid variable, however the actual amount of Ether spent by the user is _currentValuation. Events emitted by the smart contract are used off-chain, and incorrect event parameters may have an impact on the user's trading behavior  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L414-L417 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps ``` -       emit BuyoutInitiated(msg.sender, _buyoutBid); +      emit BuyoutInitiated(msg.sender, _currentValuation); ```
