Later it is checked that the balance of `cnote` in the `treasury` address must be 0. However, all calculations related to `amtToSweep` come out of the balance of [address(this)](https://github.dev/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/2646a7676b721db8a7754bf5503dcd712eab2f8a/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L83-L84) so if a third party sends a single token `cnote` to the address of `treasury` the method will be denied.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - Check that the balance is the same after and before the `bool success = cnote.transfer(treasury, amtToSweep);`
