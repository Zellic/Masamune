# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/lender/Lender.sol#L297   # Vulnerability details  The Swivel `lend` method adds to `fees[u]` the order fee, but does not pull that fee from the user. It only pulls the order-post-fee amount.  ## Impact `withdrawFee` will fail, as it tries to transfer more tokens than are in the contract.  ## Proof of Concept The Swivel `lend` method [sums up](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/lender/Lender.sol#L279:#L283) the fees to `totalFee`, and the amount to send to Swivel in `lent`: ```                     totalFee += fee;                     // Amount lent for this order                     uint256 amountLent = amount - fee;                     // Sum the total amount lent to Swivel (amount of ERC5095 tokens to mint) minus fees                     lent += amountLent; ``` It then [increments](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/lender/Lender.sol#L294:#L297) `fees[u]` by `totalFee`, but only pulls from the user `lent`: ```             fees[u] += totalFee;             // transfer underlying tokens from user to illuminate             Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), msg.sender, address(this), lent); ``` Therefore, `totalFee` has not been pulled from the user. The `fees` variable now includes tokens which are not in the contract, and `withdrawFee` will fail as [it tries to transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/main/lender/Lender.sol#L667) `fees[u]`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Pull `lent + totalFee` from the user.
