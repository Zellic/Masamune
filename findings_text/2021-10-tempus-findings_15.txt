# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Increased gas costs on several `TempusPool` functions  ## Proof of Concept  `TempusPool`s have a `finalize` function which checks whether `block.timestamp >= maturityTime` and flips the `maturity` storage variable as well as setting `maturityInterestRate` to the current interest rate.  https://github.com/tempus-finance/tempus-protocol/blob/0240b4d172d7aa093a70e0401f4140c99aa30dc6/contracts/TempusPool.sol#L126-L135  `maturity` is used in several places to check whether the pool has expired however checking this variable is more expensive than checking `block.timestamp >= maturityTime` (due to the need for a SLOAD whereas `maturityTime` is immutable so no SLOAD is needed). I'd recommend making a `function matured() public view` to keep the readability.  However `maturityInterestRate` still needs to be set correctly. This could be done by reading the current interest rate when `matured()` returns true but `maturityInterestRate == 0` this could cause issues with some functions which are currently view functions however.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Half solution:  Replace `matured` state variable with a `matured()` view function which returns `maturityInterestRate > 0`. This removes an SSTORE from `finalize` and an `SLOAD` from any function which uses `maturityInterestRate` as you can just check if it's greater than zero to see if the pool has matured.  Full solution:   Replace `matured` state variable with a `matured()` view function which returns  `block.timestamp >= maturityTime`. This combined with setting `maturityInterestRate` when you see that `matured() == true` and `maturityInterestRate == 0` would remove the need for the `finalize` function entirely.
