# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In Market sponsor() the call to treasury.checkSponsorship() checks allowance and balance  of user. This is redundant because the call to treasury.sponsor downstream checks allowance again and insufficient balance would cause any transfer to fail anyway.  Impact: Given the gas sensitivity of the code base, removing this redundant check could help conserve gas and prevent any DoS from breaking gas limits.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L810  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L386-L396  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L474-L478   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove redundant checks.
