However, this function completely lacks any access control (it’s just `public`) so an attacker can monitor the mempool and frontrun the transaction in order to become both `accountant` and `admin`  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The function should:  1. have a guard that regulates access control 2. not set the `admin` too, which is dangerous and out of scope
