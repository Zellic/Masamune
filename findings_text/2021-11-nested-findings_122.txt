# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `name` and `destination` local variables in the `rebuildCache` function are declared multiple times within the loop. It'll be cheaper to declare them once outside the loop and reuse the variables inside.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx bytes32 name; address destination; // The resolver must call this function whenever it updates its state for (uint256 i = 0; i < requiredAddresses.length; i++) {  name = requiredAddresses[i];  // Note: can only be invoked once the resolver has all the targets needed added  destination = resolver.getAddress(name);   ... } ```
