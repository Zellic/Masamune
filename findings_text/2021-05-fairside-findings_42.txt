# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The credit score of the special `address(type(uint160).max)` is supposed to represent the sum of the credit scores of all users that are governors. But any user can directly transfer to this address increasing its balance and accumulating a credit score in `_updateConvictionScore(to=address(uint160.max), amount)`. It'll first write a snapshot of this address' balance which should be very low:  ```solidity // in _updateConvictionScore _writeCheckpoint(user, userNum, userNew) = _writeCheckpoint(TOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCORE, userNum, checkpoints[user][userNum - 1].convictionScore + convictionDelta); ```  This address then accumulates a score based on its balance which can be updated using `updateConvictionScore(uint160.max)` and breaks the invariant.  ## Impact Increasing it might be useful for non-governors that don't pass the voting threshold and want to grief the proposal voting system by increasing the `quorumVotes` threshold required for proposals to pass. (by manipulating `FairSideDAO.totalVotes`). `totalVotes` can be arbitrarily inflated and break the voting mechanism as no proposals can reach the quorum (percentage of `totalVotes`) anymore.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Disallow transfers from/to this address. Or better, track the total governance credit score in a separate variable, not in an address.
