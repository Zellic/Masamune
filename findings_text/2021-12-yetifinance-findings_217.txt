# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  When changing collateral's ratio, it is rightly checked to be smaller than 110%. However when adding new collateral, the ratio check is not there, so it can be added with ratio that is larger than 110%.  ## Impact Accidentally adding an asset with larger ratio would result in users being able to withdraw more YUSD than supplied VC.  ## Proof of Concept When an asset is being added, there is no sanity check that the ratio is within the correct range. [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/Dependencies/Whitelist.sol#L92:#L127)  This is unlike `changeRatio`, which validates that the new ratio is in correct range. [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/Dependencies/Whitelist.sol#L204) ``` require(_ratio < 1100000000000000000, "ratio must be less than 1.10 => greater than 1.1 would mean taking out more YUSD than collateral VC"); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the same ratio check to `addCollateral`.
