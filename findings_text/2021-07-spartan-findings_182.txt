# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Router.addDividend` function tells the reserve to send dividends to the pool depending on the fees.  - The attacker provides LP to a curated pool. Ideally, they become a large LP holder to capture most of the profit, they should choose the smallest liquidity pool as the dividends are pool-independent. - The `normalAverageFee` variable that determines the pool dividends can be set to zero by the attacker by trading a single wei in the pool `arrayFeeSize` (20) times (use `buyTo`). The fees of the single wei trades will be zero and thus the `normalAverageFee` will also be zero as, see `addTradeFee`. - The attacker then does a trade that generates some non-zero fees, setting the `normalAverageFee` to this trade's fee. The `feeDividend` is then computed as `_fees * dailyAllocation / (_fees + normalAverageFee) = _fees * dailyAllocation / (2 * _fees) = dailyAllocation / 2`. Half of the `dailyAllocation` is sent to the pool. - The attacker repeats the above steps until the reserve is almost empty. Each time the `dailyAllocation` gets smaller but it's still possible to withdraw almost all of it. - They redeem their LP tokens and gain a share of the profits  ## Impact The reserve can be emptied by the attacker.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Counting only the last 20 trades as a baseline for the dividends does not work. It should probably average over a timespan but even that can be gamed if it is too short. I think a better idea is to compute the dividends based on **volume** traded over a timespan instead of looking at individual trades.
