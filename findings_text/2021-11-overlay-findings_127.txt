# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Overlay uses OZ contracts version 4.3.2: ```yaml   dependencies:     - OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2 ``` and has a contract that inherits from ERC1155Supply: ```solidity   contract OverlayV1OVLCollateral is ERC1155Supply ``` This version has a recently discovered vulnerability: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wmpv-c2jp-j2xg  In your case, function unwind relies on totalSupply when calculating _userNotional, _userDebt, _userCost, and _userOi, so a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by first calling 'build' and then on callback 'unwind' in the same transaction before the total supply is updated.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider updating to a patched version of 4.3.3.
