As reward token list is external and an arbitrary token can end up there, in the case when such token doesn't allow for zero amount transfers, the reward retrieval can become unavailable.  I.e. processYield() can be fully blocked for even an extended period, with some low probability, which cannot be controlled otherwise as pool reward token list is external.  Setting the severity to medium as reward gathering is a base functionality for the system and its availability is affected.  ## Proof of Concept  _transferYield proceeds with sending the amounts to treasury and yieldManager without checking:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L74-L82  ```solidity     // transfer to treasury     if (_vaultFee > 0) {       uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);       yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);     }      // transfer to yieldManager     address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');     TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount); ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L205-L209  ```solidity   function _processTreasury(address _asset, uint256 _yieldAmount) internal returns (uint256) {     uint256 treasuryAmount = _yieldAmount.percentMul(_vaultFee);     IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_treasuryAddress, treasuryAmount);     return treasuryAmount;   } ```  The incentive token can be arbitrary. Some ERC20 do not allow zero amounts to be sent:  https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers  In a situation of such a token added to reward list and zero incentive amount earned the whole processYield call will revert, making reward gathering unavailable until either such token be removed from pool's reward token list or some non-zero reward amount be earned. Both are external processes and aren’t controllable.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider running the transfers in _transferYield only when yieldAmount is positive:  ```solidity + if (yieldAmount > 0) {      // transfer to treasury      if (_vaultFee > 0) {        uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);        yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);      }       // transfer to yieldManager      address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');      TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount); +  } ```
