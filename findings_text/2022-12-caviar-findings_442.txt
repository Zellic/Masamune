Create and add `1 wei baseToken - 1 wei quoteToken` to the pair. At this moment, attacker is minted `1 wei LP token` because `sqrt(1 * 1) = 1` 2. Transfer large amount of `baseToken` and `quoteToken` directly to the pair, such as `1e9 baseToken - 1e9 quoteToken`. Since no new LP token is minted, `1 wei LP token` worths `1e9 baseToken - 1e9 quoteToken`. 3. Normal users add liquidity to pool will receive `0` LP token if they add less than `1e9` token because of rounding division. ```solidity baseTokenShare = (X * 1) / 1e9; fractionalTokenShare = (Y * 1) / 1e9; ```   ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - [Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when `lpTokenSupply == 0`, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution. - In `add()`, ensure the number of LP tokens to be minted is non-zero: ```solidity require(lpTokenAmount != 0, "No LP minted"); ```
