# Handle  ScopeLift   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  On lines 85 and 101, ETH is transferred using a `.call` to an address provided as an input, but there is no verification that the call call succeeded. This can result in a call to `emergencyWithdrawGAS` or `partialWithdrawGAS` appearing successful but in reality it failed. This can happen when the provided `destination` address is a contract that cannot receive ETH, or if the `amount` provided is larger than the contract's balance  ## Proof of Concept  Enter the following in remix, deploy the `Receiver` contract, and send 1 ETH when deploying the `Permissions` contract. Call `emergencyWithdrawGAS` with the receiver address and you'll see it reverts. This would not be caught in the current code  ```solidity pragma solidity ^0.8.0;  contract Receivier{}  contract Permissions {     constructor() payable {}      function emergencyWithdrawGAS(address payable destination) external {         (bool ok, ) = destination.call{value: address(this).balance}('');         require(ok, "call failed");     } } ```  ## Tools Used  Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  In `emergencyWithdrawGAS`:  ```diff - destination.call{value: address(this).balance}(''); + (bool ok, ) = destination.call{value: address(this).balance}(''); + require(ok, "call failed"); ```  And similar for `partialWithdrawGAS`
