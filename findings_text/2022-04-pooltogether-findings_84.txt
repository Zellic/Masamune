Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead > When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.  https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html Use a larger size then downcast where needed  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #1  47       uint8 decimals, ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L47  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #2  136     uint8 private immutable _decimals; ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L136  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #3  145     uint16 private constant REFERRAL_CODE = uint16(188); ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L145  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #4  165       uint8 decimals_, ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L165  ```diff diff --git a/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.orig b/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.new index 3975311..0dfa477 100644 --- a/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.orig +++ b/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.new @@ -44,7 +44,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {      IPoolAddressesProviderRegistry poolAddressesProviderRegistry,      string name,      string symbol, -    uint8 decimals, +    uint256 decimals,      address owner    );   @@ -133,7 +133,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {    IPoolAddressesProviderRegistry public poolAddressesProviderRegistry;      /// @notice ERC20 token decimals. -  uint8 private immutable _decimals; +  uint256 private immutable _decimals;      /**     * @dev Aave genesis market PoolAddressesProvider's ID. @@ -142,7 +142,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {    uint256 private constant ADDRESSES_PROVIDER_ID = uint256(0);      /// @dev PoolTogether's Aave Referral Code -  uint16 private constant REFERRAL_CODE = uint16(188); +  uint256 private constant REFERRAL_CODE = 188;      /* ============ Constructor ============ */   @@ -162,7 +162,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {      IPoolAddressesProviderRegistry _poolAddressesProviderRegistry,      string memory _name,      string memory _symbol, -    uint8 decimals_, +    uint256 decimals_,      address _owner    ) Ownable(_owner) ERC20(_name, _symbol) ReentrancyGuard() {      require(address(_aToken) != address(0), "AaveV3YS/aToken-not-zero-address"); @@ -218,7 +218,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {     * @return The number of decimals.     */    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) { -    return _decimals; +    return uint8(_decimals);    }      /** @@ -234,7 +234,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {        address _underlyingAssetAddress = _tokenAddress();      IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _depositAmount); -    _pool().supply(_underlyingAssetAddress, _depositAmount, address(this), REFERRAL_CODE); +    _pool().supply(_underlyingAssetAddress, _depositAmount, address(this), uint16(REFERRAL_CODE));        _mint(_to, _shares); ```  ```diff diff --git a/gas.orig b/gas.new index d87edc2..367daee 100644 --- a/gas.orig +++ b/gas.new @@ -29,7 +29,7 @@  ·····························|··························|·············|·············|·············|···············|··············  |  Deployments                                          ·                                         ·  % of limit   ·             │  ························································|·············|·············|·············|···············|·············· -|  AaveV3YieldSourceHarness                             ·    2505760  ·    2505772  ·    2505770  ·        8.4 %  ·          -  │ +|  AaveV3YieldSourceHarness                             ·    2505659  ·    2505671  ·    2505669  ·        8.4 %  ·          -  │  ························································|·············|·············|·············|···············|··············  |  ERC20Mintable                                        ·          -  ·          -  ·    1154099  ·        3.8 %  ·          -  │  ·-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------· ```  ### 5.

Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable` If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are  `CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #1  275     function claimRewards(address _to) external onlyManagerOrOwner returns (bool) { ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L275  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #2  296     function decreaseERC20Allowance( 297       IERC20 _token, 298       address _spender, 299       uint256 _amount 300     ) external onlyManagerOrOwner { ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L296-L300  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #3  315     function increaseERC20Allowance( 316       IERC20 _token, 317       address _spender, 318       uint256 _amount 319     ) external onlyManagerOrOwner { ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L315-L319  ```solidity File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #4  332     function transferERC20( 333       IERC20 _token, 334       address _to, 335       uint256 _amount 336     ) external onlyManagerOrOwner { ``` https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L332-L336  ```diff diff --git a/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.orig b/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.new index 3975311..b16b82a 100644 --- a/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.orig +++ b/AaveV3YieldSource.sol.new @@ -272,7 +272,7 @@ contract AaveV3YieldSource is ERC20, IYieldSource, Manageable, ReentrancyGuard {     * @param _to Address where the claimed rewards will be sent     * @return True if operation was successful.     */ -  function claimRewards(address _to) external onlyManagerOrOwner returns (bool) { +  function claimRewards(address _to) payable external onlyManagerOrOwner returns (bool) {      require(_to != address(0), "AaveV3YS/payee-not-zero-address");
