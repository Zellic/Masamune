# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function addToWhitelist of RCTreasury.sol does a call to the factory contract, however the factoryAddress might not be initialized, because it is set via a different function (setFactoryAddress). The function addToWhitelist will revert when it calls a 0 address, but it might be more difficult to troubleshoot.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L233    function setFactoryAddress(address _newFactory) external override {         ...         factoryAddress = _newFactory;     }  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L210     function addToWhitelist(address _user) public override {         IRCFactory factory = IRCFactory(factoryAddress);         require(factory.isGovernor(msgSender()), "Not authorised");         isAllowed[_user] = !isAllowed[_user];     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Verify that factoryAddress is set in the function addToWhitelist, for example using the following code.  require(factory != address(0), "Must have an address");
