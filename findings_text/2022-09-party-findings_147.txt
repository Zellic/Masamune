Everyone who contributed wins.                 lastBid_ = totalContributions; ``` But if the contract was bid before the NFT was gifted to the contract, then since lastBid_ ! = 0, only the user who contributed at the beginning will win. ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/AuctionCrowdfund.sol#L233-L242 https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/AuctionCrowdfund.sol#L149-L175 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Whether or not NFT is free to get should be determined using whether the contract balance is greater than totalContributions
