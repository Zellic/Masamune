# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## Revert strings  ### Consider using custom errors instead of revert strings  Can save gas when the revert condition has been met. And also during runtime.  ### Consider shortening revert strings to less than 32 bytes  Revert strings more than 32 bytes require at least one additional `mstore`, along with additional operations for computing memory offset, etc.  Even if you need a string to represent an error, it can usually be done in less than 32 bytes / characters.  Here are some examples of strings that can be shortened from codebase:  ``` txt ./contracts/TransactionManager.sol:96:      "addLiquidity: ETH_WITH_ERC_TRANSFER" ./contracts/TransactionManager.sol:97:      "addLiquidity: ERC20_TRANSFER_FAILED" ./contracts/TransactionManager.sol:122:     "removeLiquidity: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS" ```  Note that this will only decrease runtime gas when the revert condition has been met. Regardless, it will decrease deploy time gas.
