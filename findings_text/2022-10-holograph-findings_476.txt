This function makes an internal call to `_payoutEth`, which sends the payment to the recipients based on their associated `bp`  The issue is that the `balance` used in the `transfer` calls is not the contract ETH balance, but the balance minus a `gasCost`.  This means `getEthPayout()` calls will leave dust in the contract.  ## Impact  If the dust is small enough, a subsequent call to `getEthPayout` is likely to revert because of [this check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L390). And `enforcer/PA1D` does not have any other ETH withdrawal function. While `enforcer/PA1D` is meant to be used via delegate calls from a NFT collection contract, if the NFT contract does not have any withdrawal function either, this dust mentioned above is effectively lost.  ## Proof-Of-Concept  Let us take the example of a payout recipient trying to retrieve their share of the balance, equal to `40_000` For simplicity, assume one payout address, owned by Alice:  - Alice calls `getEthPayout()`, which in turn calls `_payoutEth()` - `gasCost = (23300 * length) + length = 23300 + 1 = 23301` - `balance = address(this).balance = 40000` - `balance - gasCost = 40000 - 23301 = 16699`, - `sending = ((bps[i] * balance) / 10000) = 10000 * 16699 / 10000 = 16699` - Alice receives `16699`.  Alice has to wait for the balance to increase to call `getEthPayout()` again. But no matter what, there will always be at least a dust of `10000` left in the contract.   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis   ## Mitigation  The transfers should be done based on `address(this).balance`. The `gasCost` is redundant as the gas amount is specified by the caller of `getEthPayout()`, the contract does not have to provide gas.  ```diff -391: balance = balance - gasCost; 392:     uint256 sending; 393:     // uint256 sent; 394:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) { 395:       sending = ((bps[i] * balance) / 10000); 396:       addresses[i].transfer(sending); 397:       // sent = sent + sending; 398:     } ```
