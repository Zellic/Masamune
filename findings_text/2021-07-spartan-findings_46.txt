# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The `swapTo()` function should not be payable since the WBNB-SPARTA pool should not receive BNB, but WBNB. The router swap functions handles the wrapping and unwrapping of BNB.  Furthermore, the `swapTo()` will not detect any deposited BNB, so any swapTo() calls that have msg.value > 0 will have their BNB permanently locked in the pool contract.   ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove `payable` keyword in `swapTo()`.
