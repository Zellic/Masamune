# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The claiming of staking and governance tributes for the a beneficiary's vested tokens should be no different than other users / EOAs. However, the `claimTribute()` and `claimGovernanceTribute()` are missing the actual claiming calls to the corresponding functions of the FSD token contract. As a result, the accrued rewards are taken from the beneficiary's vested token while not claiming (replenishing) from the FSD token contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  In addition to what has been mentioned above, the internal accounting for claimedTribute states can be removed because they are already performed in the FSD token contract.  ```jsx // TODO: Remove _claimedTribute and _claimedGovernanceTribute mappings  /** * @dev Allows claiming of staking tribute by `msg.sender` during their vesting period. * It updates the claimed status of the vest against the tribute * being claimed. * * Requirements: * - claiming amount must not be 0. */ function claimTribute(uint256 num) external onlyBeneficiary {     uint256 tribute = fsd.availableTribute(num);     require(tribute != 0, "FSDVesting::claimTribute: No tribute to claim");   fsd.claimTribute(num);     fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tribute);     emit TributeClaimed(msg.sender, tribute); }  /** * @dev Allows claiming of governance tribute by `msg.sender` during their vesting period. * It updates the claimed status of the vest against the tribute * being claimed. * * Requirements: * - claiming amount must not be 0. */ function claimGovernanceTribute(uint256 num) external onlyBeneficiary {   uint256 tribute = fsd.availableGovernanceTribute(num);   require(     tribute != 0,     "FSDVesting::claimGovernanceTribute: No governance tribute to claim"   );   fsd.claimGovernanceTribute(num);   fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tribute);   emit GovernanceTributeClaimed(msg.sender, tribute); } ```
