# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  A certain amount of lp tokens (shares of the vault) will be minted to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury` as `performanceFee`, the amount is calculated based on the `minLpPriceFactor`.  However, the current formula for `toMint` is wrong, which issues more than 100% of the current totalSupply of the lp token to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury` each time. Causing users to lose 50% to 100% of their funds after a few times.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/LpIssuer.sol#L269-L271  ```solidity=269 address treasury = strategyParams.strategyPerformanceTreasury; uint256 toMint = (baseSupply * minLpPriceFactor) / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR; _mint(treasury, toMint); ```  ### PoC  Given:  - `strategyParams.performanceFee`: `10e7` (1%)  1. Alice deposited `1,000 USDC`, received `1000` lpToken; the totalSupply of the lpToken is now: `1000`; 2. 3 days later, `baseTvl` increased to `1,001 USDC`, Bob deposited `1 USDC` and trigegred `_chargeFees()`:  - Expected Result: `strategyPerformanceTreasury` to receive about `0.01` lpToken (1% of 1 USDC); - Actual Result: `minLpPriceFactor` is about `1.001`, and `strategyPerformanceTreasury` will received `1001` lpToken as performanceFee; Alice lose 50% of deposited funds.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity address treasury = strategyParams.strategyPerformanceTreasury; uint256 toMint = (baseSupply * (minLpPriceFactor - CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR) * performanceFee  / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR) / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR; _mint(treasury, toMint); ```
