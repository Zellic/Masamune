The source code has a comment included which states that "Approval is revoked, in order to avoid unintended transfer allowance if this wallet ever returns to the previous owner" ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/smart-wallet/OwnableSmartWallet.sol#L105-L106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/smart-wallet/OwnableSmartWallet.sol#L105-L106)).    This means that when ownership is transferred from User A to User B, the approvals that User A has given should be revoked.    The existing code does not however revoke all approvals that User A has given. It only revokes one approval.    This can lead to unwanted transfers of ownership.    ## Proof of Concept 1. User A approves User B and User C to claim ownership 2. User B claims ownership first 3. Only User A's approval for User B is revoked, not however User A's approval for User C 4. User B transfers ownerhsip back to User A 5. Now User C can claim ownership even though this time User A has not approved User C  ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps You should invalidate all approvals User A has given when another User becomes the owner of the OwnableSmartWallet.    Unfortunately you cannot use a statement like `delete _isTransferApproved[owner()]`.    So you would need an array that keeps track of approvals as pointed out in this StackExchange question: [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15553/how-to-delete-a-mapping](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15553/how-to-delete-a-mapping)
