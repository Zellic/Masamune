# Handle  jvaqa   # Vulnerability details  RCFactory.createMarket() does not enforce _timestamps[1] and _timestamps[2] being larger than _timestamps[0], even though proper functioning requires them to be so.  ## Impact  IRCMarket defines a sequence of events that each market should progress through sequentially, CLOSED, OPEN, LOCKED, WITHDRAW. // [1]  The comments explicitly state that _incrementState() should be called "thrice". // [2]  However, it is possible to create a market where these events do not occur sequentially.  You can create a market where the marketOpeningTime is later than the marketLockingTime and oracleResolutionTime.  This is because although RCFactory checks to ensure that _timestamps[2] is greater than _timestamps[1], it does not check to ensure that _timestamps[1] is greater than _timestamps[0]. // [3]  This is also because although RCFactory checks to ensure that _timestamps[0] is equal to or greater than block.timestamp, it makes no check for a minimum value for _timestamps[1] or _timestamps[2], or a relative check between the value of _timestamps[0] and _timestamps[1]. // [4]  Thus, you can create a market where the marketLockingTime and the oracleResolutionTime occur before the marketOpeningTime.  ## Proof of Concept  When calling RCFactory.createMarket(), Alice can supply 0 as the argument for _timestamps[1] and _timestamps[2], and any value equal to or greater than block.timestamp for _timestamps[0]. // [5]  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the following check to RCFactory.createMarket():  require(     _timestamps[0] < _timestamps[1],     "market must begin before market can lock" );  [1] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/interfaces/IRCMarket.sol#L7  [2] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L1093  [3] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L539  [4] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L521  [5] https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L468
