# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  As per the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.1/abi-spec.html?highlight=events#events):  However, for all “complex” types or types of dynamic length, including all arrays, string, bytes and structs, EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS will contain the Keccak hash of a special in-place encoded value (see Encoding of Indexed Event Parameters), rather than the encoded value directly.  It therefore might not be useful to index `address[] targets` in `Timelock.sol` and `address[] contacts` in `EmergencyBrake.sol`, since it's the keccak hash of the addresses. [Also saves gas to drop the indexed keyword](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/56486/does-it-make-a-difference-to-index-an-event-with-one-parameter/56491).  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the `indexed` keyword for the arguments mentioned above.
