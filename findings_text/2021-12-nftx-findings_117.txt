# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `provideInventory1155()` function in contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol contains a for loop that uses tokenIds.length to loop through the amounts array. However, if these two arrays are not the same length, the loop with trigger an error. The error could be triggered after many operations already occur, so checking that these two lengths are equal first could save gas.  ## Proof of Concept  The `provideInventory1155()` function contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/194073f750b7e2c9a886ece34b6382b4f1355f36/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L201  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are two main options to reducing the gas spend in an error condition: 1. Add the following line as the first line of the `provideInventory1155()` function: `require(tokenIds.length == amounts.length)` 2. In the for loop within the `provideInventory1155()` function, replace `i < tokenIds.length` with `i < amounts.length;`
