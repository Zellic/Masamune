# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  The purpose of a Timelock contract is to put a limit on the privileges of the `governor`, by forcing a two step process with a preset delay time.  However, we found that the current implementation actually won't serve that purpose as it allows the `governor` to execute any transactions without any constraints.  To do that, the current governor can call `Timelock#setGovernor(address _governor)` and set a new `governor` effective immediately.  And the new `governor` can then call `Timelock#setDelay()` and change the delay to `0`, also effective immediately.  The new `governor` can now use all the privileges without a delay, including granting minter role to any address and mint unlimited amount of MALT.  In conclusion, a Timelock contract is supposed to guard the protocol from lost private key or malicious actions. The current implementation won't fulfill that mission.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Timelock.sol#L98-L105 ```solidity=98{100,102-103}   function setGovernor(address _governor)     public     onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")   {     _swapRole(_governor, governor, GOVERNOR_ROLE);     governor = _governor;     emit NewGovernor(_governor);   } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Timelock.sol#L66-L77 ```solidity=66{71,74}   function setDelay(uint256 _delay)     public     onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")   {     require(       _delay >= 0 && _delay < gracePeriod,       "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must not be greater equal to zero and less than gracePeriod"     );     delay = _delay;      emit NewDelay(delay);   } ```   ## Recommendation  Consider making `setGovernor` and `setDelay` only callable from the Timelock contract itself.  Specificaly, changing from `onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")` to `require(msg.sender == address(this), "...")`.  Also, consider changing `_adminSetup(_admin)` in `Timelock#initialize()` to `_adminSetup(address(this))`, so that all roles are managed by the timelock itself as well.
