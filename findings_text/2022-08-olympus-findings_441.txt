This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:  * [Historical Price data](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds) * [Checking Your returned answers](https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round)  The result of `latestRoundData` API will be used across various functions, therefore, a stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adding the missing checks for stale data.  For example: ```js (uint80 roundID ,answer,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();  require(answer > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");  require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price"); require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete"); ```
