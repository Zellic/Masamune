This means that two different oracles (potentially with different prices) could be used for _currency -> _base vs. _base -> _currency. Different prices would lead to inconsistent between conversion ratios depending on the direction of the conversion  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change L115 to: if (feedFor[_currency][_base] != IJBPriceFeed(address(0)) || feedFor[_base][_currency] != IJBPriceFeed(address(0))) revert PRICE_FEED_ALREADY_EXISTS()
