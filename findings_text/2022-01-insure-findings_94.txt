# Handle  camden   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `utilize()` function can be called while the controller is the zero address. This will fail. A comment in the constructor says that the controller shouldn't be the zero address.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L350  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps `utilize` should have a check to see if the controller is not the zero address (like `_unutilize`) and give an appropriate error message.
