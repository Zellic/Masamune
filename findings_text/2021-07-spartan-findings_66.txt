# Handle  GalloDaSballo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function `_deposit` sets `mapMemberSynth_lastTime` to a date in the future https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthVault.sol#L107   `mapMemberSynth_lastTime` is also used to calculate rewards earned  `depositForMember` allows anyone, to "make a donation" for the member and cause that member to loose all their accrued rewards  This can't be used for personal gain, but can be used to bring misery to others.   ## Proof of Concept `depositForMember` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthVault.sol#L95 and can be called by anyone  This will set the member  ```  mapMemberSynth_lastTime[_member][_synth] = block.timestamp + minimumDepositTime; // Record deposit time (scope: member -> synth) ```  this can be continuously exploited to make members never earn any reward   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  This is the second submission under the same exploit This can be mitigated by harvesting for the user right before changing `mapMemberSynth_lastTime[_member][_synth]`  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthVault.sol#L107
