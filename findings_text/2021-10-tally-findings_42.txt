# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Swap` contract uses Solidity version 0.8 which already implements overflow checks by default. At the same time, it uses the `SafeMath` library which is more gas expensive than the 0.8 overflow checks.  It should just use the built-in checks and remove `SafeMath` from the dependencies:  ```solidity // @audit can just normal arithmetic here uint256 toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee).mul(boughtERC20Amount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR);  // uint256 toTransfer = (SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee) * boughtERC20Amount / SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR;  // same with many other computations ```
