# Handle  bw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  A [require](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L74) statement in `Factory.sol` could be performed prior to an expensive cross contract call, reducing the amount of gas wasted if the validation fails.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L74  ## Tools Used  N/A  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Move the require statement before `basketImpl.validateWeights(tokens, weights);`
