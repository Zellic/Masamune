# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Calculation of the weights in the function "setRoyaltiesWeight" of FeeSplitter.sol (row 95) can be done more gas efficient.      function setRoyaltiesWeight(uint256 _weight) public onlyOwner {         totalWeights -= royaltiesWeight;         royaltiesWeight = _weight;         totalWeights += _weight;     }  can be rewritten as      function setRoyaltiesWeight(uint256 _weight) public onlyOwner {         totalWeights = totalWeights - royaltiesWeight + _weight;         royaltiesWeight = _weight;     }  => write only once to the storage of totalWeights.  ## Proof of Concept  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps see above
