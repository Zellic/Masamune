# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  None of the Factory owner setter functions emit events to record these changes on-chain for off-chain monitors/tools/interfaces to register the updates and react if necessary.  The impact of this is that a malicious/compromised/careless owner can intentionally/accidentally changes the minLicenseFee, auctionDecrement, auctionMultiplier, bondPercentDiv or ownerSplit values that significantly change the security/financial posture/perception of the protocol. No events are emitted and users may lose funds/confidence without being a chance to exit/engage protocol. The protocol takes a reputation hit.

This will be more transparent and it will make it easier to keep track of the status of the system.
