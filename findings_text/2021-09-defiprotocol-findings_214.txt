# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact This can be refactored to improve precision and gas usage:   _mint(publisher, fee * (BASE - factory.ownerSplit()) / BASE);   _mint(Ownable(address(factory)).owner(), fee * factory.ownerSplit() / BASE);  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Proposed solution:   uint256 factoryOwnerFee = fee * factory.ownerSplit() / BASE;   uint256 publisherFee = fee - factoryOwnerFee;   _mint(Ownable(address(factory)).owner(), factoryOwnerFee);   _mint(publisher, publisherFee); This will result in fewer math operations and better precision cuz multiplication and division are replaced with subtraction.
