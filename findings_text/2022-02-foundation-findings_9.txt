# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/main/contracts/mixins/NFTMarketOffer.sol#L150   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In NFTMarketOffer.sol the adminCancelOffers() function has comments above it that mention   "tokenIds The ids of the NFTs to cancel. This must be the same length as `nftContracts`"  This means that both the tokensIds and nftContracts arrays must be the same length but this is not required in the code of the function itself which can lead to the function failing.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/main/contracts/mixins/NFTMarketOffer.sol#L150  ## Tools Used Manual code review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add to adminCancelOffers() function:   require(nftContracts.length == tokenIds.length, Arrays must be same length");
