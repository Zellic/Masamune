# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  WJLP can only be unwrapped from the Active Pool or Stability Pool. A user who decided to wrap his JLP, but not use all of them in a trove, Wouldn't be able to just unwrap them.  ## Impact Impaired functionality for users. Would have to incur fees for simple unwrapping.  ## Proof of Concept The unwrap functionality is only available from `unwrapFor` function, and that function is only callable from AP or SP. [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L148:#L149) ``` function unwrapFor(address _to, uint _amount) external override {         _requireCallerIsAPorSP(); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Allow anybody to call the function. As it will burn the holder's WJLP, a user could only unwrap tokens that are not in use.
