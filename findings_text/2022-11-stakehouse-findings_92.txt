This check does not serve any purpose and can actually cause the user problems when withdrawing his ETH.    ## Proof of Concept 1. Bob deposits ETH into the GiantPool with the `GiantPoolBase.depositETH` function.      The amount is equal to `MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT + 0.99 * MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT`. 2. Bob witdraws `MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT` ETH from the GiantPool.   3. Bob has `0.99 * MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT` ETH left in the GiantPool. This is a problem since he cannot withdraw this amount of ETH since it is smaller than `MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT`.      In order to withdraw his funds, Bob needs to first add funds to the GiantPool such that the deposited amount is big enough for withdrawal.  However this causes extra transaction fees to be paid (loss of funds) and causes a bad user experience.    ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `require(_amount >= MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT, "Invalid amount");` statement should just be removed. It does not serve any purpose anyway.
