# Handle  csanuragjain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It was observed that _bounties variable is global per basket. Also you are allowed to add 0 amount in bounty. This means if user adds uint256 max times bounty with amount 0, no one can add further bounty on this basket  ## Proof of Concept 1. User calls addBounty function with amount 0 uint256 max times  ```     function addBounty(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) public override returns (uint256) {         // add bounty to basket         token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);         _bounties.push(Bounty({             token: address(token),             amount: amount,             active: true         }));          uint256 id = _bounties.length - 1;         emit BountyAdded(token, amount, id);         return id;     } ```  2. Now noone can call bounty on this basket anymore  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps _bounties should be cleared once auction has been settled
