# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L467   # Vulnerability details  ## Description  HolographERC721.sol is an enforcer contract that fully implements ERC721. In its safeTransferFromFunction there is the following code: ``` if (_isContract(to)) {   require(     (ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC165.supportsInterface.selector) &&       ERC165(to).supportsInterface(ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector) &&       ERC721TokenReceiver(to).onERC721Received(address(this), from, tokenId, data) ==       ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector),     "ERC721: onERC721Received fail"   ); } ``` If the target address is a contract, the enforcer requires the target's onERC721Received() to succeed. However, the call deviates from the [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): ``` interface ERC721TokenReceiver {     /// @notice Handle the receipt of an NFT     /// @dev The ERC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient     ///  after a `transfer`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the     ///  transfer. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the     ///  transaction being reverted.     ///  Note: the contract address is always the message sender.     /// @param _operator The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function     /// @param _from The address which previously owned the token     /// @param _tokenId The NFT identifier which is being transferred     /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format     /// @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`     ///  unless throwing     function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4); } ```  The standard mandates that the first parameter will be the operator - the caller of safeTransferFrom. The enforcer passes instead the address(this) value, in other words the Holographer address. The impact is that any bookkeeping done in target contract, and allow / disallow decision of the transaction, is based on false information.  ## Impact  ERC721 transferFrom's "to" contract may fail to accept transfers, or record credit of transfers incorrectly.   ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Pass the msg.sender parameter, as the ERC721 standard requires.
