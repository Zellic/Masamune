# Handle  Jujic   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Insurance struct in `PoolTemplate .sol` can be optimized to reduce 2 storage slot  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L127-L128 ``` struct Insurance {         uint256 id; //each insuance has their own id         uint256 startTime; //timestamp of starttime         uint256 endTime; //timestamp of endtime         uint256 amount; //insured amount         bytes32 target; //target id in bytes32         address insured; //the address holds the right to get insured         bool status; //true if insurance is not expired or redeemed     } ``` `startTime` and `endTime `store block numbers, and 2^48 is being enough for a very long time. ## Tools Used https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/internals/layout_in_storage.html?highlight=Structs#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The struct can be changed into: ``` struct Insurance {         uint256 id; //each insuance has their own id         uint48 startTime; //timestamp of starttime         uint48 endTime; //timestamp of endtime         address insured; //the address holds the right to get insured         uint256 amount; //insured amount         bytes32 target; //target id in bytes32         bool status; //true if insurance is not expired or redeemed     } ```
