# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact I can't find a reason why totalNftMintCount in Factory can't be replaced with ERC721 totalSupply() to make it less error-prone. As nfthub.mint issues a new token it should automatically increment totalSupply and this assignment won't be needed:       totalNftMintCount = totalNftMintCount + _tokenURIs.length; Also in function setNftHubAddress you need to manually set _newNftMintCount if you want to change nfthub so an invalid value may crash the system. totalSupply() will eliminate totalNftMintCount and make the system more robust.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace totalNftMintCount with nfthub totalSupply() in Factory contract.
