# Handle  heiho1   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Got an error attempting Slither analysis due to Pool2Unipool and Unipool declaring the same contract named LPTokenWrapper.  It is confusing and error prone to have such similarly named contracts and there is no clear benefit to re-using the name.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/5f5bf61209b722ba568623d8446111b1ea5cb61c/packages/contracts/contracts/LPRewards/Pool2Unipool.sol#L23  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/5f5bf61209b722ba568623d8446111b1ea5cb61c/packages/contracts/contracts/LPRewards/Pool2Unipool.sol#L23  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Rename LPTokenWrapper in Pool2Unipool to 'Pool2LPTokenWrapper' and correct any related imports.
