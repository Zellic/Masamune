# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the `_sendForReceiver()` function, there are 2 comments: `// If the receive is not properly processed, send it to the treasury instead.`   and  `// If the allowance has not been spent, it means we can pass it forward to next`  which are contradictory in nature, except for the case of the last receiver in the feeReceivers array.  Looking at the `distribute()` function implementation, should the `receiveRewards()` function return false, fail, or if the `transferFrom()` was not called in its implementation, the rewards will be given to the next receiver, and not the treasury.  ```jsx // Note: some irrelevant lines were omitted for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {   uint256 amountToSend = leftover + ((tokenBalance * _feeReceiver.allocPoint) / allocTotal);   bool complete = _sendForReceiver(_feeReceiver, vaultId, _vault, amountToSend);   if (!complete) {     leftover = amountToSend;   } else {     leftover = 0;  } } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Based on the implementation, the comment `// If the receive is not properly processed, send it to the treasury instead.` should be edited or removed.
