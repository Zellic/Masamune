# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L322-L340  In `Pool.withdrawBorrowedAmount` we set the loan to active and delete the withdrawal deadline (see link).  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L802  When checking whether we can liquidate the pool we check that the loan is active and that `block.timestamp > poolConstants.loanWithdrawalDeadline`. This second condition always resolves true as `poolConstants.loanWithdrawalDeadline = 0` after deletion. We can then save an SLOAD by skipping this second check.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As above.
