# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol#L11   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  It is stated in the documents that "contract ownership management" is used with a timelock;  ```js README.md:   122: - Does it use a timelock function?: Yes but only for contract ownership management and not business critical functions. ```  However, the `function _setupDelayForRenouncingOwnership` where timelock is specified in the `OwnableTwoSteps.sol` contract where `owner` privileges are set is not used in the project, so a timelock cannot be mentioned.  ```solidity  function _setupDelayForRenouncingOwnership(uint256 _delay) internal {         delay = _delay;     } ```   This is stated in the NatSpec comments but there is no definition as stated in the comments;  ```solidity contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol:   40:      *         Delay (for the timelock) must be set by the contract that inherits from this.  ```   ## Tools Used Manuel Code Review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```diff  contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol:      // Delay for the timelock (in seconds)     uint256 public delay;    43       */   44:     constructor(uint256 _delay) {   45:         owner = msg.sender;   +           delay = _delay;   46:     }   47:    48      /**    ```
