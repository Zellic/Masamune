# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect()` to collect their yield, it calcuates the yield based on `position.pool.rangeFeeGrowth()` and `position.feeGrowthInside0, position.feeGrowthInside1`:  https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#L75-L101  When there are enough tokens in `bento.balanceOf`, it will not call `position.pool.collect()` to collect fees from the pool.  This makes the user who `collect()` their yield when there is enough balance to get double yield when they call `burn()` to remove liquidity. Because `burn()` will automatically collect fees on the pool contract.  ## Impact  The yield belongs to other users will be diluted.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider making `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` call `position.pool.collect()` before `position.pool.burn()`. User will need to call `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect()` to collect unclaimed fees after `burn()`.  Or `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect()` can be changed into a `public` method and `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` can call it after `position.pool.burn()`.
