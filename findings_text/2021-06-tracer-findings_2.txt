# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact A liquidator can always claim the liquidation escrow in the following way: - create a second account - setup a complimentary trade in that second account, which will result in a large slippage when executed - call executeTrade (which everyone can call), to execute a trade between his own two accounts with a large slippage - the slippage doesn't hurt because the liquidator owns both accounts - call claimReceipt with the receiptId of the executed order, within the required period (e.g. 15 minutes)  ## Proof of Concept   // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Trader.sol#L67 function executeTrade(Types.SignedLimitOrder[] memory makers, Types.SignedLimitOrder[] memory takers) external override {  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Liquidation.sol#L394  function claimReceipt( uint256 receiptId, Perpetuals.Order[] memory orders, address traderContract) external override {  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps perhaps limit who can call executeTrade
