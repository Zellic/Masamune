# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  When transferring any of the market tokens, a check is performed to see if they have a pending withdrawal and reduce it if their balance falls below the requested amount.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L910-L923  In the case where a user has no pending withdrawal we then perform an unnecessary check on their balance. We could save an SLOAD by changing it to the below  ``` if (from != address(0)) {     uint256 reqAmount = withdrawalReq[from].amount     if (reqAmount > 0){         uint256 _after = balanceOf(from) - amount;         if (_after < reqAmount) {             withdrawalReq[from].amount = _after;         }     }  } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As above
