# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas is overspent on state variables storage access.  ## Proof of Concept  getCollateral only reads state.reserves.asset, state.totalClaims.insurance and state.reserves.collateral up to 2 times each, and state.totalClaims.bond up to 4 times:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/libraries/WithdrawMath.sol#L26   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Save all four state variables to memory before running the logic.
