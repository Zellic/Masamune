# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Add an address check in receive() of Ladle.sol to ensure the only address sending ETH being received in receive() is the Weth9 contract (similar to the check in PoolRouter.sol) for Ether withdrawal in _exitEther().  This will prevent stray Ether from being sent accidentally to this contract and getting locked.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Ladle.sol#L521-L522  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/yieldspace/PoolRouter.sol#L145-L148   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add an address check in receive() of Ladle.sol to ensure only Weth9 contract can send Ether to this contract.
