# Handle  Ruhum   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The recent events concerning MIM showed that stablecoins are not always worth $1. It might be worth it to add an option to stop accepting a specific stablecoin for the time being in `FlanBackstop`.  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/magic-internet-money/  Generally, it would allow someone to mint `PyroFlan` for cheaper than expected. Whether there are more possible attack vectors is not entirely clear to me.  I'd argue that you don't lose much by adding it.  ## Proof of Concept Currently, a backer can only be updated through a proposal which will most likely take too long: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L63  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Allow pausing the use of specific backers. Using the `governanceApproved()` modifier might be good
