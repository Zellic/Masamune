While the value 0 is correctly handled for the royalties itself, it is not for the address. In such a case, the ETH amount will be sent to `address(0)`, i.e. it is burned and lost.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In your logic for determining the recipients, treat `address(0)` as if no recipient was returned such that the other priorities / methods take over.
