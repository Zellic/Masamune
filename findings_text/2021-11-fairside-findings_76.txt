# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `FSD.claimGovernanceTribute` function first performs the expensive `getPriorConvictionScore` instead of the cheap `isGovernance[msg.sender]` check.  ```solidity function claimGovernanceTribute(uint256 num) external {     require(         governanceThreshold <=             getPriorConvictionScore(                 msg.sender,                 governanceTributes[num].blockNumber             ) &&             // @audit gas: rearrange this to be first for short circuiting             isGovernance[msg.sender],         "FSD::claimGovernanceTribute: Not a governance member"     );     _claimGovernanceTribute(num); } ```  Reordering the conditions to first do the cheap governance check would allow this function to short-circuit if the user is not a governor, which will save gas on average. The last assignment `membership[msg.sender] = user;` is not required.
