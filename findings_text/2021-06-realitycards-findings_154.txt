# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `Factory.createMarket` iterates over all `_cardAffiliateAddresses`.  ## Impact  The transactions can fail if the arrays get too big and the transaction would consume more gas than the block limit. This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Perform a `_cardAffiliateAddresses.length == 0 || _cardAffiliateAddresses.length == tokenUris.length` check in `createMarket` instead of silently skipping card affiliate cuts in `Market.initialize`. This would restrict the `_cardAffiliateAddresses` length to the `nftMintingLimit` as well.
