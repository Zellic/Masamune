The non-deprecated criteria is unnecessary and lead to incorrect accounting of free weight.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/token/ERC20Gauges.sol#L547-L583 ```     function _decrementWeightUntilFree(address user, uint256 weight) internal {         uint256 userFreeWeight = balanceOf[user] - getUserWeight[user];          // early return if already free         if (userFreeWeight >= weight) return;          uint32 currentCycle = _getGaugeCycleEnd();          // cache totals for batch updates         uint112 userFreed;         uint112 totalFreed;          // Loop through all user gauges, live and deprecated         address[] memory gaugeList = _userGauges[user].values();          // Free gauges until through entire list or under weight         uint256 size = gaugeList.length;         for (uint256 i = 0; i < size && (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) < weight; ) {             address gauge = gaugeList[i];             uint112 userGaugeWeight = getUserGaugeWeight[user][gauge];             if (userGaugeWeight != 0) {                 // If the gauge is live (not deprecated), include its weight in the total to remove                 if (!_deprecatedGauges.contains(gauge)) {                     totalFreed += userGaugeWeight;                 }                 userFreed += userGaugeWeight;                 _decrementGaugeWeight(user, gauge, userGaugeWeight, currentCycle);                  unchecked {                     i++;                 }             }         }          getUserWeight[user] -= userFreed;         _writeGaugeWeight(_totalWeight, _subtract, totalFreed, currentCycle);     } ``` Consider Alice allocated 3 weight to gauge D, gauge A and gauge B equally where gauge D is depricated 1. Alice call _decrementWeightUntilFree(alice, 2) 2. userFreeWeight = 0 3. gauge D is freed, totalFreed = 0, userFreed = 1 4. (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) < weight, continue to free next gauge 5. gauge A is freed, totalFreed = 1, userFreed = 2 6. (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) < weight, continue to free next gauge 7. gauge B is freed, totalFreed = 2, userFreed = 3 8. All gauge is freed  Alternatively, Alice can 1. Alice call _decrementWeightUntilFree(alice, 1) 2. userFreeWeight = balanceOf[alice] - getUserWeight[alice] = 3 - 3 = 0 3. gauge D is freed, totalFreed = 0, userFreed = 1 4. (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) < weight, continue to free next gauge 5. gauge A is freed, totalFreed = 1, userFreed = 2 6. (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) >= weight, break 7. getUserWeight[alice] -= totalFreed 8. Alice call _decrementWeightUntilFree(alice, 2) 9. userFreeWeight = balanceOf[alice] - getUserWeight[alice] = 3 - 1 = 2 10. (userFreeWeight + totalFreed) >= weight, break 11. Only 2 gauge is freed  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps No need to treat deprecated gauge seperately
