In contrast to a buyout, where it does not make sense to initiate a buyout if all tokens are held (because there is a dedicated method for that), it does make sense to have a migration that all token holders join. Therefore, this case should be handled.  ## Proof Of Concept ```diff --- a/test/Migration.t.sol +++ b/test/Migration.t.sol @@ -238,7 +238,7 @@ contract MigrationTest is TestUtil {          // Bob joins the proposal          bob.migrationModule.join{value: 1 ether}(vault, 1, HALF_SUPPLY);          // Alice joins the proposal -        alice.migrationModule.join{value: 1 ether}(vault, 1, 1000); +        alice.migrationModule.join{value: 1 ether}(vault, 1, HALF_SUPPLY);           vm.warp(proposalPeriod + 1);          // bob calls commit to kickoff the buyout process ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In such a case, `redeem` can be used instead of starting a buyout.
