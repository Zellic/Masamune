# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Total supply depends on the decimals. I think it makes sense to express totalSupply something like this to make it more readable and maintainable in case you will decide to change decimals:      /// @notice EIP-20 token decimals for this token     uint8 public constant decimals = 8;      /// @notice Total number of tokens in circulation (100 million NOTE)     uint256 public constant totalSupply = 10_000_0000 * 10 ** decimals;
