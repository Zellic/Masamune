# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Detailed description of the impact of this finding.  ## Proof of Concept  The `Withdrawal` struct in `IndexTemplate.sol` contains a timestamp and the amount of tokens which the user requests to withdraw.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L81-L84  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L198  If we make the safe assumption that the user's balance does not exceed 2^192 then we can pack this struct into a single storage slot to save an SLOAD by changing the definition to:  ``` struct Withdrawal {     uint64 timestamp;     uint192 amount; } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As above
