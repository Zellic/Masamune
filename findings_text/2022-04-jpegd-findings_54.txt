There is no check for stale price and round completeness. Price can be stale and can lead to wrong  `answer`  return value.  ``` function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {         int256 answer = oracle.latestAnswer();         uint8 decimals = oracle.decimals();          require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");          ...  ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol#L105  ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Validate data feed  ``` function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {  (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();         require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");     require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");     require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");           ...  ```
