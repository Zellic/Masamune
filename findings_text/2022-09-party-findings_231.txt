On top of that, using a non standard hash can be unsafe. Since diverging from the standard can break things.    ## Impact   For the `FixedGovernanceOpts` an attacker can create a legitimate party, and then when running `buy()` use the malicious hash to: * include himself in the hosts (DoS-ing the party by vetoing every vote) * reduce the `passThresholdBps` (allowing him to pass any vote, including sending funds from the Party) * Setting himself as `feeRecipient` and increasing the fee   For the `DistributionInfo` struct - an attacker can easily drain all funds from the token distribution contract, by using the legitimate hash to create a distribution with a malicious ERC20 token (and a malicious party contract), and then using the malicious hash to claim assets of a legitimate token.  ## Proof of Concept  ### The attack   Using the birthday attack, for a 50% chance with a 15 bytes hash, the number of hashes needed to generate is 1.4e18 (`(ln(1/0.5) *2) ** 0.5 * (2 ** 60)`). * For 16 bytes that would be 2.2e19  An attacker can create 2 different structs, a legitimate and a malicious one, while modifying at each iteration only the last bits * For the `FixedGovernanceOpts` the last bits would be the `feeRecipient` field * For the `DistributionInfo` struct that would be the `fee` field (and then exploit it via the `claim()` function which doesn't validate the `fee` field)  The attacker will than generate half of the hashes from the malicious one, and half from the legitimate ones, so in case of a collision there's a 50% chance it'd be between the legitimate and malicious struct.    ### CPU  * In the `DistributionInfo` we have 224 bytes (and for `FixedGovernanceOpts` 192 bytes if we precalculate the hosts hash) * A computer needs about 11 cycles per byte * An avg home PC can do ~3e9 cycles per seconds * There are ~8.6e4 seconds a day * Putting it all together `1.4e18 * 11 * 224 / (3e9*8.6e4)` = ~1.3e8  * Note that we can further optimize it (by 10 times at least), since we're using the same input and only modifying the last bits every time (the `fee` field)  ### Storage 32 * 1.4e18 = ~4.5e19 bytes is needed, while an affordable drive can be 8TB=~8e12 bytes. That puts it about 5e6 times away from and affordable attack.   ### Overall Risk The calculations above are for basic equipment, an attacker can be spending more on equipment to get closer (I'd say you can easily multiply that by 100 for a medium size attacker + running the computations for more than one day) Combining that with the fact that a non-standard hash is used, and that in general hashes can have small vulnerabilities that lower a bit their strength - I'd argue it's not very safe to be ~1e4 (for a medium size attacker; ~1.5e5 for 16 bytes) away from a practical attack.    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the standard, 32-bytes, output of `keccak256()`
