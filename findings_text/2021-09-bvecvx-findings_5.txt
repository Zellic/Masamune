# Handle  tensors   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact We have previously seen that the harvest function can be exploited for almost all the tokens at stake. Since ManualRebalance calls harvest, it is also unsafe and funds swapped using it will likely be lost.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-bvecvx/blob/1d64bd58c7a4224cc330cef283561e90ae6a3cf5/veCVX/contracts/veCVXStrategy.sol#L444-L453  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Adding an amount out minimum here will work that should be passed on to the harvest method.
