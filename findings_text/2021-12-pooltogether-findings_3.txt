# Handle  johnnycash   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  An attacker can claim its reward 256 * `epochDuration` seconds after the timestamp at which the promotion started. The vulnerability allows him to claim a reward several times to retrieve all the tokens associated to the promotion.    ## Analysis  `claimRewards()` claim rewards for a given promotion and epoch. In order to prevent a user from claiming a reward multiple times, the mapping [_claimedEpochs](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/ceadb25844f95f19f33cb856222e461ed8edf005/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L32) keeps track of claimed rewards per user:  ```     /// @notice Keeps track of claimed rewards per user.     /// @dev _claimedEpochs[promotionId][user] => claimedEpochs     /// @dev We pack epochs claimed by a user into a uint256. So we can't store more than 255 epochs.     mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) internal _claimedEpochs; ```  (The comment is wrong, epochs are packed into a uint256 which allows **256** epochs to be stored).  `_epochIds` is an array of `uint256`. For each `_epochId` in this array, `claimRewards()` checks that the reward associated to this `_epochId` isn't already claimed thanks to  `_isClaimedEpoch()`. [_isClaimedEpoch()](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/ceadb25844f95f19f33cb856222e461ed8edf005/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L371) checks that the bit `_epochId` of `_claimedEpochs` is unset:  ``` (_userClaimedEpochs >> _epochId) & uint256(1) == 1; ```  However, if `_epochId` is greater than 255, `_isClaimedEpoch()` always returns false. It allows an attacker to claim a reward several times.  [_calculateRewardAmount()](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/ceadb25844f95f19f33cb856222e461ed8edf005/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L289) just makes use of `_epochId` to tell whether the promotion is over.   ## Proof of Concept  The following test should result in a reverted transaction, however the transaction succeeds.  ```         it('should fail to claim rewards if one or more epochs have already been claimed', async () => {             const promotionId = 1;              const wallet2Amount = toWei('750');             const wallet3Amount = toWei('250');              await ticket.mint(wallet2.address, wallet2Amount);             await ticket.mint(wallet3.address, wallet3Amount);              await createPromotion(ticket.address);             await increaseTime(epochDuration * 257);              await expect(                 twabRewards.claimRewards(wallet2.address, promotionId, ['256', '256']),             ).to.be.revertedWith('TwabRewards/rewards-already-claimed');         }); ```   ## Tools Used  Text editor.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  A possible fix could be to change the type of `_epochId` to `uint8` in:  - `_calculateRewardAmount()` - `_updateClaimedEpoch()` - `_isClaimedEpoch()`  and change the type of `_epochIds` to `uint8[]` in `claimRewards()`.
