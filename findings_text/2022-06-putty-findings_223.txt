If they're unable to perform the 'put', they've paid the premium for nothing, and essentially have had funds stolen from them.   ## Proof of Concept If the put option seller includes in `order.erc20Assets`, an amount of zero for any of the assets, or specifies an asset that doesn't currently have any code at its address, the put buyer will be unable to exercise the option, and will have paid the premium for nothing: ```solidity File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #1  453               // transfer assets from exerciser to putty 454               _transferERC20sIn(order.erc20Assets, msg.sender); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L453-L454   The function reverts if any amount is equal to zero, or the asset doesn't exist: ```solidity File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #2  593       function _transferERC20sIn(ERC20Asset[] memory assets, address from) internal { 594           for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) { 595               address token = assets[i].token; 596               uint256 tokenAmount = assets[i].tokenAmount; 597    598               require(token.code.length > 0, "ERC20: Token is not contract"); 599               require(tokenAmount > 0, "ERC20: Amount too small"); 600    601               ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), tokenAmount); 602           } 603       } ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L593-L603    ## Tools Used Code inspection   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Verify the asset amounts and addresses during `fillOrder()`, and allow exercise if the token no longer exists at that point in time
