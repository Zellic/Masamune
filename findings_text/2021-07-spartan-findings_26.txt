# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function depositForMember of BondVault.sol adds user to the array arrayMembers. However it does this for each asset that a user deposits. Suppose a user deposit multiple assets, than the user is added multiple times to the array arrayMembers.  This will mean the memberCount() doesn't show accurate results. Also allMembers() will contain duplicate members  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/main/contracts/BondVault.sol#L60 function depositForMember(address asset, address member, uint LPS) external onlyDAO returns(bool){         if(!mapBondAsset_memberDetails[asset].isMember[member]){             mapBondAsset_memberDetails[asset].isMember[member] = true; // Register user as member (scope: user -> asset)             arrayMembers.push(member); // Add user to member array (scope: vault)             mapBondAsset_memberDetails[asset].members.push(member); // Add user to member array (scope: user -> asset)         }        ...      // Get the total count of all existing & past BondVault members     function memberCount() external view returns (uint256 count){         return arrayMembers.length;     }     function allMembers() external view returns (address[] memory _allMembers){         return arrayMembers;     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use a construction like this: mapping(address => bool) isMember;    if(!isMember[member]){             isMember[member] = true;             arrayMembers.push(member);     }
