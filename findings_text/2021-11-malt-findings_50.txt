# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas is overspent on access and operations.  ## Proof of Concept  ```claimablePerc``` is calculated in two steps, which can be made simpler. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L294  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Now: ``` uint256 totalTokens = auction.commitments.mul(auction.pegPrice).div(auction.finalPrice); uint256 claimablePerc = auction.claimableTokens.mul(auction.pegPrice).div(totalTokens); ```  To be (```totalTokens``` isn't used elsewhere): ``` uint256 claimablePerc = auction.claimableTokens.mul(auction.finalPrice).div(auction.commitments); ```
