# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  User supplied values are not checked and can lead to unexpected behavior (such as division by 0, underflows...)  ## Impact I believe the high risk impact has been detailed and mitigated in other findings. However, for cleanliness and preventive measures, I suggest not allowing illogical inputs.  ## Proof of Concept There is no validation on the user supplied promotion inputs. [(Code ref)](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L88:#L116) Therefore for example, a user can supply _numberOfEpochs = 0, _epochDuration = 0, _tokensPerEpoch = 0. This leads to garbage values in the contract. A user can create a promotion without paying any tokens (if _numberOfEpochs or _tokensPerEpoch  = 0). These may confuse front ends, or compound to lead to more serious errors.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add sanity checks (such as inputs > 0) to `createPromotion` and `extendPromotion`.
