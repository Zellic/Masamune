Using this, a malicious user can re-enter the contract and re-fulfill the order using `takeOrders`.  ## Impact Orders can be executed twice. User funds would be lost.  ## Proof of Concept `matchOneToManyOrders` will set the order nonce as used only after the tokens are being sent: ```   function matchOneToManyOrders(OrderTypes.MakerOrder calldata makerOrder, OrderTypes.MakerOrder[] calldata manyMakerOrders) external {     ...     if (makerOrder.isSellOrder) {       for (uint256 i = 0; i < ordersLength; ) {         ...         _matchOneMakerSellToManyMakerBuys(...); // @audit will transfer tokens in here         ...       }       //@audit setting nonce to be used only here       isUserOrderNonceExecutedOrCancelled[makerOrder.signer][makerOrder.constraints[5]] = true;     } else {       for (uint256 i = 0; i < ordersLength; ) {         protocolFee += _matchOneMakerBuyToManyMakerSells(...); // @audit will transfer tokens in here         ...       }       //@audit setting nonce to be used only here       isUserOrderNonceExecutedOrCancelled[makerOrder.signer][makerOrder.constraints[5]] = true;       ...   } ```  So we can see that tokens are being transferred before nonce is being set to executed.  Therefore, POC for an attack - Alice wants to buy 2 unspecified WolfNFT, and she will pay via AMP, an ERC-777 token. Malicious user Bob will set up an offer to sell 2 WolfNFT. The MATCH_EXECUTOR will match the offers. Bob will set up a contract such that upon receiving of AMP, it will call [`takeOrders`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/main/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L336) with Alice's order, and 2 other WolfNFTs. (Note that although `takeOrders` is `nonReentrant`, `matchOneToManyOrders` is not, and so the reentrancy will succeed.)  So in `takeOrders`, the contract will match Alice's order with Bob's NFTs, and then set Alice's order's nonce to true, then `matchOneToManyOrders` execution will resume, and again will set Alice's order's nonce to true.  Alice ended up buying 4 WolfNFTs although she only signed an order for 2. Tough luck, Alice.  (Note: a similar attack can be constructed via ERC721's onERC721Received.)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Conform to CEI and set the nonce to true before executing external calls.
