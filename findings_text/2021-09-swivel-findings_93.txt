# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Interfaces are not allowed to define any functions while abstract contracts can have a few defined functions (with at least one undefined function). Abstract contracts declared in the project should really be interfaces because they do not define any functions.   Keeping them abstract is risky because they allow defining functions that may be mistakenly exposed in inherited contracts. Interfaces by design prevent this security risk.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/swivel/Abstracts.sol#L5-L40  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Convert contracts that do not define any functions to interfaces.
