# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The contract performs allowance checks for transfers in 2 ways:  1. Check allowance is greater than requested amount, revert otherwise. Then do allowance decrement. (Eg. in `transferFrom`) 2. Directly do the allowance decrement, will revert for underflow since sol 0.8.3 is used. (Eg. in `burnFrom`  It is best to stick to 1 method for consistency. For gas optimizations, the 2nd method is better, but the first provides more meaningful revert messages to aid debugging.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Commit to either method, not both.
