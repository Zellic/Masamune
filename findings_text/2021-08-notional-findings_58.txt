# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `GovernorAlpha` inherits from a vulnerable `TimelockController`. This `TimelockController` allows an `EXECUTOR` role to escalate privileges and also gain the proposer role. See details on [OZ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-fg47-3c2x-m2wr) and the [fix here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1). The bug is that `_executeBatch` checks if the proposal was scheduled only **after** the transactions have been executed. This allows inserting a call into the batch that schedules the batch itself, and the entire batch will succeed. As the custom `GovernorAlpha.executeProposal` function removed the original "queued state check" (`require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Queued`), the attack can be executed by anyone, even without the `EXEUCTOR_ROLE`.  ## POC 1. Create a proposal using `propose`. The calldata will be explained in the next step. (This can be done by anyone passing the min `proposalThreshold`) 2. Call `executeProposal(proposalId, ...)` such that the following calls are made:  ``` call-0: grantRole(TIME_LOCK_ADMIN, attackerContract) call-1: grantRole(EXECUTOR, attackerContract) call-2: grantRole(PROPOSER, attackerContract) call-3: updateDelay(0) // such that _afterCall "isOperationReady(id): timestamp[id] = block.timestamp + minDelay (0) <= block.timestamp" passes call-4: attackerContract.hello() // this calls timelock.schedule(args=[targets, values, datas, ...]) where args were previously already stored in contract. (this is necessary because id depends on this function's args and we may not be self-referential) // attackerContract is proposer & executor now and can directly call scheduleBatch & executeBatch without having to create a proposal ```  > ℹ️  I already talked to Jeff Wu about this and he created a test case for it confirming this finding  ## Impact Anyone who can create a proposal can become Timelock admin (proposer & executor) and execute arbitrary transactions as the DAO-controlled `GovernorAlpha`. Note that this contract has severe privileges and an attacker can now do anything that previously required approval of the DAO. For example, they could update the `globalTransferOperator` and steal all tokens.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We recommend updating the vulnerable contract to `TimelockController v3.4.2`. It currently uses `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.4.0-solc-0.7`
