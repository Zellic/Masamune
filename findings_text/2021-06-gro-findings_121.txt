# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `withdrawSingleByLiquidity` function of `LifeGuard3Pool` calls `buoy.singleStableToUsd` to calculate the return USD amount, which internally calls `_stableToUsd` with the `deposit` parameter set to `true`. A more accurate calculation is to set the `deposit` parameter to `false` since this action is a withdrawal. A similar issue exists in the function `calcProtocolWithdraw` of `Allocation`, where the current strategy's USD is calculated by `buoy.singleStableToUsd`.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L226](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L226) [Buoy3Pool.sol#L122](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/pools/oracle/Buoy3Pool.sol#L122) [Allocation.sol#L142](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/insurance/Allocation.sol#L142)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding a new boolean parameter, `deposit`, to the `singleStableToUsd` function of `Buoy3Pool` to indicate whether the action is a deposit or not, as that in the `stableToUsd` and `stableToLp` functions.
