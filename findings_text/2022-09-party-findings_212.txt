If the `receiver` input for the `transferEth` function corresponds to a contract, it is possible that the receiver contract does not, intentionally or unintentionally, implement the `receive` or `fallback` function in a way that supports receiving ETH or that calling the receiver contract's `receive` or `fallback` function executes complicated logics that cost much gas, which could cause calling `transferEth` to revert. For example, when calling `transferEth` reverts, calling `_burn` also reverts; this means that the receiver contract would not be able to get the voting power and receive the extra contribution it made after the crowdfunding finishes; yet, the receiver contract deserves these voting power and contribution refund. Hence, the receiver contract loses valuables that it deserves, which is unfair to the users who controls it.  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/main/contracts/utils/LibAddress.sol#L8-L15 ```solidity     function transferEth(address payable receiver, uint256 amount)         internal     {         (bool s, bytes memory r) = receiver.call{value: amount}("");         if (!s) {             revert EthTransferFailed(receiver, r);         }     } ```  https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/Crowdfund.sol#L444-L489 ```solidity     function _burn(address payable contributor, CrowdfundLifecycle lc, Party party_)         private     {         // If the CF has won, a party must have been created prior.         if (lc == CrowdfundLifecycle.Won) {             if (party_ == Party(payable(0))) {                 revert NoPartyError();             }         } else if (lc != CrowdfundLifecycle.Lost) {             // Otherwise it must have lost.             revert WrongLifecycleError(lc);         }         // Split recipient can burn even if they don't have a token.         if (contributor == splitRecipient) {             if (_splitRecipientHasBurned) {                 revert SplitRecipientAlreadyBurnedError();             }             _splitRecipientHasBurned = true;         }         // Revert if already burned or does not exist.         if (splitRecipient != contributor || _doesTokenExistFor(contributor)) {             CrowdfundNFT._burn(contributor);         }         // Compute the contributions used and owed to the contributor, along         // with the voting power they'll have in the governance stage.

This test will pass to demonstrate the described scenario.  ```solidity     error EthTransferFailed(address receiver, bytes errData);      function testContributorContractFailsToReceiveETH() public {         uint256 tokenId = erc721Vault.mint();         BuyCrowdfund pb = _createCrowdfund(tokenId, 0);          // This contract is used to simulate a contract that does not implement the receive or fallback function for the purpose of receiving ETH.         address payable contributorContract = payable(address(this));         vm.deal(contributorContract, 1e18);          address delegate = _randomAddress();          // contributorContract contributes 1e18.         vm.prank(contributorContract);         pb.contribute{ value: 1e18 }(delegate, "");          // The price of the NFT of interest is 0.5e18.         Party party_ = pb.buy(             payable(address(erc721Vault)),             0.5e18,             abi.encodeCall(erc721Vault.claim, (tokenId)),             defaultGovernanceOpts         );          // After calling the buy function, the party is created with the NFT.         assertEq(address(party), address(party_));         assertTrue(pb.getCrowdfundLifecycle() == Crowdfund.CrowdfundLifecycle.Won);         assertEq(pb.settledPrice(), 0.5e18);         assertEq(pb.totalContributions(), 1e18);         assertEq(address(pb).balance, 1e18 - 0.5e18);          // Calling the burn function reverts because contributorContract cannot receive ETH through the receive or fallback function         vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(             EthTransferFailed.selector,             contributorContract,             ""         ));         pb.burn(contributorContract);          // contributorContract does not receive 0.5e18 back from the BuyCrowdfund contract.         assertEq(contributorContract.balance, 0);     } ```  ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps When calling the `transferEth` function, if the receiver contract is unable to receive ETH through its `receive` or `fallback` function, WETH can be used to deposit the corresponding ETH amount, and the deposited amount can be transferred to the receiver contract.
