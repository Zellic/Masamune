# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  _token is conditionally set (to WBNB) but never used in addLiquiditySingleForMember() function unlike its usage in other functions. Such usage typically indicates missing/incorrect functionality. It looks like _handleTransferIn checks token == 0 again to consider BNB.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L83  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Recommend re-evaluating _token usage in this function, adding any missing logic or removing it for readability/maintainability.
