# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `UniswapV3Oracle.sol` is calling `latestAnswer` to get the last WETH price. This method will return the last value, but you won't be able to check if the data is fresh. On the other hand, calling the method `latestRoundData` allow you to run some extra validations  ```        (           roundId,           rawPrice,           ,           updateTime,           answeredInRound         ) = AggregatorV3Interface(XXXXX).latestRoundData();         require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");         require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");         require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price"); ```  More information:  https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round
