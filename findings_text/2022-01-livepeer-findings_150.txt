# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost (2 SLOADs and 1 SUB are avoided with the suggested solution)  ## Proof of Concept In `L2LPTDataCache.sol:l1CirculatingSupply()`, the code is as such: ``` File: L2LPTDataCache.sol 88:     function l1CirculatingSupply() public view returns (uint256) { 89:         // After the first update from L1, l1TotalSupply should always be >= l2SupplyFromL1 90:         // The below check is defensive to avoid reverting if this invariant for some reason violated 91:         return 92:             l1TotalSupply >= l2SupplyFromL1 93:                 ? l1TotalSupply - l2SupplyFromL1 94:                 : 0; 95:     }  ```  Here, in the case of `l1TotalSupply == l2SupplyFromL1`, the substraction is equal to 0, but the computation is still done instead of return the already present 0 value. This could be avoided by making a strict comparison: ``` File: L2LPTDataCache.sol 91:         return 92:             l1TotalSupply > l2SupplyFromL1 93:                 ? l1TotalSupply - l2SupplyFromL1 94:                 : 0; ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use `>` instead of `>=`
