Since anyone can transfer lp tokens to any user, a griefer can transfer 1 wei of lp tokens to another user to reset their `lastActionTimestamp` used in the withdrawal fee calculation.  The developers nicely weight the updated withdrawal fee by taking the original balance/original fee vs the added balance/added fee. The attacker will only be able to extend the runway of the withdrawal fee cooldown by resetting the `lastActionTimestamp` for future calculations. Example below:  ## Proof of Concept Assumptions: - MinWithdrawalFee = 0% //For easy math - MaxWithdrawalFee = 10% - timeToWait = 2 weeks  ### Steps - User A has `100 wei` of shares - User A waits 1 week (Current withdrawal fee = 5%) - User B deposits, receives `1 wei` of shares, current withdrawal fee = 10% - User B immediately transfers `1 wei` of shares to User A  Based on the formula to calculated User A's new feeRatio:  ```         uint256 newFeeRatio = shareExisting.scaledMul(newCurrentFeeRatio) +             shareAdded.scaledMul(feeOnDeposit); ```  In reality, User A's withdrawal fee will only increase by a negligible amount since the shares added were very small in proportion to the original shares. We can assume user A's current withdrawal fee is still 5%.  The issue is that the function then reset's User A's `lastActionTimestamp` to the current time. This means that User A will have to wait the maximum 2 weeks for the withdrawal fee to reduce from 5% to 0%. Effectively the cooldown runway is the same length as the original runway length, so the decay down to 0% will take twice as long.  `meta.lastActionTimestamp = uint64(_getTime());`  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Instead of resetting `lastActionTimestamp` to the current time, scale it the same way the `feeRatio` is scaled. I understand that this would technically not be the timestamp of the last action, so the variable would probably need to be renamed.
