# Handle  Tomio   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There is unnecessary if else condition on _redeemAndTransfer(), and can be optimized by removing the inline if else condition on line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/TreasuryAction.sol#L137-L140  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/TreasuryAction.sol#L137-L140  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps From: ```     if (underlying.tokenAddress == address(0)) {             WETH9(WETH).deposit{value: address(this).balance}();         }          address underlyingAddress = underlying.tokenAddress == address(0)             ? address(WETH)             : underlying.tokenAddress;         IERC20(underlyingAddress).safeTransfer(treasuryManagerContract, redeemedExternalUnderlying); ```  To: ```     if (underlying.tokenAddress == address(0)) {             WETH9(WETH).deposit{value: address(this).balance}();             IERC20(WETH).safeTransfer(treasuryManagerContract, redeemedExternalUnderlying);         }else{             IERC20(underlying.tokenAddress).safeTransfer(treasuryManagerContract, redeemedExternalUnderlying);         } ```
