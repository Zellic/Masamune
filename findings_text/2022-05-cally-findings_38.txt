I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:  - [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()`, use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible - Given that any NFT can be used for the call option, there are a few NFTs (here’s an [example](https://github.com/sz-piotr/eth-card-game/blob/master/src/ethereum/contracts/ERC721Market.sol#L20-L31)) that have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Call the `safeTransferFrom()` method instead of `transferFrom()` for NFT transfers. Note that the `CallyNft` contract should inherit the `ERC721TokenReceiver` contract as a consequence.  ```solidity abstract contract CallyNft is ERC721("Cally", "CALL"), ERC721TokenReceiver {...} ```
