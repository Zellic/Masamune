# Handle  ScopeLift   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There are four functions that can have stricter function mutability declarations. Using a stricter declaration can help the compiler save gas when it knows whether reads and writes will occur in a function  ## Proof of Concept  N/A  ## Tools Used  solc  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement the changes suggested by the Solidity compiler. For examples like `AbstractTransferVerification`, the solidity compiler is wrong because it doesn't know you plan to override this function declaration. Instead, `AbstractTransferVerification` could be an interface without a function definition  ``` contracts/AbstractTransferVerification.sol:9:3: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure   function verifyTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public view virtual returns (bool, string memory) {   ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).  contracts/AuctionEscapeHatch.sol:168:3: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to view   function _calculateMaltRequiredForExit(uint256 _auctionId, uint256 amount) internal returns(uint256) {   ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).  contracts/AuctionParticipant.sol:127:3: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure   function _handleRewardDistribution(uint256 rewarded) virtual internal {   ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).  contracts/MaltDataLab.sol:202:3: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure   function _normalizedPrice(   ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines). ```
