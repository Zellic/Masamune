# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  In `MochiProfileV0.sol`, `secPerYear` is defined as an immutable variable while it's not configured as a parameter of the constructor. Thus, it can be declared as constant to save gas.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/profile/MochiProfileV0.sol#L23-L28  ```solidity=23 uint256 public immutable secPerYear;  uint256 public override delay;  constructor(address _engine) {     secPerYear = 31536000; ```  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity=23 uint256 public constant SEC_PER_YEAR = 31536000; ```
