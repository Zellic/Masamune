If there are not enough claimable votes to meet that threshold then the party is softlocked because it can't pass any proposals. An attacker could exploit this to DOS even a private party with the following steps:  1. Wait for party to be filled to just under quorum threshold 2. Donate ETH to the crowdfund contract 3. Call BuyCrowdFund.sol#buy. Since it is unpermissioned even for parties with a gatekeeper, the call won't revert  Since the voting power for the final amount of ETH cannot be claimed, the party is now softlocked. If emergencyExecuteDisabled is true then the party will be permanantly locked and the NFT would effectively be burned. If emergencyExecuteDisabled is false then users would have to wait for PartyDAO to reclaim the NFT.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Permission to call BuyCrowdFund.sol#buy should be gated if there is a gatekeeper
