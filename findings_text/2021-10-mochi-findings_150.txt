# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact This not only loses some precision (cuz of multiplication and division) but also consumes more gas:     // send Mochi to vMochi Vault     mochi.transfer(         address(engine.vMochi()),         (mochiBalance * vMochiRatio) / 1e18     );     // send Mochi to veCRV Holders     mochi.transfer(         crvVoterRewardPool,         (mochiBalance * (1e18 - vMochiRatio)) / 1e18     );  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Proposed improvement:   // send Mochi to vMochi Vault   uint toVault = (mochiBalance * vMochiRatio) / 1e18;   mochi.transfer(       address(engine.vMochi()),       toVault   );   // send Mochi to veCRV Holders   mochi.transfer(       crvVoterRewardPool,       mochiBalance - toVault;   );  This way you the whole mochiBalance will be transferred and it will cost less to do that as fewer math operations are performed.
