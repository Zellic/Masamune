# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost (2 SLOADs and 1 SUB vs 1 MSTORE and 2 MLOADs)  ## Proof of Concept In `DelegatorPool.sol:claim()`, the following calculation is done twice :  ``` (X * _stake) / (initialStake - claimedInitialStake);  where X is either currTotalStake or currTotalFees ```  While I understand a loss of precision could occur by caching the whole calculation, it's possible to save some gas (here, 2 SLOADs and 1 SUB) by caching the result of the denominator's substraction in a variable (`initialStake - claimedInitialStake`) and using this instead of computing the substraction twice.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Apply the refacto
