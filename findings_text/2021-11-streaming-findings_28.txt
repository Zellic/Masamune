# Handle  cyberboy   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Performing multiplication before division is generally better to avoid loss of precision because Solidity integer division might truncate  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L237-L238 globalStreamingSpeedPerSecond is later used for unstreamed for multiplication after performing division while calculation of globalStreamingSpeedPerSecond   ## Tools Used Slither   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The code can be optimized to use uint112((uint256(tdelta) * (uint256(unstreamed) * 10**6) / (endStream - lastUpdate) * 10**6 Or maybe just  (uint112((uint256(tdelta) * (uint256(unstreamed)) / (endStream - lastUpdate)
