# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function transferTokens of SavingsAccountUtil.sol sends the excess ETH to msg.sender, while a _from parameter is also present in the function. It seems more logical to send it to _from, like the similar function _transferTokens of Repayments.sol  Luckily in the current code the _from is always msg.sender so it doesn't pose a direct risk. However if the code is reused or forked it might lead to unexpected issues.  Note: transferTokens and _transferTokens are very similar so they could be integrated; they have to be checked carefully when doing this  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/e688bd6cd3df7fefa3be092529b4e2d013219625/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccountUtil.sol#L98-L127 ```JS function transferTokens(.... ,   address _from,   address _to ) {      ...        (bool success, ) = payable(address(msg.sender)).call{value: msg.value - _amount}(''); // uses msg.sender instead of _from // also uses - instead of sub  ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/e688bd6cd3df7fefa3be092529b4e2d013219625/contracts/Pool/Repayments.sol#L457-L473 ```JS     function _transferTokens(  address _from,  address _to,.... ) {        (bool refundSuccess, ) = payable(_from).call{value: msg.value.sub(_amount)}(''); ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In function transferTokens() change msg.sender to _from
