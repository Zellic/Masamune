Usually in Upgradeable contract, a initialize function is protected by the modifier  ```solidity  initializer ```  to make sure the contract can only be initialized once.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  1. The implementation contract is compromised,  2. The attacker reinitialize the BridgeEscrow contract  ```     function initialize(address _controller) external onlyImpl {         Managed._initialize(_controller);     } ```  the onlyGovernor modifier's result depends on the controller because  ```solidity     function _onlyGovernor() internal view {         require(msg.sender == controller.getGovernor(), "Caller must be Controller governor");     } ```  3. The attacker have the governor access to the BridgeEscrow,   4. The attack can call the approve function to approve malicious contract   ```solidity      function approveAll(address _spender) external onlyGovernor {         graphToken().approve(_spender, type(uint256).max);     } ```  5. The attack can drain all the GRT token from the BridgeEscrow.  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  We recommend the project use the modifier   ```solidity  initializer ```  to protect the initialize function from being reinitiated  ```solidity    function initialize(address _owner) external onlyImpl initializer  { ```
