# Handle  broccolirob   # Vulnerability details   A malicious "publisher" can create a basket proposal that mixes real ERC20 tokens with a malicious ERC20 token containing a reentrancy callback in it's `approve()` method. When the `initialize()` method is called on the newly cloned `Basket` contract, a method called `approveUnderlying(address(auction))` is called, which would trigger the reentrancy, call `initialize()` again, passing in altered critical values such as `auction` and `factory`, and then removes its self from `proposal.tokens` and `proposal.weights` so it doesn't appear in the token list to basket users.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-defiprotocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L44-L61  ## Impact `Auction` and `Factory` can be set to custom implementations that do malicious things. Since all baskets and auctions are clones with their own addresses, this fact would be difficult for users to detect. `Auction` controls ibRatio, which a malicious version could send back a manipulated value to `Basket`, allowing the malicious "publisher" to burn basket tokens till all users underlying tokens are drained.  ## Tools Used Manual review and Hardhat.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Since `Basket` inherits from `ERC20Upgradeable` the `initializer` modifier should be available and therefore used here. It has an `inititializing` variable that would prevent this kind of reentrancy attack.
