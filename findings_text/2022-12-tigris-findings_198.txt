Initiate a market order 2. Add margin 3. Add to position 4. initiate limit order  If USDT is set as the margin asset and protocol is deployed on ethereum.  (Note: this issue was submitted after consulting with the sponsor even though currently there are no plans to deploy the platform on ethereum)  ## Proof of Concept  `USDT` has a race condition protection mechanism on ethereum chain: It does not allow users to change the allowance without first changing the allowance to 0.   `approve` function in `USDT` on ethereum: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L205 ```     function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {          // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`         //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not         //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:         //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729         require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));          allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;         Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);     } ```  in `Trading` if users use `USDT` as margin to: 1. Initiate a market order 2. Add margin 3. Add to position 4. initiate limit order  The transaction will revert.   This is due to the the `_handleDeposit` which is called in all of the above uses.  `_handleDeposit` calls the `USDT` margin asset `approve` function with `type(uint).max`. From the second time `approve` will be called, the transaction will revert.  `_handleDeposit` in `Trading`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L652 ```     function _handleDeposit(address _tigAsset, address _marginAsset, uint256 _margin, address _stableVault , ERC20PermitData calldata _permitData, address _trader) internal { ------             IERC20(_marginAsset).transferFrom(_trader, address(this), _margin/_marginDecMultiplier);             IERC20(_marginAsset).approve(_stableVault, type(uint).max);             IStableVault(_stableVault).deposit(_marginAsset, _margin/_marginDecMultiplier); ------     } ```  ## Tools Used  VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  No need to to approve `USDT` every time.  The protocol could: 1. Keep a record if allowance was already set on an address 2. Create an external function that can be called by the owner to approve the a token address
