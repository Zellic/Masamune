# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  When factory changes `auctionMultiplier` or `auctionDecrement` profitability of bonded auctions change. There is no protection against this behaviour. Furthermore, factory owners can decide to get all tokens from baskets where they are bonded for the auction.  ## Proof of concept  1- Factory owners call `bondForRebalance` for an auction.  2- Factory owners sets `auctionMultiplier` as 0 and `auctionDecrement` as maximum value  3- `settleAuction` is called. `newRatio = 0`, since `a = b = 0`. All tokens can be withdrawn with this call, since `tokensNeeded = 0`.  ## Extra notes  Furthermore, even the factory owners does not try to scam users. In case `auctionMultiplier` or `auctionDecrement` is changed, all current `auctionBonder` from `Auctions` can only call `settleAuction` with different constraints. Because of different constraints, users/bonder will lose/gain funds.  ## Mitigation step  Save `auctionDecrement` and `auctionMultiplier` to global variables in `Auction.sol`, when `startAuction` is called.
