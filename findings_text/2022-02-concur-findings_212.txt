The `withdraw()` may often fail due to insufficient funds in the balance.  ### PoC  1. Alice deposits `4M` USDM and `4M` pool3 tokens; 2. Guardian calls `provide()` and all the `usdm` and `pool3` to `usdm3crv`; 3. Alice calls `withdraw()`, the tx will fail, due to insufficient balance.  ### Recommendation  Consider calling `usdm3crv.remove_liquidity_one_coin()`  when the balance is insufficient for the user's withdrawal.
