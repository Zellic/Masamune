Any excess funds paid for in excess of the premium will be transferred to the vault creator.  The premium is fixed at the time the vault is first created by `vault.premiumIndex`. Hence there is no need to allow users to overpay since there will be no benefit.   ## Proof of Concept  `buyOption()` allows `msg.value > premium`  ```solidity         uint256 premium = getPremium(vaultId);         require(msg.value >= premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent"); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider modifying the check such that the `msg.value` is exactly equal to the `premuim`. e.g.  ```solidity         uint256 premium = getPremium(vaultId);         require(msg.value == premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent"); ```
