The main concerns are with:  # Low issues  # hash collision with abi.encodePacked  ## IMPACT  strings and bytes are encoded with padding when using `abi.encodePacked`. This can lead to [hash collision](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) when passing the result to `keccak256`  ## SEVERITY  Low  ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  Instances include:  ### src/FERC1155.sol   ```cpp 394:             keccak256( 395:                 abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", _domainSeparator, _structHash) 396:             ); ```   ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis  ## MITIGATION  Use `abi.encode()` instead.   # Native `transfer` should be avoided  ## IMPACT   In `Migration`, the `.transfer()` method is used to transfer ETH.   The `transfer()` call requires that the recipient has a payable callback, only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:  - The contract does not have a payable callback - The contract’s payable callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something) - The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas  ## SEVERITY  Low  ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  Instances include:  ### src/modules/Migration.sol  ```cpp 172:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount); 325:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount); ```   ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis  ## MITIGATION  Use `.call()` to send ETH instead.  # Return value of ERC20.transferFrom unchecked  ## IMPACT   Some ERC20 implementations do not revert upon a fail `transfer/transferFrom` call, but return `false` instead. Not checking the return values of these calls can hence lead to silent failures of tokens transfers.  ## SEVERITY  Low  ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  Instances include:  ### src/modules/protoforms/BaseVault.sol  ```cpp 65:             IERC20(_tokens[i]).transferFrom(_from, _to, _amounts[i]); ```   ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis  ## MITIGATION  Check the return value of these calls to ensure they are not `0`  # Setters and constructors should check the input value  ## PROBLEM  Setters and constructors should check the input value for addresses - ie revert if `address(0)` is assigned to `address` variables.    ## SEVERITY  Low     ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  Instances include:   ### src/modules/protoforms/BaseVault.sol  ```cpp 24:     constructor(address _registry, address _supply) Minter(_supply) { 25:         registry = _registry; 26:     } ```  ### src/modules/Buyout.sol  ```cpp 42:     constructor( 43:         address _registry, 44:         address _supply, 45:         address _transfer 46:     ) { 47:         registry = _registry; 48:         supply = _supply; 49:         transfer = _transfer; 50:     } ```  ### src/modules/Migration.sol  ```cpp 58:         buyout = payable(_buyout); 59:         registry = _registry; ```  ### src/modules/Minter.sol  ```cpp 17:     constructor(address _supply) { 18:         supply = _supply; 19:     } ```  ### src/references/SupplyReference.sol  ```cpp 15:     constructor(address _registry) { 16:         registry = _registry; 17:     } ```  ### src/targets/Supply.sol  ```cpp 16:     constructor(address _registry) { 17:         registry = _registry; 18:     } ```  ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis    ## MITIGATION  Add non-zero checks   # Unused `receive()` functions  ## IMPACT   `Vault` and `Buyout` have an empty `receive()` function, but do not have any withdrawal function. Any ETH mistakenly sent to these contracts with empty `msg.data` would be locked.    ## SEVERITY  Low    ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  2 instances include:   ### src/Vault.sol  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/Vault.sol#L32 ```cpp 32:     receive() external payable {} ```  ### src/modules/Buyout.sol#L53  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L53 ```cpp 53:     receive() external payable {} ```   ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis    ## MITIGATION  Removes these functions or implement the appropriate logic in these empty blocks  # Non-critical issues  # Constants instead of magic numbers  ## PROBLEM  It is best practice to use constant variables rather than literal values (100, 1000, etc) to make the code easier to understand and maintain.  ## SEVERITY  Non-Critical  ## PROOF OF CONCEPT  7 instances include:  ### src/FERC1155.sol  ```cpp 247:         royaltyAmount = (_salePrice * royaltyPercent[_id]) / 100; ```  ### src/modules/Buyout.sol  ```cpp 86:         uint256 buyoutPrice = (msg.value * 100) / 87:             (100 - ((depositAmount * 100) / totalSupply)); ```  ```cpp 208:         if ( 209:             (tokenBalance * 1000) / 210:                 IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(_vault) > 211:             500 212:         ) ```  ### src/modules/Migration.sol  ```cpp 198:         uint256 currentPrice = _calculateTotal( 199:             100, 200:             IVaultRegistry(registry).totalSupply(_vault), 201:             proposal.totalEth, 202:             proposal.totalFractions 203:         ) ```  ## TOOLS USED  Manual Analysis  ## MITIGATION  Define constant variables for the literal values aforementioned.   # Events indexing  ## PROBLEM  Events should use the maximum amount of indexed fields: up to three parameters.
