# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L141   # Vulnerability details  The `leave` function allows to leave a proposal even if the proposal has been committed and failed. This makes it a (probably unintended) duplicate functionality of `withdrawContributions`, which is the function that should be used to withdraw failed contributions.  ## Impact User assets might be lost: When withdrawing assets from a failed migration, users should get back a different amount of assets, according to the buyout auction result. (I detailed this in another issue - "Migration::withdrawContribution falsely assumes that user should get exactly his original contribution back"). But when withdrawing assets from a proposal that has not been committed, users should get back their original amount of assets, as that has not changed. Therefore, if `leave` does not check if the proposal has been committed, users could call `leave` instead of `withdrawContribution` and get back a different amounts of assets than they deserve, on the expense of other users.  ## Proof of Concept The `leave` function [does not check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/main/src/modules/Migration.sol#L141) anywhere whether `proposal.isCommited == true`. Therefore, if a user calls it after a proposal has been committed and failed, it will continue to send him his original contribution back, instead of sending him the adjusted amount that has been returned from Buyout.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Revert in `leave` if `proposal.isCommited == true`. You might be also able to merge the functionality of `leave` and `withdrawContribution`, but that depends on how you will implement the fix for `withdrawContribution`.
