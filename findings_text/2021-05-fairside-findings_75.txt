# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The variable `fShareRatio` in the function `purchaseMembership` of contract `FSDNetwork` is vulnerable to manipulation by flash minting and burning, which could affect several critical logics, such as the check of enough capital in the pool (line 139-142) and the staking rewards (line 179-182).  ## Proof of Concept  The `fShareRatio` is calculated (line 136) by:  ```solidity (fsd.getReserveBalance() - totalOpenRequests).mul(1 ether) / fShare; ```  where `fsd.getReserveBalance()` can be significantly increased by a user minting a large amount of FSD tokens with flash loans. In that case, the increased `fShareRatio` could affect the function `purchaseMembership` results. For example, the user could purchase the membership even if the `fShareRatio` is < 100% previously, or the user could earn more staking rewards than before to reduce the membership fees. Although performing flash minting and burning might not be profitable overall since a 3.5% tribute fee is required when burning FSD tokens, it is still important to be aware of the possible manipulation of `fShareRatio`.
