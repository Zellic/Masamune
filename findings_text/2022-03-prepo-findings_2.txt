# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-prepo/blob/main/contracts/core/PrePOMarketFactory.sol#L42   # Vulnerability details  ## Impacted Function: createMarket  ## Description:  1. Owner calls createMarket with  _tokenNameSuffix S1 and _tokenSymbolSuffix S2 which creates a new market M1 with _deployedMarkets[_salt] pointing to M1. Here salt can be S which is computed using  _tokenNameSuffix and _tokenSymbolSuffix 2. This market is now being used 3. After some time owner again mistakenly calls createMarket with  _tokenNameSuffix S1 and _tokenSymbolSuffix S2  4. Instead of returning error mentioning that this name and symbol already exists, new market gets created. The problem here is that salt which is computed using _tokenNameSuffix and _tokenSymbolSuffix will again come as S (as in step 1) which means _deployedMarkets[_salt] will now get updated to M2. This means reference to M1 is gone  ## Recommendation: Add below check:  ``` require(_deployedMarkets[_salt]==address(0), "Market already exists"); ```
