# Handle  palina   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The Nestedbuybacker::triggerForToken() function does not check the return value of the `ExchangeHelpers.fillQuote(_sellToken, _swapTarget, _swapCallData);` call, which returns a boolean. Even if the swap in the fillQuote() is not successful and no NST was bought, the function proceeds with the trigger() function execution. trigger() also does not check if the `balance` variable (indicating the amount of NST bought) is positive, although there is (at best) no point in executing the rest of the function if there's no NST in the contract.  ## Proof of Concept Unchecked result of the fillQuote() call: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedBuybacker.sol#L101 Missing validation in trigger(): https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedBuybacker.sol#L108  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a return value check in the triggerForToken() function: `bool success = ExchangeHelpers.fillQuote(_sellToken, _swapTarget, _swapCallData); require(success);` and/or a `balance` value validation in trigger(): `uint256 balance = NST.balanceOf(address(this)); require(balance > 0);`
