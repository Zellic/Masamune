# Handle  robee   # Vulnerability details  Reading a storage variable is gas costly (SLOAD). In cases of multiple read of a storage variable in the same scope, caching the first read (i.e saving as a local variable) can save gas and decrease the  overall gas uses. The following is a list of functions and the storage variables that you read twice:           Liquidator.sol Variable _locked is read 2 times in the function:  liquidatePortion         MapleLoanInternals.sol Variable _drawableFunds is read 2 times in the function:  _closeLoan         MapleLoanInternals.sol Variable _refinanceCommitment is read 2 times in the function:  _acceptNewTerms         MapleLoanInternals.sol Variable _fundsAsset is read 3 times in the function:  _fundLoan         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable governor is read 2 times in the function:  setUp         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable globals is read 2 times in the function:  setUp         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable implementation1 is read 3 times in the function:  test_registerImplementation         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable initializerV1 is read 2 times in the function:  test_registerImplementation         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable factory is read 3 times in the function:  test_setDefaultVersion         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable implementation1 is read 2 times in the function:  test_setDefaultVersion         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable factory is read 4 times in the function:  test_createInstance         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable implementation1 is read 3 times in the function:  test_createInstance         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable factory is read 5 times in the function:  test_enableUpgradePath         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable factory is read 4 times in the function:  test_disableUpgradePath         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable factory is read 4 times in the function:  test_upgradeInstance         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable implementation1 is read 2 times in the function:  test_upgradeInstance         MapleProxyFactory.t.sol Variable implementation2 is read 2 times in the function:  test_upgradeInstance
