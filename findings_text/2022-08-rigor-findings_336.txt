It means that the project cannot be funded by either builder or community owner.  This can happen because `lendToProject()` used `projectCost()` function. And the loop in `projectCost()` did not have a mechanism to stop, it’s only based on the length `taskCount`, and may take all the gas limit. If the gas limit is reached, this transaction will fail or revert.  Same issue with `toggleLendingNeeded()` function which also call `projectCost()` function.  ## Proof of Concept  Function `projectCost()` did not have a mechanism to stop, only based on the `taskCount`. ```solidity function projectCost() public view override returns (uint256 _cost) {     // Local instance of taskCount. To save gas.     uint256 _length = taskCount;      // Iterate over all tasks to sum their cost     for (uint256 _taskID = 1; _taskID <= _length; _taskID++) {         _cost += tasks[_taskID].cost;     } } ```  There is no limit for builder when [add task](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L248-L257).  And function `lendToProject()` used `projectCost()` to [check the new total lent value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L199-L202) ```solidity require(     projectCost() >= uint256(_newTotalLent),     "Project::value>required" ); ```  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider keep value of `projectCost()` in a storage variable and update it when a task is added or updated accordingly.
