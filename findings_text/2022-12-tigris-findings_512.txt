As a result, the executed market order might be closed immediately and there would be an unexpected loss for users.  ## Proof of Concept As we can see from `executeLimitOrder()`, the open price might be changed to the current price for the stop order.  ```solidity File: 2022-12-tigris\contracts\Trading.sol 480:     function executeLimitOrder( 481:         uint _id,  482:         PriceData calldata _priceData, 483:         bytes calldata _signature 484:     )  485:         external 486:     { 487:         unchecked { 488:             _checkDelay(_id, true); 489:             tradingExtension._checkGas(); 490:             if (tradingExtension.paused()) revert TradingPaused(); 491:             require(block.timestamp >= limitDelay[_id]); 492:             IPosition.Trade memory trade = position.trades(_id); 493:             uint _fee = _handleOpenFees(trade.asset, trade.margin*trade.leverage/1e18, trade.trader, trade.tigAsset, true); 494:             (uint256 _price, uint256 _spread) = tradingExtension.getVerifiedPrice(trade.asset, _priceData, _signature, 0); 495:             if (trade.orderType == 0) revert("5"); 496:             if (_price > trade.price+trade.price*limitOrderPriceRange/DIVISION_CONSTANT || _price < trade.price-trade.price*limitOrderPriceRange/DIVISION_CONSTANT) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet 497:             if (trade.direction && trade.orderType == 1) { 498:                 if (trade.price < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet 499:             } else if (!trade.direction && trade.orderType == 1) { 500:                 if (trade.price > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet 501:             } else if (!trade.direction && trade.orderType == 2) { 502:                 if (trade.price < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet 503:                 trade.price = _price; 504:             } else { 505:                 if (trade.price > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet 506:                 trade.price = _price; //@audit check sl/tp 507:             }  508:             if(trade.direction) { 509:                 trade.price += trade.price * _spread / DIVISION_CONSTANT; 510:             } else { 511:                 trade.price -= trade.price * _spread / DIVISION_CONSTANT; 512:             }  ```  But it doesn't validate sl/tp again for the new price so the order might have an invalid sl/tp.  The new price wouldn't satisfy the sl/tp requirements when the price was changed much from the original price due to the high slippage and the order might be closed immediately by sl or tp in this case.  Originally, the protocol validates stoploss only but I say to validate both of stoploss and takeprofit. (I submitted it as another issue to validate tp as well as sl).  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend validating sl/tp for the new `trade.price` in `Trading.executeLimitOrder()`.
