# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In IndexTemplate, function compensate, When _amount > _value, and <= totalLiquidity(), the value of _compensated is not set, so it gets a default value of 0: ```solidity if (_value >= _amount) {     ...     _compensated = _amount; } else {     ...     if (totalLiquidity() < _amount) {         ...         _compensated = _value + _cds;     }     vault.offsetDebt(_compensated, msg.sender); } ```  But nevertheless, in both cases, it calls vault.offsetDebt, even when the _compensated is 0 (no else block).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think, in this case, it should try to redeem the premium (withdrawCredit?) to cover the whole amount, but I am not sure about the intentions as I didn't have enough time to understand this protocol in depth.
