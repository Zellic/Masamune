# Handle  Czar102   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Proper event declaration eases off-chain monitoring.  ## Proof of Concept  In the case of qualitative variables, it is recommended to use `indexed` keyword.  Despite the `uint duration` argument seems to be a quantitative one, it is limited to few values, which specify the "locking mode".  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  `uint duration` variable should be considered qualitative and be marked `indexed` in the following events: ``` event LockPeriodSet(uint256 duration, uint8 bonusMultiplier); event LockPositionCreated(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed owner, uint256 amount, uint256 duration); ```
