# Handle  axic   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Some major tokens went live before ERC20 was finalised, resulting in a discrepancy whether the transfer functions a) should return a boolean or b) revert/fail on error. The current best practice is that they should revert, but return “true” on success. However, not every token claiming ERC20-compatibility is doing this — some only return true/false; some revert, but do not return anything on success. This is a well known issue, heavily discussed since mid-2018.  Today many tools, including OpenZeppelin, offer a wrapper for “safe ERC20 transfer”: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol  RealityCards is not using such a wrapper, but instead tries to ensure successful transfers via the `balancedBooks` modifier:  ```     modifier balancedBooks {         _;         // using >= not == in case anyone sends tokens direct to contract         require(             erc20.balanceOf(address(this)) >=                 totalDeposits + marketBalance + totalMarketPots,             "Books are unbalanced!"         );     } ```  This modifier is present on most functions, but is missing on `topupMarketBalance`: ```     function topupMarketBalance(uint256 _amount) external override {         erc20.transferFrom(msgSender(), address(this), _amount);         if (_amount > marketBalanceDiscrepancy) {             marketBalanceDiscrepancy = 0;         } else {             marketBalanceDiscrepancy -= _amount;         }         marketBalance += _amount;     } ```  In the case an ERC20 token which is not reverting on failures is used, a malicious actor could call `topupMarketBalance` with a failing transfer, but also move the value of `marketBalance` above the actual holdings. After this, `deposit`, `withdrawDeposit`, `payRent`, `payout`, `sponsor`, etc. could be locked up and always failing with “Books are unbalanced”.  ## Proof of Concept  Anyone can call `topupMarketBalance` with some unrealistically large number, so that `marketBalance` does not overflow, but is above the actually helping balances. This is only possible if the underlying ERC20 used is not reverting on failures, but return “false” instead.  ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Use something like OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 2. Set up an allow list for tokens, which are knowingly safe 3. Consider a different approach to the `balancedBooks` modifier
