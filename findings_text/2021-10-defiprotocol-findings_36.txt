# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  There are many for loops that follows this for-each pattern: ``` for (uint256 i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {  // do something with `array[i]` } ```  In such for loops, the `array.length` is read on every iteration, instead of caching it once in a local variable and read it from there.  ## Impact Storage reads are much more expensive than reading local variables. Memory reads are a bit more expensive than reading local variables.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Read these values from storage / memory once, cache them in local variables and then read them again from the local variables. For example: ``` uint256 length = array.length; for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {  // do something with `array[i]` } ```
