# Handle  natus   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Here we return a value that isnt used anywhere which can safely be removed. This will save the return and also memory store gas costs  If the asset is not BNB/WBNB; we also get the startBal which is another memory store that isnt required, but more importantly we do a more expensive call to check the balance of the token in the pool contract which isnt required. This goes a step further at the 'actual' step at the end where we call the balance again and then do a MINUS math operation calling the memory value  Removing those lines will make all transactions cheaper that involve moving assets through the ROUTER, which appears to be quite a lot and sometimes even multiple times per function   ## Proof of Concept     ROUTER lines #197 to #211  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L197        ## Recommended Mitigation Steps     Remove these lines: #204 #206 #208  Also remove the return: returns(uint256 actual)
