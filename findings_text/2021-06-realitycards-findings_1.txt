# Handle  axic   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In `lib/NativeMetaTransactions.sol` there is a frequently used helper `msgSender`: ```     function msgSender() internal view returns (address payable sender) {         if (msg.sender == address(this)) {             bytes memory array = msg.data;             uint256 index = msg.data.length;             assembly {                 // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.                 sender := and(                     mload(add(array, index)),                     0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff                 )             }         } else { ... ```  Even though only the last 20-bytes matter, the `bytes memory array = msg.data;` line causes the *entire* calldata to be copied to memory. This is exaggerated by the fact, that if `msgSender()` is called multiple times in a transaction, the calldata will be also copied multiple times as memory is not freed.  ## Proof of Concept  N/A  ## Tools Used  Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are multiple ways to avoid this:  1. Make use of calldata slices and conversions  Something along the lines of (untested!): ```             // Copy last 20 bytes             bytes calldata data = msg.data[(msg.data.length - 20):];             sender = payable(address(uint160(bytes20(data)))); ```  2. Implementing purely in assembly  The OpenZeppelin implementation (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol#L21-L30) is an example of an optimised assembly version: ```             assembly {                 sender := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))             } ```  3. Combining slices and assembly  One must note that the pure assembly version is obviously the most gas efficient, at least today.
