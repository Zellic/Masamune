# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The access control model for the different contracts and how they interact is confusing and may cause issues during deployment and maintenance. Multiple contracts have the notion of admin(s), all of which use setAdmin function to update admin status. This mirroring and reuse of the admin variable is susceptible to accidents.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/MapleGlobals.sol#L20 https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/Pool.sol#L55 https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/PoolFactory.sol#L19 https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/Loan.sol#L58 https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/LoanFactory.sol#L27  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Rename the different admin variables e.g. adminGlobal, adminPool, adminLoan. Document the access control roles, hierarchy and interactions explicitly.
