# Handle  p4st13r4   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `totalAllocPoint` in `set()` function is read several times from storage. It can be assigned to a local variable so the function is less expensive overall  ## Proof of Concept  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L612](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L612)  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Assign `totalAllocPoint` to `localTotalAllocPoint` (or `cachedTotalAllocPoint`)
