# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Controller setWithdrawHandler() is missing a zero-address check and event parameter for _emergencyHandler which is the more critical (used rarely but in an emergency incident-response that is always time-critical ) of the two addresses.  Scenario: setWithdrawHandler() is accidentally called with _emergencyHandler = 0 address. Without a check or an event here, this error goes unnoticed (unless caught in the event from WithdrawHandler::setDependencies). There is an emergency triggered after which withdrawals are attempted via the emergencyHandler but they fail because of the zero address. The correct non-zero emergencyHandler has to be set again. Valuable time is lost and funds are lost.   ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L105-L110  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/WithdrawHandler.sol#L129  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/WithdrawHandler.sol#L158   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add zero-address check and event parameter for _emergencyHandler
