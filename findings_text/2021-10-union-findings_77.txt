# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  In the current implementation, `UToken.sol` does not inherit and comply with `IUToken.sol`. This is against the best practices and inconsistent with other contracts in the codebase that do inherit and comply with their interfaces.  For example, the `repay()` function defined in `IUToken.sol` is implementated as `repayBorrowBehalf()` and `repayBorrow()`.  It makes the `IUToken.sol` unable to be used and misleading.  ### Recommendation  Make `UToken.sol` inherits and complies with `IUToken.sol`.
