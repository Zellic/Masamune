# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  When a router adds liquidity to the `TransactionManager`, the manager does not correctly handle the received amount if the transferred token is a deflationary or fee-on-transfer token. The actual received amount is less than that is recorded in the `routerBalances` variable.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [TransactionManager.sol#L97](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-connext/blob/main/contracts/TransactionManager.sol#L97) [TransactionManager.sol#L101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-connext/blob/main/contracts/TransactionManager.sol#L101)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Get the received token amount by calculating the difference of token balance before and after the transfer, for example:  ```solidity uint256 balanceBefore = getOwnBalance(assetId); require(LibERC20.transferFrom(assetId, router, address(this), amount, "addLiquidity: ERC20_TRANSFER_FAILED"); uint256 receivedAmount = getOwnBalance(assetId) - balanceBefore;  // Update the router balances routerBalances[router][assetId] += receivedAmount; ```
