# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact For the enums Mode and State, checks are made that the variables are within bounds. Here specific size are used, e.g. 2 and 4. If the size of the enums would be changed in the future, those numbers don't change automatically. Also solidity provides in-built check to check that variables are within bounds, which could be used instead. This also make the code more readable.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L202 enum Mode {CLASSIC, WINNER_TAKES_ALL, SAFE_MODE} function initialize(      ...         assert(_mode <= 2);        // can be removed       ...          mode = Mode(_mode);  // this makes sure: 0<=mode<=2   // move to top  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IRCMarket.sol#L7     enum States {CLOSED, OPEN, LOCKED, WITHDRAW}  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L1094     function _incrementState() internal {         assert(uint256(state) < 4);                 // can be removed         state = States(uint256(state) + (1));  // this makes sure: 0<=state<=3         emit LogStateChange(uint256(state));     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps For function initialize: Remove the "assert(_mode <= 2);" and move the statement "mode = Mode(_mode);" to the top of the function and add a comment  For function _incrementState:  Remove "assert(uint256(state) < 4);" and add a comment at "state = States(uint256(state) + (1));"
