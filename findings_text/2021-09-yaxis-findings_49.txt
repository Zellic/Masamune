# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Events that are declared but not used may be indicative of unused declarations where it makes sense to remove them for better readability/maintainability/auditability, or worse indicative of a missing emit which is bad for monitoring or missing logic that would have emitted that event.  Event InsuranceClaimed is missing an emit.  Event ControllerSet is missing an emit.  Event VaultManagerSet is missing an emit.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L56  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/Harvester.sol#L44  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/Harvester.sol#L72  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add emit or remove event declaration.
