Ref: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics  While in `UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol`, subtraction overflow is desired at `blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast` in `currentCumulativePrices()`:  https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol#L25-L33  ```solidity if (blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {     // subtraction overflow is desired     uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;     // addition overflow is desired     // counterfactual     price0Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve1, reserve0)._x) * timeElapsed;     // counterfactual     price1Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve0, reserve1)._x) * timeElapsed; } ```  In another word, `Uniswap/v2-periphery/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2OracleLibrary` only works at solidity < `0.8.0`.  As a result, when `price0Cumulative` or `price1Cumulative` is big enough, `currentCumulativePrices` will revert due to overflow.  ### Impact  Since the overflow is desired in the original version, and it's broken because of using Solidity version >0.8. The `UniswapV2PriceOracle` contract will break when the desired overflow happens, and further breaks other parts of the system that relies on `UniswapV2PriceOracle`.  ### Recommendation  Note: this recommended fix requires a fork of the library contract provided by Uniswap.  Change to:  ```solidity if (blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {     unchecked {         // subtraction overflow is desired         uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;         // addition overflow is desired         // counterfactual         price0Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve1, reserve0)._x) * timeElapsed;         // counterfactual         price1Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve0, reserve1)._x) * timeElapsed;     } } ```
