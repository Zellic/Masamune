# Handle  jah   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact the initialize function will not be called from the contract and  it  doesn't require public visibility so the visibility should be changed to external to save gas as  described in https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/: “For all the public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically, and it costs gas. If your function is only called externally, then you should explicitly mark it as external. External function’s parameters are not copied into memory but are read from calldata directly. This small optimization in your solidity code can save you a lot of gas when the function input parameters are huge.”     ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L36  ## Tools Used manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps change the visibility to external
