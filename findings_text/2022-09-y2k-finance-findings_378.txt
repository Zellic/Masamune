Because it uses division before multiplication, it is possible that `entitledAmount` is calculated to be 0. As the `withdraw` function shows below, when `entitledAmount` is 0, the receiver and treasury both receive 0. As a result, calling `withdraw` with a positive `assets` input can still result in transferring nothing to the receiver and treasury.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L378-L426 ```solidity     function beforeWithdraw(uint256 id, uint256 amount)         public         view         returns (uint256 entitledAmount)     {         // in case the risk wins aka no depeg event         // risk users can withdraw the hedge (that is paid by the hedge buyers) and risk; withdraw = (risk + hedge)         // hedge pay for each hedge seller = ( risk / tvl before the hedge payouts ) * tvl in hedge pool         // in case there is a depeg event, the risk users can only withdraw the hedge         if (             keccak256(abi.encodePacked(symbol)) ==             keccak256(abi.encodePacked("rY2K"))         ) {             if (!idDepegged[id]) {                 //depeg event did not happen                 /*                 entitledAmount =                     (amount / idFinalTVL[id]) *                     idClaimTVL[id] +                     amount;                 */                 entitledAmount =                     amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(                         idClaimTVL[id],                         1 ether                     ) +                     amount;             } else {                 //depeg event did happen                 entitledAmount = amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(                     idClaimTVL[id],                     1 ether                 );             }         }         // in case the hedge wins aka depegging         // hedge users pay the hedge to risk users anyway,         // hedge guy can withdraw risk (that is transfered from the risk pool),         // withdraw = % tvl that hedge buyer owns         // otherwise hedge users cannot withdraw any Eth         else {             entitledAmount = amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(                 idClaimTVL[id],                 1 ether             );         }          return entitledAmount;     } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L203-L234 ```solidity     function withdraw(         uint256 id,         uint256 assets,         address receiver,         address owner     )         external         override         epochHasEnded(id)         marketExists(id)         returns (uint256 shares)     {         if(             msg.sender != owner &&             isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver) == false)             revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, owner);          shares = previewWithdraw(id, assets); // No need to check for rounding error, previewWithdraw rounds up.          uint256 entitledShares = beforeWithdraw(id, shares);         _burn(owner, id, shares);          //Taking fee from the amount         uint256 feeValue = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(entitledShares, id);         entitledShares = entitledShares - feeValue;         asset.transfer(treasury, feeValue);          emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, id, assets, entitledShares);         asset.transfer(receiver, entitledShares);          return entitledShares;     } ```  ## Proof of Concept Please append the following test in `test\AssertTest.t.sol`.
