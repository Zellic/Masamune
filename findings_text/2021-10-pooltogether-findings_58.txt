# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `_canAwardExternal()` function is used to prevent the `onlyPrizeStrategy` role from moving a yield source's deposit tokens. However, the `YieldSourcePrizePool.sol` contract only restricts the movement of tokens from the `yieldSource` address instead of the actual deposit token. As a result, the `onlyOwner` role could escalate its role by calling `PrizePool.setPrizeStrategy()` and setting the prize strategy to its own address. Once it has taken over this role, they could effectively transfer out the yield source's deposit tokens, thereby draining the contract.   This is in direct contrast to PoolTogether's ethos, whereby their docs state that the multisig account used to represent the `onlyOwner` role has no custody over deposited assets.  ## Proof of Concept  https://v4.docs.pooltogether.com/protocol/reference/launch-architecture#progressive-decentralization https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-pool/YieldSourcePrizePool.sol#L55-L57 https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-pool/PrizePool.sol#L329-L343 https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-pool/PrizePool.sol#L228-L236 https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-pool/PrizePool.sol#L300-L302  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider updating the `YieldSourcePrizePool._canAwardExternal()` function to restrict the prize strategy from withdrawing `yieldSource.depositToken()` instead.
