# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function circuitBreaker calls _incrementState but later sets the state itself again:     function _incrementState() internal {         assert(uint256(state) < 4);         state = States(uint256(state) + (1));         emit LogStateChange(uint256(state));     }      function circuitBreaker() external {         require(             block.timestamp > (uint256(oracleResolutionTime) + (12 weeks)),             "Too early"         );         _incrementState();         orderbook.closeMarket();         state = States.WITHDRAW;     }  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps state = States.WITHDRAW; shouldn't be there, or another solution would be to put it before orderbook.closeMarket(); and remove _incrementState(); instead but then LogStateChange event will also need to be emitted manually.
