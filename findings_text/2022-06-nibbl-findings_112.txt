In this case, this function will return 0 which is different from the correct value and it will affect the main functions like NibblVault.buy() and NibblVault.sell().  ## Proof of Concept I think this condition is to confirm at least 4 values were saved for twav calculation. Btw this timestamp would be zero even though there are more than 4 values properly as it's modularized by 2**32. In this case, the if condition will be false and this function will return 0.  ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I see "cumulativeValuation" is increasing all the time and recommend replacing "timestamp" with "cumulativeValuation". ``` if (twavObservations[TWAV_BLOCK_NUMBERS - 1].cumulativeValuation != 0) { ```
