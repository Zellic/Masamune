# Lines of code  https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/b93e2867a64b420ce6ce317f01c7834a7b6b17ca/contracts/Note.sol#L13-L31   # Vulnerability details  ```solidity function _mint_to_Accountant(address accountantDelegator) external {     if (accountant == address(0)) {         _setAccountantAddress(msg.sender);     }     require(msg.sender == accountant, "Note::_mint_to_Accountant: ");     _mint(msg.sender, type(uint).max); }  function RetAccountant() public view returns(address) {     return accountant; }  function _setAccountantAddress(address accountant_) internal {     if(accountant != address(0)) {         require(msg.sender == admin, "Note::_setAccountantAddress: Only admin may call this function");     }     accountant = accountant_;     admin = accountant; } ```  `_mint_to_Accountant()` calls `_setAccountantAddress()` when `accountant == address(0)`, which will always be the case when `_mint_to_Accountant()` is called for the first time.  And `_setAccountantAddress()` only checks if `msg.sender == admin` when `accountant != address(0)` which will always be `false`, therefore the access control is not working.  L17 will then check if `msg.sender == accountant`, now it will always be the case, because at L29, `accountant` was set to `msg.sender`.
