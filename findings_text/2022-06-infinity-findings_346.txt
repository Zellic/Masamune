Both require `currency` to be fixed for the call and can have it either as a ERC20 token or ETH. This way, the probability of a user sending over a ETH with the call whose `currency` is a ERC20 token isn't negligible. However, in this case ETH funds of a user will be permanently lost.  Setting the severity to medium as this is permanent fund freeze scenario conditional on a user mistake, which probability can be deemed high enough as the same functions are used for ETH and ERC20 orders.  ## Proof of Concept  Both takeOrders() and takeMultipleOneOrders() only check that ETH funds are enough to cover the order's `totalPrice`:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/765376fa238bbccd8b1e2e12897c91098c7e5ac6/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L323-L327  ```solidity     // check to ensure that for ETH orders, enough ETH is sent     // for non ETH orders, IERC20 safeTransferFrom will throw error if insufficient amount is sent     if (isMakerSeller && currency == address(0)) {       require(msg.value >= totalPrice, 'invalid total price');     } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/765376fa238bbccd8b1e2e12897c91098c7e5ac6/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L359-L363  ```solidity     // check to ensure that for ETH orders, enough ETH is sent     // for non ETH orders, IERC20 safeTransferFrom will throw error if insufficient amount is sent     if (isMakerSeller && currency == address(0)) {       require(msg.value >= totalPrice, 'invalid total price');     } ```  When `currency` is some ERC20 token, while `msg.value > 0`, the `msg.value` will be permanently frozen within the contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding the check for `msg.value` to be zero for the cases when it is not utilized:  ```solidity     // check to ensure that for ETH orders, enough ETH is sent     // for non ETH orders, IERC20 safeTransferFrom will throw error if insufficient amount is sent     if (isMakerSeller && currency == address(0)) {       require(msg.value >= totalPrice, 'invalid total price');     } else {       require(msg.value == 0, 'non-zero ETH value');     } ```
