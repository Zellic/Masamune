According to the doc in Inbox source code https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/1f32bec6b9b228bb2fab4bfa02867716f65d0c5c/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L427, function `createRetryableTicket` has one parameter called `callValueRefundAddress` and this is the address that is granted the option to `cancel` a `Retryable`. In `EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol` it's currently set as `msg.sender` (5th parameter) which is whoever make the call to  function `processCall`:  ``` uint256 _ticketID = inbox.createRetryableTicket{ value: msg.value }(       address(executor),       0,       _maxSubmissionCost,       msg.sender,       msg.sender,       _gasLimit,       _gasPriceBid,       _data     ); ``` This implementation allows an attacker to remove the possibility of a user to cancel their calls, which is an important mechanism to be properly implemented. This scenario demonstrates how this could happen: - User A call `relayCalls` to fingerprint their calls - User B call `processCalls` to process user A's calls. - User A now changes his mind and wants to cancel his calls but he's unable to since  `callValueRefundAddress` is set to user B's address, now user B is the one who decides whether to cancel user A's calls or not, which should be user A's option. - Another common case is when users's calls failed, anyone can try to `redeem` it, according to the doc https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging. So if a someone calls `processCalls` to process others's calls and it fails, the owner of the calls now cannot cancel their calls and anyone else can redeem (reexecute) them.  It should be noted here that `EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol` provides no other functionality to cancel users's calls, but it seems to rely only on Arbitrum's Retryable cancel mechanism to do so.   ## Tools Used Manual review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Currently, anyone can process others's calls by calling `processCalls` functions and I think this does not pose any security risk as long as the user who actually fingerprinted these calls can reserve their rights to cancel it if they want to. Therefore, I recommend changing `callValueRefundAddress` in `createRetryableTicket` to `_sender`, this combines with event `ProcessedCalls(_nonce, msg.sender, _ticketID)` emitted at the end of `processCalls` function will allow a user to be notified if their calls has been processed by anyone else and they can cancel it in L2 using `_ticketID`.
