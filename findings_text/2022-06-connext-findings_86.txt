# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/AssetFacet.sol#L100   # Vulnerability details  ## Issue  1. Admin can call setWrapper function to setup a new wrapper Y instead of old wrapper X  2. This becomes a problem for any old asset which was setup during setupAsset call where s.canonicalToAdopted[_canonical.id]  will still point to old wrapper X instead of Y  ## Recommendation If wrapper is changed then all variables storing this wrapper should also update
