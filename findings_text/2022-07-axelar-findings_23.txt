This will cause the unwrapping of those tokens to fail, as `unwrapped[wrappedToken]` will be `addres(0)`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Track how many wrapped tokens are in circulation, only allow the removal of a wrapped tokens when there are 0 to ensure for users that they will always be able to unwrap.
