By returning the startedAt of the last answer update, it's possible that this answer be considered "stale" from the protocol.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It's better to return the new `updatedAt_ ` at the greater of the two:   * `updatedAt_ ` from eth oracle,  * `updatedAt_ ` from the asset oracle  This way, if asset/eth is unchanged for a while, but there's a eth price move, we capture the correct `updatedAt` timestamp
