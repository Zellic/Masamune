# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Unlike SwappableYieldSource which uses safeIncreaseAllowance to increase the allowance to uint256.max, mStableYieldSource uses OpenZeppelin’s safeApprove() which has been documented as 1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and 2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance (current allowance == 0) or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise.  The usage here is intended to allow increase of allowance when it falls low similar to the documented usage in SwappableYieldSource. Using it for that scenario will not work as expected because it will always revert if current allowance is != 0. The initial allowance is already set as uint256.max in constructor. And once it gets reduced, it can never be increased using this function unless it is invoked when allowance is reduced completely to 0.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-mstable/blob/0bcbd363936fadf5830e9c48392415695896ddb5/contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol#L60-L65  https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-mstable/blob/0bcbd363936fadf5830e9c48392415695896ddb5/contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol#L51  https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L135-L143  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/081776bf5fae2122bfda8a86d5369496adfdf959/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol#L37-L57   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use logic similar to SwappableYieldSource instead of using safeApprove().
