# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  `BASE` is defined as an `address` type, but is casted as `iBEP20` in almost every instance within the Dao contract, and in numerous instances in many other contracts as well. It would therefore be better to define it as `iBEP20` instead, to avoid casting.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change `address public BASE;` to `iBEP public BASE`. Castings of `BASE` to `iBEP20` can be removed subsequently.
