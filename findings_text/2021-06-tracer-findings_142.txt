# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `recordTrade` function in `Pricing` updates the `currentHour` variable by 1 every hour. However, if there is no trade (i.e., the `recordTrade` is not called) during this hour, the `currentHour` is out of sync with the actual hour. As a result, the `averagePriceForPeriod` function uses the prices before 24 hours and causes errors on the average price.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Pricing.sol#L90-L94](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L90-L94)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Calculate how much time passed (e.g., `(block.timestamp - startLastHour) / 3600`) to update the `currentHour` variable correctly.
