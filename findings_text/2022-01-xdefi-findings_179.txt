# Handle  sirhashalot   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There is a require statement that contains the comment "Throw convenient error if trying to re-lock more than was unlocked. `amountUnlocked_ - lockAmount_` would have reverted below anyway." This comment is correct that the require statement is unnecessary and removing saves on gas during relock functions.  ## Proof of Concept  The unnecessary require statement is in the `relock()` and `relockBatch()` functions of XDEFIDistribution.sol: https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L115 https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L170  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the unnecessary require statement to save gas
