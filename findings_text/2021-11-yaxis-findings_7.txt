# Handle  TimmyToes   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The event emitted is for the updating of a different fee (the harvest fee). This could cause potential issues for any system wishing to integrate with yAxis and wishing to monitor changes to the system and potentially react to them. Such a system could record the wrong harvest  fee and would be unaware of updates to the borrow fee.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/Alchemist.sol#L299 Is the same as line 284  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Create a new event: event BorrowFeeUpdated(uint256 borrowfee); and call it on line 299 instead of HarvestFeeUpdated
