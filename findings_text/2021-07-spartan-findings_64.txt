# Handle  natus   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas optimization / non-critical issue. Wasted lines of code creating and setting a local variable that does not appear to be required. I can't think of a reason to leave it in.    ## Proof of Concept _token local variable is not used anywhere in the codebase. Can be removed to save gas and compile size. Looks like it's to handle WBNB (if it was required) but forgot to check/remove after it was catered for elsewhere. - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L83    ## Tools Used N/A    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps ROUTER.addLiquiditySingleForMember() - Remove line #82 - Remove line #83
