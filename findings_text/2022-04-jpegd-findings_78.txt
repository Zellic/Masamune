This means that the new debt interest rate is applied retroactively to the unaccrued period on next `accrue()` call.  It should never be applied retroactively to a previous time window as this is unfair & wrong. Borrowers can incur more debt than they should.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Call `accrue()` first in `setDebtInterestApr` before setting the new `settings.debtInterestApr`.
