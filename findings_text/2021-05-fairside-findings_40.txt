# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `TOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCORE` is supposed to track the sum of the credit scores of all governors.  In `ERC20ConvictionScore._updateConvictionScore`, when the user does not fulfill the governance criteria anymore and is therefore removed, the `governanceDelta` should be negative but it's positive.  ```solidity isGovernance[user] = false; governanceDelta = getPriorConvictionScore(     user,     block.number - 1 ); ```  It then gets added to the new total:  ```solidity uint224 totalGCSNew =     add224(         totalGCSOld,         governanceDelta,         "ERC20ConvictionScore::_updateConvictionTotals: conviction score amount overflows"     ); ```  ## Impact The `TOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCORE` tracks wrong data leading to issues throughout all contracts like wrong `FairSideDAO.totalVotes` data which can then be used for anyone to pass proposals in the worst case. Or `totalVotes` can be arbitrarily inflated and break the voting mechanism as no proposals can reach the quorum (percentage of `totalVotes`) anymore.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Return a negative, signed integer for this case and add it to the new total.
