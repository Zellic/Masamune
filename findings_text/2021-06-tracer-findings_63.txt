# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  withdrawFees() is an external function which can be called by anyone to transfer the accumulated fees to the feeReceiver account. However, there is no data validation to check if fees are non-zero.  Impact: One can keep calling withdrawFees(), even if the fees is zero, to grief the system with 0 amount transfers and emission of events recording the same. This leads to what is known as event log poisoning where malicious external users spam the Tracer contract to generate arbitrary FeeWithdrawn events.  ## Proof of Concept  See similar Finding from Sigma Prime’s audit of Synthetix Unipool: https://github.com/sigp/public-audits/blob/master/synthetix/unipool/review.pdf  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L508-L516  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding a require or if statement preventing the withdrawFees() function from emitting the event when the amount variable is zero, i.e. check if fees != 0 before transfer+emit.
