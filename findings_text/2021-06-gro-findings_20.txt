# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact calcProtocolExposureDelta should probably stop executing once it has found the first occurrence where exposure > threshold. (as is also indicated in the comment).  The current code also works (due to the check protocolExposedDeltaUsd == 0), however inserting a break statement at the end of the "if" is more logical and saves a bit of gas.  ## Proof of Concept //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/insurance/Allocation.sol#L286 ///     By defenition, only one protocol can exceed exposure in the current setup. ...  function calcProtocolExposureDelta(uint256[] memory protocolExposure, SystemState memory sysState) private pure        returns (uint256 protocolExposedDeltaUsd, uint256 protocolExposedIndex)     {         for (uint256 i = 0; i < protocolExposure.length; i++) {             // If the exposure is greater than the rebalance threshold...             if (protocolExposedDeltaUsd == 0 && protocolExposure[i] > sysState.rebalanceThreshold) {                 // ...Calculate the delta between exposure and target                 uint256 target = sysState.rebalanceThreshold.sub(sysState.targetBuffer);                 protocolExposedDeltaUsd = protocolExposure[i].sub(target).mul(sysState.totalCurrentAssetsUsd).div(                     PERCENTAGE_DECIMAL_FACTOR                 );                 protocolExposedIndex = i;                     // probably put a break here             }         }     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a break statement at the end of the if
