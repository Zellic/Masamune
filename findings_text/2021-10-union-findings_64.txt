# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `AssetManager.rebalance` function has a check at the end to ensure that all tokens are deposited again:  ```solidity require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0, "AssetManager: there are remaining funds in the fund pool"); ```  The idea is that the last market deposits all `remainingTokens` but the last market does not have to support the token in which case the transaction will fail, or the `percentages` parameter needs to be chosen to distribute all tokens before the last one (they need to add up to `1e4`). However, these percentages have a low precision as they are in base points, i.e, the lowest unit is `1 = 0.01%`. This will leave dust in the contract in most cases as the tokens have much higher precision.  ## POC Assume the last market does not support the token and thus `percentages` are chosen as `[5000, 5000]` to rebalance the first two markets. Withdrawing all tokens form the markets leads to a `tokenSupply = token.balanceOf(address(this)) = 10,001`:  Then the deposited amount is `amountToDeposit = (tokenSupply * percentages[i]) / 10000 = 10,001 * 5,000 / 10,000 = 5,000`. The two deposits will leave dust of `10,001 - 2 * 5,000 = 1` in the contract and the `token.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0` balance check will revert.  ## Impact Rebalancing will fail in most cases if the last market does not support the token due to precision errors.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the final zero balance check, or make sure that the last market that is actually deposited to receives all remaining tokens.
