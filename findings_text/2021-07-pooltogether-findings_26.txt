# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  Assuming that `depositToken` of a yield source doesn't change, it would make sense to save its value as a storage variable in the contract as well, so that an external call to `yieldSource` to retrieve it can be avoided whenever it is needed.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Define `address public override depositToken;` or `IERC20Upgradeable public depositToken;` which gets initialized in the `initialize()` function. The nice thing is that it also doesn't need to be updated when swapping sources because a requirement is that the new yield source must have the same deposit token.  As an optimization, since the `_requireYieldSource()` function already retrieves the `depositToken` address, it can return it so that its value need not be externally retrieved again in the `initialize()` function.  The `depositToken()` function can be removed if the former suggestion is implemented (ie. `address public override depositToken`).  Then, `yieldSource.depositToken()` can be replaced with `depositToken` where applicable (with appropriate casting).  A part of the former implementation is provided below.  ```jsx address public override depositToken;  function initialize(...) {  address depositTokenAddress = _requireYieldSource(_yieldSource);  yieldSource = _yieldSource;   depositToken = depositTokenAddress;  ...  IERC20Upgradeable(depositTokenAddress).safeApprove(address(_yieldSource), type(uint256).max); }  function _requireYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view returns (address depositTokenAddress) {  ...  (depositTokenAddress) = abi.decode(depositTokenAddressData, (address)); }  // function depositToken() can be removed // yieldSource.depositToken() can be replaced with depositToken in other functions // Example: _setYieldSource function _setYieldSource(IYieldSource _newYieldSource) internal {  _requireDifferentYieldSource(_newYieldSource);  // Commented out check below should be shifted to inside _requireDifferentYieldSource()  // Optimization: it can also return depositToken to avoid another SLOAD  // similar to _requireYieldSource() above  // require(_newYieldSource.depositToken() == depositToken, "SwappableYieldSource/different-deposit-token");    yieldSource = _newYieldSource;   IERC20Upgradeable(depositToken).safeApprove(address(_newYieldSource), type(uint256).max);    emit SwappableYieldSourceSet(_newYieldSource); } ```
