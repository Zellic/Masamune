# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Tokens are locked for 1 day less than specified in spec.  ## Proof of Concept  The vesting period is calculated here in `unixYear`  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/Vesting.sol#L30  This results in a lockup of 364 days rather than the expected 365.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace line with `uint256 constant private unixYear = 365 days;`
