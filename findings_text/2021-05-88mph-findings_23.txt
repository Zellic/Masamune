# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In contract `MPHMinter`, the function `distributeFundingRewards` does not check whether the contract itself is the owner of `mph`. If the contract is not the owner of `mph`, `mph.ownerMint` could revert, causing functions such as `withdraw`, `rolloverDeposit`, `payInterestToFunders` in the contract `DInterest` to revert as well.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [MPHMinter.sol#L121](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-88mph/blob/main/contracts/rewards/MPHMinter.sol#L121) [DInterest.sol#L1253](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-88mph/blob/main/contracts/DInterest.sol#L1253) [DInterest.sol#L1420](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-88mph/blob/main/contracts/DInterest.sol#L1420)  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a `mph.owner() != address(this)` check as in the other functions (e.g., `mintVested`).
