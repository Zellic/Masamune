The manager can use this flaw to get around the reserve balance by making a large deposit, taking a manager withdrawal, and then withdrawing their deposit.  ## Proof of Concept  Imagine a situation where the token has a balance of 100, deposits of 1000, and a reserve percentage of 10%. In this situation, the manager should not be able to make any withdrawal.  But, with the following series of events, they can: - Manager calls `deposit()` with 100 additional tokens - Manager calls `managerWithdraw()` to pull 100 tokens from the contract - Manager calls `withdraw()` to remove the 100 tokens they added  The result is that they are able to drain the balance of the contract all the way to zero, avoiding the intended restrictions.  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Include a check on the reserves in the `withdraw()` function as well as `managerWithdraw()`.
