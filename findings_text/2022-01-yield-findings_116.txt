# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L206-L224  ```solidity function _calcRewardIntegral(     uint256 _index,     address[2] memory _accounts,     uint256[2] memory _balances,     uint256 _supply,     bool _isClaim ) internal {     RewardType storage reward = rewards[_index];      uint256 rewardIntegral = reward.reward_integral;     uint256 rewardRemaining = reward.reward_remaining;      //get difference in balance and remaining rewards     //getReward is unguarded so we use reward_remaining to keep track of how much was actually claimed     uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.reward_token).balanceOf(address(this));     if (_supply > 0 && (bal - rewardRemaining) > 0) {         rewardIntegral = uint128(rewardIntegral) + uint128(((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply);         reward.reward_integral = uint128(rewardIntegral);     } ```  `reward.reward_integral` is `uint128`, if a early user mint (wrap) just `1` Wei of `convexToken`, and make `_supply == 1`, and then tranferring `5e18` of `reward_token` to the contract.  As a result, `reward.reward_integral` can exceed `type(uint128).max` and overflow, causing the rewards distribution to be disrupted.  ### Recommendation  Consider `wrap` a certain amount of initial totalSupply, e.g. `1e8`, and never burn it. And consider using uint256 instead of uint128 for `reward.reward_integral`. Also, consdier lower `1e20` down to `1e12`.
