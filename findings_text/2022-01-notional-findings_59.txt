# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas costs. ## Proof of Concept  In a number of places we create an array and then fill every element with zero. There's no need to do this as a newly declared array will have zero-valued elements by default. We can then avoid the costs of writing a new zero to them.  For example we could remove these three lines entirely: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L111-L113  We can then just pass an empty array in the lines below as so. ``` BALANCER_VAULT.exitPool(   NOTE_ETH_POOL_ID,   address(this),   payable(owner), // Owner will receive the NOTE and WETH   IVault.ExitPoolRequest(       assets,       new uint256[](2), // inlined here       abi.encode(           IVault.ExitKind.EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT,           bptExitAmount       ),       false // Don't use internal balances   ) ); ```  This also crops up elsewhere: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L156 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L169 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/d171cad9e86e0d02e0909eb66d4c24ab6ea6b982/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L185  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Omit lines writing zeros to an empty array.
