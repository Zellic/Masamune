# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Across the contracts, there are certain critical operations that change critical values that affect the users of the protocol.  It's a best practice for these setter functions to emit events to record these changes on-chain for off-chain monitors/tools/interfaces to register the updates and react if necessary.
