# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  1. `DEPLOYER` is set in the constructor but is not used anywhere in the contract 2. Redundant initialization `lastMonth = 0;` 3. `genesis` and `decimals` can have the `immutable` keywords since they are only set in the constructor and can't be changed 4. `iUTILS(_DAO().UTILS())` is called many times in `mintSynth()`, `removeForMember()` and `_swap*()` functions. Recommend storing as a local variable in these functions. 5. Since `revenueArray` cannot exceed length 2, the `addFee` function can be directly incorporated into the `addRevenue` function. Its for loop can be replaced with direct replacement of values. Also, `revenueArray.length != 2` is cleaner and easier to read compared to `!(revenueArray.length == 2)`. Given its purpose and usage, `archiveRevenue` / `cachePastRevenue` seems to be a better function name. If it is clear that revenueArray will be kept constant at 2, an alternative is to simply store the values as 2 separate variables.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Remove `DEPLOYER` 2. Remove the initialization `lastMonth = 0;` 3. `uint public immutable genesis;` and `uint8 public immutable override decimals;` 4. `iUTILS utils = _DAO().UTILS();` should utils be called more than once in a function 5. Possible implementation below  ```jsx function archiveRevenue(uint _totalRev) {  if (revenueArray.length == 2) {   // shift value to the right   revenueArray[1] = revenueArray[0];   revenueArray[0] = _totalRev;   } else {     // populate revenueArray to be of length 2     revenueArray.push(_totalRev);   } } ```
