# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  For the arithmetic operations that will never over/underflow, using the unchecked directive (Solidity v0.8 has default overflow/underflow checks) can save some gas from the unnecessary internal over/underflow checks.  For example:  https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/0e94c54774a6fce29daf9cb23353208f80de63eb/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L153-L153  ```solidity=153 uint256 _amount = _numberOfEpochs * _promotion.tokensPerEpoch; ```  `_numberOfEpochs` is uint8 `_promotion.tokensPerEpoch` is uint216  `_numberOfEpochs * _promotion.tokensPerEpoch` will never overflow.
