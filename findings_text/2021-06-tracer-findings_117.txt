# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The contract TracerPerpetualSwaps introduces these four state variables (lowestMaxLeverage,  maxLeverage, insurancePoolSwitchStage and deleveragingCliff) and four respective set functions. Logically the following relations are needed: lowestMaxLeverage < maxLeverage and insurancePoolSwitchStage < deleveragingCliff, but the code doesn't check for them.  Non-critical because needs an error by the owner.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L552 Also lines L560, L564, L568  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add appropriate requires to the set functions and the constructor.
