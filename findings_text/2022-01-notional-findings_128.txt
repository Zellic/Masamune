# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost due to unnecessary arithmetic operation  ## Proof of Concept See the @audit-info tag: ``` File: Bitmap.sol 46:     function getMSB(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256 msb) { 47:         // If x == 0 then there is no MSB and this method will return zero. That would 48:         // be the same as the return value when x == 1 (MSB is zero indexed), so instead 49:         // we have this require here to ensure that the values don't get mixed up. 50:         require(x != 0); // dev: get msb zero value 51:         if (x >= 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) { 52:             x >>= 128; 53:             msb += 128; //@audit-info this one and only can be replaced with =  54:         } 55:         if (x >= 0x10000000000000000) { 56:             x >>= 64; 57:             msb += 64; 58:         } 59:         if (x >= 0x100000000) { 60:             x >>= 32; 61:             msb += 32; 62:         } 63:         if (x >= 0x10000) { 64:             x >>= 16; 65:             msb += 16; 66:         } 67:         if (x >= 0x100) { 68:             x >>= 8; 69:             msb += 8; 70:         } 71:         if (x >= 0x10) { 72:             x >>= 4; 73:             msb += 4; 74:         } 75:         if (x >= 0x4) { 76:             x >>= 2; 77:             msb += 2; 78:         } 79:         if (x >= 0x2) msb += 1; // No need to shift xc anymore 80:     } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps On line 53, and only there, it is absolutely certain that `+=` can be replaced with `=`, which would look like this: ``` 53:             msb = 128; ```
