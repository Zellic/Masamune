Therefore, actual seconds calculated is equivalent of 7 months. Therefore, recoverTimelock can be up to a non-sensible value of 7 years, and re-draws every up to 7 months.   ## Impact  Protocol safeguards for time durations are skewed by a factor of 7. Protocol may potentially lock NFT for period of 7 years.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix MONTH_IN_SECONDS calculation: `uint256 immutable MONTH_IN_SECONDS = (3600 * 24) * 30;`
