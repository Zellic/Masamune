Based on a target, the number of missing votes is calculated, which is then used to calculated the total reward amount ([WardenPledge.sol#L325-L327](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L325-L327)): ```solidity function createPledge(     address receiver,     address rewardToken,     uint256 targetVotes,     uint256 rewardPerVote, // reward/veToken/second     uint256 endTimestamp,     uint256 maxTotalRewardAmount,     uint256 maxFeeAmount ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns(uint256){     ...     // Get the missing votes for the given receiver to reach the target votes     // We ignore any delegated boost here because they might expire during the Pledge duration     // (we can have a future version of this contract using adjusted_balance)     vars.votesDifference = targetVotes - votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver);      vars.totalRewardAmount = (rewardPerVote * vars.votesDifference * vars.duration) / UNIT;     ...   } ```  When extending a pledge or increasing a pledge reward per vote, current veToken balance of the pledge's receiver (`votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver)`) can be different from the one it had when the pledge was created (e.g. the receiver managed to lock more CRV or some of locked tokens have expired). However `pledgeParams.votesDifference` is not recalculated ([WardenPledge.sol#L387](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L387), [WardenPledge.sol#L432](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L432)): ```solidity function extendPledge(     uint256 pledgeId,     uint256 newEndTimestamp,     uint256 maxTotalRewardAmount,     uint256 maxFeeAmount ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {     ...

When receiver's veToken balance has increased (i.e. `votesDifference` got in fact smaller), pledge creator will overpay for pledge extension and pledge reward per vote increase. This extra reward cannot be received by pledgers because a receiver cannot get more votes than `pledgeParams.targetVotes` (which is not updated when modifying a pledge):     ```solidity     function _pledge(uint256 pledgeId, address user, uint256 amount, uint256 endTimestamp) internal {         ...         // Check that this will not go over the Pledge target of votes         if(delegationBoost.adjusted_balance_of(pledgeParams.receiver) + amount > pledgeParams.targetVotes) revert Errors.TargetVotesOverflow();         ...     }     ``` 1.

The receiver may lose his reward given to boosters but get nothing in return since her targetVotes is never reached.  ## Proof of Concept According to Curve documentation at https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html  ``` A user’s veCRV balance decays linearly as the remaining time until the CRV unlock decreases. For example, a balance of 4000 CRV locked for one year provides the same amount of veCRV as 2000 CRV locked for two years, or 1000 CRV locked for four years. ```  On creation, targetVotes = 100, balance = 20 -> votesDifference = 80 -> reward is allocated for 80 votes  ```solidity         // Get the missing votes for the given receiver to reach the target votes         // We ignore any delegated boost here because they might expire during the Pledge duration         // (we can have a future version of this contract using adjusted_balance)         vars.votesDifference = targetVotes - votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver);          vars.totalRewardAmount = (rewardPerVote * vars.votesDifference * vars.duration) / UNIT;         vars.feeAmount = (vars.totalRewardAmount * protocalFeeRatio) / MAX_PCT ;         if(vars.totalRewardAmount > maxTotalRewardAmount) revert Errors.IncorrectMaxTotalRewardAmount();         if(vars.feeAmount > maxFeeAmount) revert Errors.IncorrectMaxFeeAmount();          // Pull all the rewards in this contract         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(creator, address(this), vars.totalRewardAmount);         // And transfer the fees from the Pledge creator to the Chest contract         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(creator, chestAddress, vars.feeAmount); ```  Then 1 week passed, receiver's balance decay to 10  On creation, targetVotes = 100, balance = 10 but votesDifference stays 80, and reward has only allocated for 80 votes.  ```solidity         // Rewards are set in the Pledge as reward/veToken/sec         // To find the total amount of veToken delegated through the whole Boost duration         // based on the Boost bias & the Boost duration, to take in account that the delegated amount decreases         // each second of the Boost duration         uint256 totalDelegatedAmount = ((bias * boostDuration) + bias) / 2;         // Then we can calculate the total amount of rewards for this Boost         uint256 rewardAmount = (totalDelegatedAmount * pledgeParams.rewardPerVote) / UNIT;          if(rewardAmount > pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId]) revert Errors.RewardsBalanceTooLow();         pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] -= rewardAmount; ```  A booster boosts 80 votes and takes all rewards in the pool. However, only 80 (From booster) + 10 (From receiver) = 90 votes is active. Not 100 votes that receiver promise in the targetVotes.  Then, if another booster tries to boost 10 votes, it will be reverted with RewardsBalanceTooLow since the first booster has taken all reward that is allocated for only 80 votes.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps You should provide a way for the creator to provide additional rewards after the pledge creation. Or provide some reward refreshment function that recalculates votesDifference and transfers the required additional reward.

The receiver may lose his reward given to boosters but get nothing in return since her targetVotes is never reached.  ## Proof of Concept According to Curve documentation at https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html  ``` A user’s veCRV balance decays linearly as the remaining time until the CRV unlock decreases. For example, a balance of 4000 CRV locked for one year provides the same amount of veCRV as 2000 CRV locked for two years, or 1000 CRV locked for four years. ```  On creation, targetVotes = 100, balance = 20 -> votesDifference = 80 -> reward is allocated for 80 votes  ```solidity         // Get the missing votes for the given receiver to reach the target votes         // We ignore any delegated boost here because they might expire during the Pledge duration         // (we can have a future version of this contract using adjusted_balance)         vars.votesDifference = targetVotes - votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver);          vars.totalRewardAmount = (rewardPerVote * vars.votesDifference * vars.duration) / UNIT;         vars.feeAmount = (vars.totalRewardAmount * protocalFeeRatio) / MAX_PCT ;         if(vars.totalRewardAmount > maxTotalRewardAmount) revert Errors.IncorrectMaxTotalRewardAmount();         if(vars.feeAmount > maxFeeAmount) revert Errors.IncorrectMaxFeeAmount();          // Pull all the rewards in this contract         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(creator, address(this), vars.totalRewardAmount);         // And transfer the fees from the Pledge creator to the Chest contract         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(creator, chestAddress, vars.feeAmount); ```  Then 1 week passed, receiver's balance decay to 10  On creation, targetVotes = 100, balance = 10 but votesDifference stays 80, and reward has only allocated for 80 votes.  ```solidity         // Rewards are set in the Pledge as reward/veToken/sec         // To find the total amount of veToken delegated through the whole Boost duration         // based on the Boost bias & the Boost duration, to take in account that the delegated amount decreases         // each second of the Boost duration         uint256 totalDelegatedAmount = ((bias * boostDuration) + bias) / 2;         // Then we can calculate the total amount of rewards for this Boost         uint256 rewardAmount = (totalDelegatedAmount * pledgeParams.rewardPerVote) / UNIT;          if(rewardAmount > pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId]) revert Errors.RewardsBalanceTooLow();         pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] -= rewardAmount; ```  A booster boosts 80 votes and takes all rewards in the pool. However, only 80 (From booster) + 10 (From receiver) = 90 votes is active. Not 100 votes that receiver promise in the targetVotes.  Then, if another booster tries to boost 10 votes, it will be reverted with RewardsBalanceTooLow since the first booster has taken all reward that is allocated for only 80 votes.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps You should provide a way for the creator to provide additional rewards after the pledge creation. Or provide some reward refreshment function that recalculates votesDifference and transfers the required additional reward.
