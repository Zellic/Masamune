# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  Every time an account is settled, if shortfall is created, due to a wrong calculation shortfall will double in size and add the new shortfall.  ## Impact Loss of funds: users won't be able to withdraw the correct amount of funds. Somebody would have to donate funds to resolve the wrong shortfall.  ## Proof of Concept We can see in the `settleAccount` of `OptimisticLedger` that self.shortfall ends up being self.shortfall+self.shortfall+newShortfall: [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/main/protocol/contracts/collateral/types/OptimisticLedger.sol#L63:#L74) ```     function settleAccount(OptimisticLedger storage self, address account, Fixed18 amount)     internal returns (UFixed18 shortfall) {         Fixed18 newBalance = Fixed18Lib.from(self.balances[account]).add(amount);          if (newBalance.sign() == -1) {             shortfall = self.shortfall.add(newBalance.abs());             newBalance = Fixed18Lib.ZERO;         }          self.balances[account] = newBalance.abs();         self.shortfall = self.shortfall.add(shortfall);     } ```  Additionally, you can add the following line to the "shortfall reverts if depleted" test in Collateral.test.js, line 190: ``` await collateral.connect(productSigner).settleAccount(userB.address, -50) ``` Previously the test product had 50 shortfall. Now we added 50 more, but the test will print that the actual shortfall is 150, and not 100 as it should be.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Move the setting of `self.shortfall` to inside the if function and change the line to: ``` self.shortfall = shortfall ```
