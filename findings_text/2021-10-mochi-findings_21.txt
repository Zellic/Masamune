# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Every time you deposit some assets in the vault (via deposit() of MochiVault.sol) then "lastDeposit[_id]" is set to block.timestamp. The modifier wait() checks this value and makes sure you cannot withdraw for "delay()" blocks. The default value for delay() is 3 minutes.  Knowing this delay you can do a griefing attack: On chains with low gas fees: every 3 minutes deposit a tiny amount for a specific NFT-id (which has a large amount of assets). On chains with high gas fees: monitor the mempool for a withdraw() transaction and frontrun it with a deposit()  This way the owner of the NFT-id can never withdraw the funds.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L47-L54  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L171  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/806ebf2a364c01ff54d546b07d1bdb0e928f42c6/projects/mochi-core/contracts/profile/MochiProfileV0.sol#L33  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Create a mechanism where you only block the withdraw of recently deposited funds
