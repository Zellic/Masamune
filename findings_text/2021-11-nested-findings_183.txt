# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `NestedFactory._handleUnderSpending` function implements a condition as `_amountToSpent - _amountSpent > 0` instead of `_amountToSpent > _amountSpent`. The former reverts if `_amountSpent > _amountToSpent` while the latter doesn't.  It's unclear which behavior is preferred.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Think about if `_amountSpent > _amountToSpent` should revert or not. If not, the `if` condition can be rewritten as `_amountSpent > _amountToSpent` which would also save gas.
