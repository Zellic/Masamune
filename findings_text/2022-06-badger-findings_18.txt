This is `sweepRewardToken()` and `_handleRewardTransfer()` and `_sendTokenToBribesProcessor()` code: ```   /// @dev Function to move rewards that are not protected   /// @notice Only not protected, moves the whole amount using _handleRewardTransfer   /// @notice because token paths are hardcoded, this function is safe to be called by anyone   /// @notice Will not notify the BRIBES_PROCESSOR as this could be triggered outside bribes   function sweepRewardToken(address token) public nonReentrant {       _onlyGovernanceOrStrategist();       _onlyNotProtectedTokens(token);        uint256 toSend = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));       _handleRewardTransfer(token, toSend);   }    function _handleRewardTransfer(address token, uint256 amount) internal {       // NOTE: BADGER is emitted through the tree       if (token == BADGER) {           _sendBadgerToTree(amount);       } else {           // NOTE: All other tokens are sent to bribes processor           _sendTokenToBribesProcessor(token, amount);       }   }    function _sendTokenToBribesProcessor(address token, uint256 amount) internal {       // TODO: Too many SLOADs       IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(address(bribesProcessor), amount);       emit RewardsCollected(token, amount);   } ``` As you can see calling `sweepRewardToken()` eventually (`sweepRewardToken() -> _handleRewardTransfer() -> _sendTokenToBribesProcessor()`) would transfer reward funds to `bribesProcessor` and there is no check that `bribesProcessor!=0x0` in execution follow. so attacker can call `sweepRewardToken()` when `bribesProcessor` is `0x0` and contract will lose all reward tokens.   ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps check the value of `bribesProcessor` in `_sendTokenToBribesProcessor()`
