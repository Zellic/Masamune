# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact PoolFactory and JoinFactory contain very similar but also relatively complicated code. // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/main/contracts/yieldspace/PoolFactory.sol // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/main/contracts/JoinFactory.sol  The risk is that future changes/improvements in one contract might not be updated in the other.  ## Proof of Concept  ## Tools Used Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider refactoring the code where the core code is put in a library and reused from both of the contracts.
