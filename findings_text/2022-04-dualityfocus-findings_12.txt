It's possible that it's set to 200% and then borrows more than the collateral is worth, stealing from the pool.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Disable the possibility of ever having a collateral factor > 100% by checking:  ```diff for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; i++) { +   require(collateralFactorsMantissa[i] <= 1e18, "CF > 100%");     poolCollateralFactors[pools[i]] = collateralFactorsMantissa[i]; } ```
