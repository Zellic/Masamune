This will allow the attacker to create multiple `launchEvent` contracts and get them listed in `allRJLaunchEvents`.  Even though there is no significant impact as far as we can tell from the smart contract code. We believe this is still unexpected and may cause other parts of the system, say the frontend to malfunction in some cases.  ### Recommendation  Consider moving L132 `_token.transferFrom()` to after L147-149 to prevent re-entrance.
