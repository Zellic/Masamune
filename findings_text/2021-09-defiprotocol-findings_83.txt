# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  During the manual code review, It has been observed that zero value has not been checked on that "ibRatio" variable. That can cause  miscalculation of the liquidity.   ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol" 2. Go to the line #217.  """         ibRatio = newRatio; """  3. Onlyauction modifier can assign ibRation to 0. 4. That can affect tokenAmount on the function.   """     function pushUnderlying(uint256 amount, address to) private {         for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {             uint256 tokenAmount = amount * weights[i] * ibRatio / BASE / BASE;             IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(to, tokenAmount);         }     } """  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Validate to ibRatio variable is more than zero.  """ require(ibRation > 0 , "ibRatio should be more than zero"); """
