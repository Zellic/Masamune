# Handle  0x421f   # Vulnerability details  If we see vault registry   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/VaultRegistry.sol#L18  There are two mappings on L18 and L19  On 18 its map(address) => nftID, which is fine  but one on 19. we can remove,  Nft IDs are incremental, and are stored in same position in _vaults[] array so it can be accessed like for id of x => _vaults[x-1]  with this we dont need to maintain it whenever new vault is deployed, again saving gas cost :)
