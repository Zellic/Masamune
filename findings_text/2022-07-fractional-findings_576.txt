One can drain eth out from migration module to buyout module using custom made FERC1155 token.  ## Proof of Concept  - [proof of concept: `testCommitReenter_poc`](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/24c02e069b428f7a95ebc6c931e29b4e#file-2022-07-fractionalv2-poc-modules-t-sol-L283-L339) - [custom made FERC1155 for the attack](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/24c02e069b428f7a95ebc6c931e29b4e#file-2022-07-fractionalv2-poc-modules-t-sol-L6-L63)  The proof of concept shows a scenario where alice is draining migration module using custom made FERC1155 token.  1. setup: other people are using migration module and they deposited some eth. (using alice and bob just to simplify the set up process) 2. alice prepared the custom FERC1155 (let's say `evil_token`) 3. alice create a vault with the `evil_token` 4. alice proposes and joins with 0.5 ether 5. when alice calls `commit`, the `evil_token` will reenter `commit` and send money to buyout module  Note: For a simplicity, the `evil_token` reenters for a fixed number of times. But one can adjust to drain all the eth in the migration module. Note2: For now the eth is in the buyout module, but given the current implementation of `buyout` module, the same actor can drain eth from buyout.  The `commit` function is not written in Checks, Effects, Interactions (CEI) patterns.   ```solidity // modules/Migration.sol::commit // proposal.isCommited and started are set after the out going calls (i.e. start, setApprovalFor) // Mitigation idea: set the values before the out going calls  206         if (currentPrice > proposal.targetPrice) { 207             // Sets token approval to the buyout contract 208             IFERC1155(token).setApprovalFor(address(buyout), id, true); 209             // Starts the buyout process 210             IBuyout(buyout).start{value: proposal.totalEth}(_vault); 211             proposal.isCommited = true; 212             started = true; 213         } ```  ## Tools Used  foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Follow Checks, Effects, Interactions patterns. One can also consider adding reentrancy guard.
