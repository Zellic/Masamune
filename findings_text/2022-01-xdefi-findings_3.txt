# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Extra gas costs of all locking operations.  ## Proof of Concept  XDEFIDistribution.sol stores the total supply of the XDEFI token:  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L14  This is so that the amount being locked can be checked to be less than this on each call  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L255  This is unnecessary as the XDEFI token has no external mint function and so has a fixed supply. It's then impossible for any user to supply more than 240M XDEFI in order to fail this check.  https://etherscan.io/address/0x72b886d09c117654ab7da13a14d603001de0b777#code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the unnecessary check on the total supply.
