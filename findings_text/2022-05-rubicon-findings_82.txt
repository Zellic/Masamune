The `transfer()` function only allows the recipient to use 2300 gas. If the recipient uses more than that, transfers will fail. In the future gas costs might change increasing the likelihood of that happening.  Keep in mind that `call()` introduces the risk of reentrancy. But, as long as the router follows the checks effects interactions pattern it should be fine. It's not supposed to hold any tokens anyway.  ## Proof of Concept See the linked code snippets above.  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace `transfer()` calls with `call()`. Keep in mind to check whether the call was successful by validating the return value:  ```sol (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(""); require(success, "Transfer failed.") ```
