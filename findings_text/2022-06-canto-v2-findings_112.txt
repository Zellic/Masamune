The `CErc20Delegator` is still using `delegateToViewImplementation` for those functions. Those functions can be used, as long as the implementation does not update any state variables, i.e. [the block number increase since the last update is less or equal to the `updateFrequency`](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/NoteInterest.sol#L141). However, when these functions are called after sufficient blocks are mined, they are going to revert. Although one can still call the implementation using [`delegateToImplementation`](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market-v2/blob/443a8c0fed3c5018e95f3881a31b81a555c42b2d/contracts/CErc20Delegator.sol#L437), it is not a good usability, especially if those functions are used for external user interface.   ## Proof Of Concept  [gist for the test](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/37fb99cebed786b4c983d20a76e8793e#file-2022-06-newblockchain-v2-poc-ctoken-test-ts-L49-L62)  The gist shows a simple test. It calls `borrowRatePerBlock` and `supplyRatePerBlock` first time, it suceeds. Then, it mines for more than 300 times, which is the `updateFrequency` parameter. Then it calls again then fails.  Notes on the test file: - The setup is taken from `tests/Treasury/Accountant.test.ts` - using `solidity` from ethereum-waffle for chai to use `reverted`   ```   // in hardhat.config.js   import chai from "chai";   import { solidity } from "ethereum-waffle";    chai.use(solidity);   ```  ## Tools Used  hardhat   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Instead of using `delegateToViewImplementation` use `delegateToImplementation`. Alternatively, implement view functions to query these rates in `NoteInterest.sol` and `CToken.sol`. It will enable to query the rates without spending gas.
