# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There is occurrence in the code of the TransferHelper contract where amount is checked after the external call.  ## Proof of Concept  - Navigate to [TransferHelper.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/TransferHelper.sol) -  Amount is checked after an external call. [TransferHelper.sol amount check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/TransferHelper.sol#L22)  -  To favor readability and avoid confusions, consider applying check at the beginning of function.  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  To favor readability and avoid confusions, consider applying check at the beginning of function.  ```sh   function _safeTransferFrom(address _token, address _sender, uint _amount) internal virtual {     require(_amount > 0, "TransferHelper: amount must be > 0");     ...   } ```
