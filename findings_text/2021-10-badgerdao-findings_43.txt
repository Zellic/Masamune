# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `approve` function has not been overridden and therefore uses the internal _shares_, whereas `transfer(From)` uses the rebalanced amount.  ## Impact The approved spender may spend more tokens than desired. In fact, the approved amount that can be transferred keeps growing with `pricePerShare`.  Many contracts also use the same amount for the `approve` call as for the amount they want to have transferred in a subsequent `transferFrom` call, and in this case, they approve an amount that is too large (as the approved `shares` amount yields a higher rebalanced amount).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `_allowances` field should track the rebalanced amounts such that the approval value does not grow. (This does not actually require overriding the `approve` function.) In `transferFrom`, the approvals should then be subtracted by the _transferred_ `amount`, not the `amountInShares`:  ```solidity // _allowances are in rebalanced amounts such that they don't grow // need to subtract the transferred amount _approve(sender, _msgSender(), _allowances[sender][_msgSender()].sub(amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance")); ```
