# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  For "core", which can be changed by the governance process, an event is emitted when it is changed from 0 to a hopefully valid value in the initialize function.  In the same initialize function the _governance address itself is not verified nor is there an event emitted showing that the governance address has changed from 0 to a different address.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/9c0ea7b3b02675211446f6c81750c5f3c0a86370/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L37-L46  Similar but with Oracle instead of Core. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/9c0ea7b3b02675211446f6c81750c5f3c0a86370/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L38-L45  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit an event reporting governance change or if it is not important to report these initialization events remove the emit for the core initialization.
