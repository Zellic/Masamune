# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  This line in `Swap.setSwapFee()` perfoms an `SLOAD` operation for a value that is already stored in a local variable: ``` emit NewSwapFee(swapFee); ```  ## Impact Storage reads are much more expensive than reading local variables.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the already existing local variable instead of loading this value from storage: ``` emit NewSwapFee(swapFee_); ```
