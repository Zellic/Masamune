# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Several variables are only set once. So it might be useful to make them immutable to reduced the change of accidental updates See the "proof of concept" for examples.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol uint256 public numberOfCards; uint256 public totalNftMintCount; IRCTreasury public treasury; IRCFactory public factory; IRCNftHubL2 public nfthub; IRCOrderbook public orderbook; uint256 public minimumPriceIncreasePercent; uint256 public minRentalDayDivisor; uint256 public maxRentIterations; uint32 public marketOpeningTime; uint32 public override marketLockingTime; uint32 public oracleResolutionTime;    address public artistAddress; address public affiliateAddress; address public marketCreatorAddress; uint256 public creatorCut;     address[] public cardAffiliateAddresses; address public arbitrator; IRealitio public realitio;  //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L113 IRCTreasury public override treasury;      ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the immutable keyword where possible
