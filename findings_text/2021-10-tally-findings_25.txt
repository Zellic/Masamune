# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  `Swap.sol#constructor()` validates `owner_` but does not validate `swapFee_`. While in `setSwapFee()`, it does validates the input to make sure `swapFee_ < SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR`.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L51-L58  ```solidity constructor(address owner_, address payable feeRecipient_, uint256 swapFee_) {         require(owner_ != address(0), "Swap::constructor: Owner must not be 0");         transferOwnership(owner_);         feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;         emit NewFeeRecipient(feeRecipient);         swapFee = swapFee_;         emit NewSwapFee(swapFee);     } ```  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity constructor(address owner_, address payable feeRecipient_, uint256 swapFee_) {     require(owner_ != address(0), "Swap::constructor: Owner must not be 0");     require(swapFee_ < SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR, "Swap::constructor: Swap fee must not exceed 100%");     transferOwnership(owner_);     feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;     emit NewFeeRecipient(feeRecipient);     swapFee = swapFee_;     emit NewSwapFee(swapFee); } ```
