# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `Router.swapWithSynthsWithLimit` allows trading token to token and specifying slippage protection. A token to token trade consists of two trades:  1. token to base 2. base to token  The slippage protection of the second trade (base to token) is computed wrong:  ```solidity require(iUTILS(UTILS()).calcSwapSlip(         inputAmount, // should use outToken here from prev trade         iPOOLS(POOLS).getBaseAmount(outputToken)   ) <= slipLimit ); ```  It compares the **token** input amount (of the first trade) to the **base** reserve of the second pair.  ## Impact  Slippage protection fails and either the trade is cancelled when it shouldn't be or it is accepted even though the user suffered more losses than expected.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It should use the base output from the first trade to check for slippage protection. Note that this still just computes the slippage protection of each trade individually. An even better way would be to come up with a formula to compute the slippage on the two trades at once.
