For maxMint:      MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if mints are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.  When FraxlendPair.sol is paused, deposit and mint are both disabled. This means that maxMint and maxDeposit should return 0 when the contract is paused.   The current implementations of maxMint and maxDeposit do not follow this specification:      function maxDeposit(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }      function maxMint(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }  No matter the state of the contract they always return uint128.max, but they should return 0 when the contract is paused.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  maxDeposit and maxMint should be updated to return 0 when contract is paused. Use of the whenNotPaused modifier is not appropriate because that would cause a revert and maxDeposit and maxMint should never revert according to EIP-4626
