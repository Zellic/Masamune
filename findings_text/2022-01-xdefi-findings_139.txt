# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  `_zeroDurationPointBase` can be set at deploy time so that locks with 0 duration can get scores.  However, if the value of `_zeroDurationPointBase` is being set high enough. It can potentially be exploited by repeatedly lock(), and unlock() with 0 duration to get scores.  This can get amplified with flashloans.  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L245-L247  ```solidity function _getPoints(uint256 amount_, uint256 duration_) internal view returns (uint256 points_) {     return amount_ * (duration_ + _zeroDurationPointBase); } ```  ## Recommendation  Consider changing `_zeroDurationPointBase` to a constant of value `1`.
