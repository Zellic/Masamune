# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `UniswapConfig.getTokenConfigBySymbolHash` function does not work as `getSymbolHashIndex` returns `0` if there is no config token for that symbol (uninitialized map value), but the outer function implements the non-existence check with `-1`.  The same issue occurs also for:  - `getTokenConfigByCToken` - `getTokenConfigByUnderlying`  ## Impact  When encountering a non-existent token config, it will always return the token config of the **first index** (index 0) which is a valid token config for a completely different token. This leads to wrong oracle prices for the actual token which could in the worst case be used to borrow more tokens at a lower price or borrow more tokens by having a higher collateral value, essentially allowing undercollateralized loans that cannot be liquidated.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Fix the non-existence check.
