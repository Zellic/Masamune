# Handle  itsmeSTYJ   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas optimisation. In the function `transferNotionalFee()`,  `sVault.exchangeRate` is only 0 for the very first time this function is called so the if check to see if `sVault.exchangeRate != 0` is only used once to handle this edge case.  It makes more sense to set the exchangeRate when the vault is created and remove these if conditions.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx constructor(uint256 m, address c, address s) {    admin = msg.sender;    maturity = m;    cTokenAddr = c;    swivel = s;   uint256 exchangeRate = CErc20(cTokenAddr).exchangeRateCurrent();   vault[swivel] = Vault({        notional: 0,        redeemable: 0,        exchangeRate: exchangeRate    }); } ... function transferNotionalFee(address f, uint256 a) external onlyAdmin(admin) returns(bool) {     Vault memory oVault = vaults[f];     Vault memory sVault = vaults[swivel];      // remove notional from its owner     oVault.notional -= a;      uint256 exchangeRate = CErc20(cTokenAddr).exchangeRateCurrent();     uint256 yield;     uint256 interest;      // check if exchangeRate has been stored already this block. If not, calculate marginal interest + store exchangeRate     if (sVault.exchangeRate != exchangeRate) {        // if market has matured, calculate marginal interest between the maturity rate and previous position exchange rate        // otherwise, calculate marginal exchange rate between current and previous exchange rate.        if (matured) {            // calculate marginal interest            yield = ((maturityRate * 1e26) / sVault.exchangeRate) - 1e26;        } else {            yield = ((exchangeRate * 1e26) / sVault.exchangeRate) - 1e26;        }          interest = (yield * sVault.notional) / 1e26;        sVault.redeemable += interest;       sVault.exchangeRate = exchangeRate;     }      // add notional to swivel's vault     sVault.notional += a;      // store the adjusted vaults     vaults[swivel] = sVault;     vaults[f] = oVault;     return true;   } ```
