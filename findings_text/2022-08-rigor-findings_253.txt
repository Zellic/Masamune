So if such task is added by mistake, it would require more time and effort to finish because builder must complete it by himself to recover tokens.   ## Proof of Concept It will work properly when _amount = 0.  ``` function checkPrecision(uint256 _amount) internal pure {      // Divide and multiply amount with 1000 should be equal to amount.     // This ensures the amount is not too precise.     require(         ((_amount / 1000) * 1000) == _amount,         "Project::Precision>=1000"     ); } ```  ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend changing like below.   ``` function checkPrecision(uint256 _amount) internal pure {      require(_amount > 0, "zero amount");      // Divide and multiply amount with 1000 should be equal to amount.     // This ensures the amount is not too precise.     require(         ((_amount / 1000) * 1000) == _amount,         "Project::Precision>=1000"     ); } ```
