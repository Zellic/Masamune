This means that after `liquidateClean`, borrower's shares will be greater than `0` (leftover shares after liquidations), but the user is still insolvent and can be liquidated again and again (with `_sharesToLiquidate` set to `0`). Each subsequent liquidation will write off the bad debt (reduce pair totals by borrower leftover shares/amounts), but doesn't take anything from liquidator nor borrower (since `_sharesToLiquidate == 0`).  This messes up the whole pair accounting, with total asset amounts reducing and total borrow amounts and shares reducing. This will make it impossible for borrowers to repay debt (or be liquidated), because borrow totals will underflow, and lenders amount to withdraw will reduce a lot (they will share non-existant huge bad debt).  Reducing pair totals scenario: 1. Alice borrows `1000 FRAX` (`1000` shares) against `1.5 ETH` collateral (`1 ETH = 1000`, `Max LTV` = `75%`) 2. ETH drops to `500` very quickly with liquidators being unable to liquidate Alice due to network congestion 3. At ETH = `500`, Alice collateral is worth `750` against `1000 FRAX` debt, making Alice insolvent and in a bad debt 4. Liquidator calls `liquidateClean` for `800` shares, which cleans up all available collateral of `1.5 ETH`. 5. At this point Alice has `200` shares debt with `0` collateral 6. Liquidator repeatedly calls `liquidateClean` with `0` shares to liquidate. Each call pair totals are reduced by `200` shares (and total borrow amount by a corresponding amount). 7. When pair totals reach close to `0`, the pool is effectively locked. Borrowers can't repay, lenders can withdraw severly reduced amounts.  ## Proof of Concept  Copy this to src/test/e2e/LiquidationBugTest.sol  https://gist.github.com/panprog/cbdc1658d63c30c9fe94127a4b4b7e72   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  After the line  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/c4189a3a98b38c8c962c5ea72f1a322fbc2ae45f/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1012  add          _sharesToLiquidate += _sharesToAdjust;

For maxMint:      MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if mints are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.  When FraxlendPair.sol is paused, deposit and mint are both disabled. This means that maxMint and maxDeposit should return 0 when the contract is paused.   The current implementations of maxMint and maxDeposit do not follow this specification:      function maxDeposit(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }      function maxMint(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }  No matter the state of the contract they always return uint128.max, but they should return 0 when the contract is paused.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  maxDeposit and maxMint should be updated to return 0 when contract is paused. Use of the whenNotPaused modifier is not appropriate because that would cause a revert and maxDeposit and maxMint should never revert according to EIP-4626

According to comments in FraxlendPairCore this should act as a constant/immutable value. Given that this value will be define through function **setTimeLock** in **FraxLendPair** contract this value can changed whenever the owner wants. This does not seem the expected behaviour.  ## Proof of Concept The owner can call whenever they want the function **setTimeLock**, which reset the value of **TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS**  ## Tools Used Manual read  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a bool which act as mutex if **TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS** has already been set, and modify **setTimeLock** function in FraxlendPair contract ```solidity // In FraxlendPair contract bool public timelockSetted; function setTimeLock(address _newAddress) external onlyOwner {         require(!timelockSetted);         emit SetTimeLock(TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS, _newAddress);         TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS = _newAddress;         timelockeSetted=true; } ```

This means that after `liquidateClean`, borrower's shares will be greater than `0` (leftover shares after liquidations), but the user is still insolvent and can be liquidated again and again (with `_sharesToLiquidate` set to `0`). Each subsequent liquidation will write off the bad debt (reduce pair totals by borrower leftover shares/amounts), but doesn't take anything from liquidator nor borrower (since `_sharesToLiquidate == 0`).  This messes up the whole pair accounting, with total asset amounts reducing and total borrow amounts and shares reducing. This will make it impossible for borrowers to repay debt (or be liquidated), because borrow totals will underflow, and lenders amount to withdraw will reduce a lot (they will share non-existant huge bad debt).  Reducing pair totals scenario: 1. Alice borrows `1000 FRAX` (`1000` shares) against `1.5 ETH` collateral (`1 ETH = 1000`, `Max LTV` = `75%`) 2. ETH drops to `500` very quickly with liquidators being unable to liquidate Alice due to network congestion 3. At ETH = `500`, Alice collateral is worth `750` against `1000 FRAX` debt, making Alice insolvent and in a bad debt 4. Liquidator calls `liquidateClean` for `800` shares, which cleans up all available collateral of `1.5 ETH`. 5. At this point Alice has `200` shares debt with `0` collateral 6. Liquidator repeatedly calls `liquidateClean` with `0` shares to liquidate. Each call pair totals are reduced by `200` shares (and total borrow amount by a corresponding amount). 7. When pair totals reach close to `0`, the pool is effectively locked. Borrowers can't repay, lenders can withdraw severly reduced amounts.  ## Proof of Concept  Copy this to src/test/e2e/LiquidationBugTest.sol  https://gist.github.com/panprog/cbdc1658d63c30c9fe94127a4b4b7e72   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  After the line  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/c4189a3a98b38c8c962c5ea72f1a322fbc2ae45f/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1012  add          _sharesToLiquidate += _sharesToAdjust;

For maxMint:      MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if mints are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.  When FraxlendPair.sol is paused, deposit and mint are both disabled. This means that maxMint and maxDeposit should return 0 when the contract is paused.   The current implementations of maxMint and maxDeposit do not follow this specification:      function maxDeposit(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }      function maxMint(address) external pure returns (uint256) {         return type(uint128).max;     }  No matter the state of the contract they always return uint128.max, but they should return 0 when the contract is paused.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  maxDeposit and maxMint should be updated to return 0 when contract is paused. Use of the whenNotPaused modifier is not appropriate because that would cause a revert and maxDeposit and maxMint should never revert according to EIP-4626

Recipe:  - Call `globalPause` with any valid address. - The transaction will FAULT.  ## Affected source code  - [FraxlendPairDeployer.sol#L405](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/c4189a3a98b38c8c962c5ea72f1a322fbc2ae45f/src/contracts/FraxlendPairDeployer.sol#L405)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Initialize the `_updatedAddresses` array like shown bellow:  ```diff     function globalPause(address[] memory _addresses) external returns (address[] memory _updatedAddresses) {         require(msg.sender == CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ADDRESS, "Circuit Breaker only");         address _pairAddress;         uint256 _lengthOfArray = _addresses.length; +       _updatedAddresses = new address[](_lengthOfArray);         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _lengthOfArray; ) {             _pairAddress = _addresses[i];             try IFraxlendPair(_pairAddress).pause() {                 _updatedAddresses[i] = _addresses[i];             } catch {}             unchecked {                 i = i + 1;             }         }     } ```
