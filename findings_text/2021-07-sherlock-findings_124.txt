# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the `calcUnderlying` function of LibSherX.sol, the value `gs.tokensSherX.length` can be written down once to save gas (around 300-500 when called in the present tests).  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibSherX.sol#L55-L60  ## Tools Used hardhat gas calculator  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Suggested adding `uint256 SherXLength = gs.tokensSherX.length;` and replacing this value throughout the function (three instances).
