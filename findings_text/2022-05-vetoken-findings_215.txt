However, there is no validation check to ensure that that `_lockFeesIncentive` and `_stakerLockFeesIncentive` add up to `10000`. Thus, it entirely depends on the developer to get these two values right.  As such, it is possible to set `lockFeesIncentive + takerLockFeesIncentive` to be less than `100%`. This might happen due to human error. For instance, a typo (forget a few zero) or newly joined developer might not be aware of the fee denomination and called `setFeeInfo(40, 60)` instead of `setFeeInfo(4000, 6000)`.

Any veAsset (e.g. CRV, ANGLE) sitting on the `Booster` contract is claimable. However, in this case, the `feeToken` is likely not a veAsset, thus the remaining gauge fee will be stuck in the `Booster` contract perpetually. For instance, in Curve, the gauge fee is paid out in 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool. ([Source](https://resources.curve.fi/crv-token/understanding-crv#staking-trading-fees))  ## Impact  Users will lost their gauge fee if this happens.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement validation check to ensure that `lockFeesIncentive` and `takerLockFeesIncentive` add up to 100% to eliminate any risk of misconfiguration.  ```solidity uint256 public constant FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10000;  // Set reward token and claim contract, get from Curve's registry function setFeeInfo(uint256 _lockFeesIncentive, uint256 _stakerLockFeesIncentive) external {     require(msg.sender == feeManager, "!auth");     require(_lockFeesIncentive + _stakerLockFeesIncentive == FEE_DENOMINATOR, "Invalid fees");      lockFeesIncentive = _lockFeesIncentive;     stakerLockFeesIncentive = _stakerLockFeesIncentive;     ..SNIP.. } ```
