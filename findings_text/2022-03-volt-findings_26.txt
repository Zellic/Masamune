This generally isn't the case as it could be a completely different oracle, not even operated by Chainlink.  If the main oracle fails, the backup oracle could be scaled by a wrong amount and return a wrong price which could lead to users being able to mint volt cheap or redeem volt for inflated underlying amounts.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Should there be two scaling factors, one for each oracle?
