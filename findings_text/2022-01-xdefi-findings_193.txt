# Handle  Czar102   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  An owner of the contract may, by ordering their or others' locking transactions, significantly increase or decrease `bonusMultiplier` for some set of transactions.  So, by mining a single block, an owner can lower other's bonus multipliers, execute locking transactions and then restore bonus multipliers.  A user might send a locking transaction in a similar time as an owner lowers the multipliers, resulting in lowering the revenue against data presented to the user.  An owner can also pass ownership to a contract that will change bonus multipliers and lock funds with a very high bonus multiplier, then restore previous multipliers' state not to let others do the same. This way, the owner can gain an unfair advantage over others.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use a timelock for `setLockPeriods(...)` function and require passing `bonusMultiplier` in locking functions, revert if they are different from the state variables.
