# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  On L189, we use a uint8 as the for loop variable: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus/blob/63f7639aad08f2bba717830ed81e0649f7fc23ee/contracts/amm/TempusAMM.sol#L189  Due to how the EVM natively works on 256 numbers, using a 8 bit number here introduces additional costs as the EVM has to properly enforce the limits of this smaller type.  See the warning at this link: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change i to be a uint256 and replace any similar uints which only exist in memory and aren't required to use a smaller type.
