The migration would therefore revert.  ## Proof of Concept  Insert this test into [`StrategyPUSDConvex.ts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/tests/StrategyPUSDConvex.ts).  ```jsx it.only("will revert when attempting to migrate strategy", async () => {   await controller.setVault(want.address, yVault.address);   await expect(controller.setStrategy(want.address, strategy.address)).to.be.revertedWith("jpeg"); }); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace `_current.withdraw(address(jpeg));` with `_current.withdrawJPEG(vaults[_token])`.
