# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The owner of Factory contract can modify the values of `auctionMultiplier` and `auctionDecrement` at any time. During an auction, these values are used to calculate `newRatio` and thereby `tokensNeeded`: specifically, it's easy to set the factory parameters so that `tokensNeeded = 0` (or close to zero) for every token. This way the owner can participate at an auction, change the parameters, and get the underlying tokens from a Basket without transferring any pending tokens.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L99  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adding a Timelock to these Factory functions. Otherwise a way to not modify them if an auction is ongoing (maybe Auction saves the values it reads when `startAuction` is called).
