It can induce that operators won't perform their job if a gas price spike happens due to negative profit.  But your designed mechanism has a vulnerability. Other operators can submit their transaction to the mempool and queue it using `gasPrice in bridgeInRequestPayload`. It may get executed before the selected operator as the selected operator is waiting for the gas price to drop but doesn't submit any transaction yet. If it doesn't, these operators lose a little gas fee. But a slashed reward may be greater than the risk of losing a little gas fee.  ```solidity require(timeDifference > 0, "HOLOGRAPH: operator has time"); ```  Once 1 epoch has passed, selected operator is vulnerable to slashing and frontrunning.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Modify your operator node software to queue transactions immediately with `gasPrice in bridgeInRequestPayload` if a gas price spike happened. Or allow gas fee loss tradeoff to prevent being slashed.
