# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `MixinTransfer.shareKey` function wants to compute a fee such that `time + fee * time == timeRemaining (timePlusFee)`:  ```solidity uint fee = getTransferFee(keyOwner, _timeShared); uint timePlusFee = _timeShared + fee; ```  However, if the time remaining is less than the computed fee time, **the computation changes and a different formula is applied**. The fee is now simply taken on the remaining time.  ```solidity if(timePlusFee < timeRemaining) {   // now we can safely set the time   time = _timeShared;   // deduct time from parent key, including transfer fee   _timeMachine(_tokenId, timePlusFee, false); } else {   // we have to recalculate the fee here   fee = getTransferFee(keyOwner, timeRemaining);   // @audit want it such that time + fee * time == timeRemaining, but fee is taken on timeRemaining instead of time   time = timeRemaining - fee; } ```  It should compute the `time` without fee as `time = timeRemaining / (1.0 + fee_as_decimal)` instead, i.e., `time = BASIS_POINTS_DEN * timeRemaining / (transferFeeBasisPoints + BASIS_POINTS_DEN)`.  #### POC To demonstrate the difference with a 10% fee and a `_timeShared = 10,000s` which should be credited to the `to` account.  The correct time plus fee which is reduced from `from` (as in the `timePlusFee < timeRemaining` branch) would be `10,000 + 10% * 10,000 = 11,000`.  However, if `from` has not enough time remaining and `timePlusFee >= timeRemaining`, the entire time remaining is reduced from `from` but the credited `time` is computed wrongly as: (Let's assume `timeRemaining == timePlusFee`): `time = 11,000 - 10% * 11,000 = 11,000 - 1,100 = 9900`.  They would receive 100 seconds less than what they are owed.  ## Impact When transferring more time than the `from` account has, the credited time is scaled down wrongly and the receiver receives less time (a larger fee is applied).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It should change the first `if` branch condition to `timePlusFee <= timeRemaining` (less than or equal). In the `else` branch, it should compute the time without fee as `time = BASIS_POINTS_DEN * timeRemaining / (transferFeeBasisPoints + BASIS_POINTS_DEN)`.
