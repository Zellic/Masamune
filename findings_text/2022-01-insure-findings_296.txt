# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  The spec doesn't match with the comments in the code here:   Code: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/Factory.sol#L90-L91 Spec: https://insuredao.gitbook.io/developers/market/factory#approvetemplate  Here, the spec doesn't mention `_isOpen` and seem to confuse the `_approval` description with what `_isOpen` should be.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps My guess is that the spec should be corrected
