# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Save Gas With The Unchecked Keyword (L2LPTDataCache.sol)  Redundant arithmetic underflow/overflow checks can be avoided when an underflow/overflow cannot happen.  ## Proof of Concept The "unchecked" keyword can be applied here since there is an `if` statement before to ensure the arithmetic operations would not cause an integer underflow or overflow.: https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/gateway/L2LPTDataCache.sol#L57-L69  Change the code to:  ```     function decreaseL2SupplyFromL1(uint256 _amount) external onlyL2LPTGateway {         // If there is a mass withdrawal from L2, _amount could exceed l2SupplyFromL1.         // In this case, we just set l2SupplyFromL1 = 0 because there will be no more supply on L2         // that is from L1 and the excess (_amount - l2SupplyFromL1) is inflationary LPT that was         // never from L1 in the first place.         unchecked {             if (_amount > l2SupplyFromL1) {                 l2SupplyFromL1 = 0;             } else {                 l2SupplyFromL1 -= _amount;  // @audit unchecked             }         }          // No event because the L2LPTGateway events are sufficient     }   ```  A similar change can be made here: https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/gateway/L2LPTDataCache.sol#L91-L94  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the "unchecked" keyword as shown above.
