# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Some of the contracts set variables in the initialize function that are never changed. See for examples in the "proof of concept" section. Here the solidity keyword "immutable" could be added to the variables as an extra security measure.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L17     address public tracer;     IInsurance public insurance;     IOracle public oracle;          https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Liquidation.sol#L24     uint256 public override maxSlippage;     IPricing public pricing;     ITracerPerpetualSwaps public tracer;     address public insuranceContract;     address public fastGasOracle;          //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Insurance.sol#L20       address public collateralAsset; // Address of collateral asset      address public token; // token representation of a users holding in the pool      ITracerPerpetualSwaps public tracer; // Tracer associated with Insurance Pool   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add immutable where possible
