# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `getAddedAmount` function only works correctly when called with `(VADER/USDV, pool)` or `(pool, pool)`. However, when called with (`token, pool)` where `token` is neither `VADER/USDV/pool`, it returns wrong results:  1. It gets the `token` balance 2. And subtracts it from the stored `mapToken_tokenAmount[_pool]` amount which can be that of a completely different token  ## Impact  Anyone can break individual pairs by calling `sync(token1, token2)` where the `token1` balance is less than `mapToken_tokenAmount[token2]`. This will add the difference to `mapToken_tokenAmount[token2]` and break the accounting and result in a wrong swap logic.  Furthermore, this can also be used to swap tokens without having to pay anthing with `swap(token1, token2, member, toBase=false)`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a require statement in the `else` branch that checks that `_token == _pool`.
