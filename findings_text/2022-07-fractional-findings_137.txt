Under certain conditions it may even cause complete loss of access to the vault. In this same example, if less than 5 fractions can be redeemed (i.e. not enough people have more than 10% to overcome the precision loss) then the vault would never be able to be bought out and the vault would forever be frozen.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps When calling propose require that _newFractionSupply is greater than some value (i.e. 1E18)
