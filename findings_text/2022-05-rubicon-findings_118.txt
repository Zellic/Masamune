# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/rubiconPools/BathHouse.sol#L264   # Vulnerability details  There is no option to revoke strategist's privilege. As the strategist is a very strategic role which can effectively steal LP's funds, this is very dangerous.  ## Impact A rogue / compromised / cancelled strategist can not be revoked of permissions.  ## Proof of Concept There's a function to [approve](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/rubiconPools/BathHouse.sol#L264) a strategist, but no option to revoke the access.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a function / change the function and allow setting strategist's access to false.
