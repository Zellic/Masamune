# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `stopLiquidation` does not pull fund from `Liquidator` while setting `_liquidator` to address(0). Since the `DebtLocker` own `Liquidator` and there are no way to set `_liquidator` to existing address, fund still in `Liquidator` would be stuck unless `DebtLocker` is upgraded to support such behavior.  Also, when `stopLiquidation` is called, remaining fund in Liquidator can still be liquidated by keepers.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/maple-labs/debt-locker/blob/81f55907db7b23d27e839b9f9f73282184ed4744/contracts/DebtLocker.sol#L112 ```     function stopLiquidation() external override {         require(msg.sender == _getPoolDelegate(), "DL:SL:NOT_PD");          _liquidator = address(0);          emit LiquidationStopped();     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Pull remaining fund in `stopLiquidation`
