Depositing 1000 amount should mint 1000 supply, but one can split the 1000 amounts into two 500 deposits and use re-entrancy to profit.  - Outer `deposit(500)`: `balanceBefore = 1000`. Control is given to attacker ... - Inner `deposit(500)`: `balanceBefore = 1000`. `shares = (_amount * supply) / balanceBefore = 500 * 1000 / 1000 = 500` shares are minted ... - Outer `deposit(500)` continues with the mint: `shares = (_amount * supply) / balanceBefore = 500 * 1500 / 1000 = 750` are minted. - Withdrawing the `500 + 750 = 1250` shares via `withdraw(1250)`, the attacker receives `backingTokens = (balance() * _shares) / supply = 2000 * 1250 / 2250 = 1111.111111111`. The attacker makes a profit of `1111 - 1000 = 111` tokens. - They repeat the attack until the vault is drained.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `safeTransferFrom` should be the last call in `deposit`.
