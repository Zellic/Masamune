As as in all other logics when `amount` is `0x0` code set `timestamp` to `0x0` too but here that logic is not happening for this cases (amount equal to `noVesting` or `noVesting + vestedThreeMonths` or ...).  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps change if conditions from `>` to `>=`, so for equal case the code set `timestamp` to `0x0` too.
