# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/peripheral_contracts/BathBuddy.sol#L69   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The BathBuddy contract is able to receive ETH. But, there's no way of ever retrieving that ETH from the contract. The funds will be locked up.  Currently, there seems to be no logic in the protocol where ETH is sent to the contract. But, it might happen in the future. So I'd say it's a MED issue.  ## Proof of Concept `receive()`  function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/peripheral_contracts/BathBuddy.sol#L69  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the `receive()` function if the contract isn't supposed to handle ETH. Otherwise, add the necessary logic to release the ETH it gets.
