# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  On the ERC20, There is a known problem named as Approve/TransferFrom race condition. On the transferFrom, allowance max check has not been added.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following contract.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/InsureDAOERC20.sol#L152  ```     function transferFrom(         address sender,         address recipient,         uint256 amount     ) public virtual override returns (bool) {         uint256 currentAllowance = _allowances[sender][_msgSender()];         if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {             require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");             unchecked {                 _approve(sender, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);             }         }          _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);          return true;     }  ```  2. Max Allowance check has not been added into the function. ERC20 standart (Openzeppelin) is not followed.  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider to use openzeppelin erc20 contract. The sample transferFrom function can be seen from below.   ```     function transferFrom(         address sender,         address recipient,         uint256 amount     ) public virtual override returns (bool) {         uint256 currentAllowance = _allowances[sender][_msgSender()];         if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {             require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");             unchecked {                 _approve(sender, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);             }         }          _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);          return true;     } ```  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L161
