Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`, they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see [`lend`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/blob/e8015d7c4b295af131f017e646ba1b99c8f608f0/contracts/NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L159). Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the **current** origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Reconsider how the min loan amount works. Imo, this `minLoanAmount` should be the post-fee amount, not the pre-fee amount. It's also more intuitive for the borrower when creating the loan.
