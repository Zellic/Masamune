However, the underlying yield tokens price may go down. If Luna/UST things happen again, users' funds may get locked.  [LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137) Moreover, the withdrawal of the lidoVault takes a swap from the curve pool. 1 stEth worth 0.98 ETH at the time of writing. The vault can not withdraw at the current market.  Given that users' funds would be locked in the lidoVault, I consider this a high-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept [1 stEth  = 0.98 Eth](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1524717773959700481/photo/1)  [LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137)   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are different ways to set the slippage.   The first one is to let users determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take. The protocol front-end should set the recommended value for them. ```solidity   function withdrawCollateral(     address _asset,     uint256 _amount,     address _to,     uint256 _minReceiveAmount   ) external virtual {       // ...     require(withdrawAmount >= _minReceiveAmount, Errors.VT_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_MISMATCH);   } ```   The second one is have a slippage control parameters that's set by the operator.  ```solidity     // Exchange stETH -> ETH via Curve     uint256 receivedETHAmount = CurveswapAdapter.swapExactTokensForTokens(       _addressesProvider,       _addressesProvider.getAddress('STETH_ETH_POOL'),       LIDO,       ETH,       yieldStETH,       maxSlippage     ); ```  ```solidity     function setMaxSlippage(uint256 _slippage) external onlyOperator {         maxSlippage = _slippage;          //@audit This action usually emit an event.         emit SetMaxSlippage(msg.sender, slippage);     } ```  These are two common ways to deal with this issue. I prefer the first one. The market may corrupt really fast before the operator takes action. It's nothing fun watching the number go down while having no option.

As reward token list is external and an arbitrary token can end up there, in the case when such token doesn't allow for zero amount transfers, the reward retrieval can become unavailable.  I.e. processYield() can be fully blocked for even an extended period, with some low probability, which cannot be controlled otherwise as pool reward token list is external.  Setting the severity to medium as reward gathering is a base functionality for the system and its availability is affected.  ## Proof of Concept  _transferYield proceeds with sending the amounts to treasury and yieldManager without checking:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L74-L82  ```solidity     // transfer to treasury     if (_vaultFee > 0) {       uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);       yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);     }      // transfer to yieldManager     address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');     TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount); ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L205-L209  ```solidity   function _processTreasury(address _asset, uint256 _yieldAmount) internal returns (uint256) {     uint256 treasuryAmount = _yieldAmount.percentMul(_vaultFee);     IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_treasuryAddress, treasuryAmount);     return treasuryAmount;   } ```  The incentive token can be arbitrary. Some ERC20 do not allow zero amounts to be sent:  https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers  In a situation of such a token added to reward list and zero incentive amount earned the whole processYield call will revert, making reward gathering unavailable until either such token be removed from pool's reward token list or some non-zero reward amount be earned. Both are external processes and aren’t controllable.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider running the transfers in _transferYield only when yieldAmount is positive:  ```solidity + if (yieldAmount > 0) {      // transfer to treasury      if (_vaultFee > 0) {        uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);        yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);      }       // transfer to yieldManager      address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');      TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount); +  } ```

In particular, all swaps using ETH path will use the wrong pool as it will use the ETH / USDC 1% one due to this [line](https://github.com/sturdyfi/code4rena-may-2022/blob/d53f4f5f0b7b33a66e0081294be6117f6d6e17b4/contracts/protocol/libraries/swap/UniswapAdapter.sol#L50).    ## Proof of Concept For example for CRV / USDC, the optimal route is currently CRV -> ETH and ETH -> USDC, and the pool ETH / USDC with 1% fees is tiny compared to the ones with 0.3 or 0.1%. Therefore using the current implementation would create a significant loss of revenue.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Basic mitigation would be to hardcode in advance the best Uniswap paths in a mapping like it’s done for Curve pools, then pass this path already computed to the swapping library. This would allow for complex route and save gas costs as you would avoid computing them in `swapExactTokensForTokens`.  Then, speaking from experience, as `distributeYield` is `onlyAdmin`, you may want to add the possibility to do the swaps through an efficient aggregator like 1Inch or Paraswap, it will be way more optimal.

In particular, all swaps using ETH path will use the wrong pool as it will use the ETH / USDC 1% one due to this [line](https://github.com/sturdyfi/code4rena-may-2022/blob/d53f4f5f0b7b33a66e0081294be6117f6d6e17b4/contracts/protocol/libraries/swap/UniswapAdapter.sol#L50).    ## Proof of Concept For example for CRV / USDC, the optimal route is currently CRV -> ETH and ETH -> USDC, and the pool ETH / USDC with 1% fees is tiny compared to the ones with 0.3 or 0.1%. Therefore using the current implementation would create a significant loss of revenue.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Basic mitigation would be to hardcode in advance the best Uniswap paths in a mapping like it’s done for Curve pools, then pass this path already computed to the swapping library. This would allow for complex route and save gas costs as you would avoid computing them in `swapExactTokensForTokens`.  Then, speaking from experience, as `distributeYield` is `onlyAdmin`, you may want to add the possibility to do the swaps through an efficient aggregator like 1Inch or Paraswap, it will be way more optimal.
