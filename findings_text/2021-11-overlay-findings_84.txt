# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Based on the context, `marginBurnRate` should be able to be updated after deployment. However, there is no function to update it.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/1833b792caf3eb8756b1ba5f50f9c2ce085e54d0/contracts/mothership/OverlayV1Mothership.sol#L158-L166  ```solidity=158 function adjustGlobalParams(     uint16 _fee,     uint16 _feeBurnRate,     address _feeTo,     uint _marginBurnRate ) external onlyGovernor {     fee = _fee;     feeBurnRate = _feeBurnRate;     feeTo = _feeTo;     marginBurnRate = _marginBurnRate; } ```  Or change `marginBurnRate` to immutable if it's not supposed to be updated later (for gas saving).
