Underlying asset price oracle for CToken in BaseV1-periphery is inaccuarte  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  ```     function getUnderlyingPrice(CToken ctoken) external override view returns(uint price) {         IBaseV1Pair pair;         uint8 stable;         bool stablePair;         address underlying;          if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cCANTO")) {             stable = 0;             underlying = address(wcanto);         }          //set price statically to 1 when the Comptroller is retrieving Price         else if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cNOTE") && msg.sender == Comptroller) {             return 1; // Note price is fixed to 1         } ```  we should not be return 1. 1 is 1 wei. we should be 10 ** 18  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  we can return 10 ** 18
