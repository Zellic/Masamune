# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  Here's the only `_investWETHToBuyNOTE()` call: ``` File: TreasuryManager.sol 140:     function investWETHToBuyNOTE(uint256 wethAmount) external onlyManager { 141:         _investWETHToBuyNOTE(wethAmount); 142:     } ```  While I can understand why some functions have the same style, these other functions are as such because they are calling an inherited function, as an example for `setSlippageLimit()`, which really is calling an inherited function from `EIP1271Wallet.sol`: ``` File: TreasuryManager.sol 89:     function setSlippageLimit(address tokenAddress, uint256 slippageLimit) 90:         external 91:         onlyOwner 92:     { 93:         _setSlippageLimit(tokenAddress, slippageLimit); 94:     } ```  However, for `_investWETHToBuyNOTE()`, this style doesn't hold.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps All the logic from `_investWETHToBuyNOTE()` should be inlined in `investWETHToBuyNOTE()` to save gas.
