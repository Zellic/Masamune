Users should use `closeLoan` in this case but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds.  It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where `interest` will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the `loan.loanAmount` is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check that there actually is something to repay.  ```solidity require(loan.lastAccumulatedTimestamp > 0, "loan was never matched by a lender. use closeLoan instead"); ```
