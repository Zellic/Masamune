# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It's possible to save gas by optimizing the checks in conditional statements (`if`, `else if` and `else`). This would save a few opcodes and avoid redundant checks.  ## Proof of Concept In `IndexTemplate.sol:deposit()`, the code is as follows: ``` 172:         if (_supply > 0 && _totalLiquidity > 0) {   173:             _mintAmount = (_amount * _supply) / _totalLiquidity; 174:         } else if (_supply > 0 && _totalLiquidity == 0) { 175:             //when 176:             _mintAmount = _amount * _supply; 177:         } else { 178:             _mintAmount = _amount; 179:         } ```  The conditions checks can be optimized with the following (read the `@audit-info` comments for further information): ```       if (_supply == 0) {           _mintAmount = _amount;       } else if (_totalLiquidity == 0) { // @audit-info : implicit _supply > 0 as above condition is false           _mintAmount = _amount * _supply;       } else { // @audit-info : implicit _supply > 0 and _totalLiquidity > 0 as both the previous conditions are false           _mintAmount = (_amount * _supply) / _totalLiquidity;       } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Compact conditions in mentioned logic statements
