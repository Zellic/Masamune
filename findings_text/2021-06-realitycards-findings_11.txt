# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Within RCMarket.sol the functions ownerOf and onlyTokenOwner do not check if the _cardId/_token is smaller than numberOfCards. So it's possible to supply a larger number and access cards of other markets. The most problematic seems to be upgradeCard. Here the check for isMarketApproved can be circumvented by trying to move the card via another market.  You can still only move cards you own.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L338     function ownerOf(uint256 _cardId) public view override returns (address) {         uint256 _tokenId = _cardId + totalNftMintCount; // doesn't check if _cardId < numberOfCards         return nfthub.ownerOf(_tokenId);     }  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L313   modifier onlyTokenOwner(uint256 _token) {         require(msgSender() == ownerOf(_token), "Not owner"); // _token could be higher than numberOfCards,         _;     }    function upgradeCard(uint256 _card) external onlyTokenOwner(_card) {   // _card  could be higher than numberOfCards,         _checkState(States.WITHDRAW);         require(             !factory.trapIfUnapproved() ||                 factory.isMarketApproved(address(this)),   // this can be circumvented by calling the function via another market             "Upgrade blocked"         );         uint256 _tokenId = _card + totalNftMintCount;    // _card  could be higher than numberOfCards, thus accessing a card in another market         _transferCard(ownerOf(_card), address(this), _card); // contract becomes final resting place         nfthub.withdrawWithMetadata(_tokenId);         emit LogNftUpgraded(_card, _tokenId);     }    ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the following to ownerOf: require(_card < numberOfCards, "Card does not exist");
