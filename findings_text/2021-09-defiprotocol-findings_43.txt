# Handle  kenzo   # Vulnerability details  When using few times an unchanging value from external contract call, the result can be saved and used without recalling the external contract.  ## Impact Some gas can be saved.  ## Proof of Concept In settleAuction, the basket's totalSupply stays constant through the loop's iterations. ``` for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {             uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;             require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);         } ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L97  ## Tools Used Manual analysis, hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Save basketAsERC20.totalSupply() to a local variable outside the loop, and use that variable inside the loop.
