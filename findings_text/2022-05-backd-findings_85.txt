Also there will be a problem with a rewarding system in LpGauge.sol so that some normal users wouldn't get rewards properly.   ## Proof of Concept 1. Strategy A staked amount x and x will be added to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked. contracts\StakerVault.sol#L312 2. Strategy A transferred the amount x to non-strategy B and StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault._poolTotalStaked won't be updated. contracts\StakerVault.sol#L111 3. After some time for the larger LpGauge.poolStakedIntegral, B claims rewards using the LpGauge.claimRewards() function. contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L52  Inside LpGauge.userCheckPoint(), it's designed not to calculate LpGauge.perUserShare for strategy, but it will pass this condition because B is not a strategy. contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L90  Furthermore, when calculate rewards, LpGauge.poolStakedIntegral will be calculated larger than a normal user stakes same amount. It's because StakerVault._poolTotalStaked wasn't updated when A transfers x amount to B so LpGauge.poolTotalStaked is less than correct value. contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L113-L117  Finally B can get more rewards than he should and the reward system will pay more rewards than it's designed.   ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think there will be two methods to fix. Method 1 is to forbid a transfer between strategy and non-strategy so that strategy can't move funds to non-strategy. Method 2 is to update StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked and StakerVault._poolTotalStaked correctly so that strategy won't claim more rewards than he should even though he claims rewards using non-strategy.  Method 1. You need to modify two functions. StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().  1. You need to add this require() at L112 for transfer(). require(strategies[msg.sender] == strategies[account], Error.FAILED_TRANSFER);  2. You need to add this require() at L144 for transferFrom(). require(strategies[src] == strategies[dst], Error.FAILED_TRANSFER);  Method 2. I've explained about this method in my medium risk report "StakerVault.unstake(), StakerVault.unstakeFor() would revert with a uint underflow error of StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault._poolTotalStaked" I will copy the same code for your convenience.  You need to modify 3 functions. StakerVault.addStrategy(), StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().  1. You need to move staked amount from StakerVault._poolTotalStaked to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked every time when StakerVault.inflationManager approves a new strategy. You can modify addStrategy() at L98-L102 like this.  function addStrategy(address strategy) external override returns (bool) {     require(msg.sender == address(inflationManager), Error.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS);     require(!strategies[strategy], Error.ADDRESS_ALREADY_SET);      strategies[strategy] = true;     _poolTotalStaked -= balances[strategy];     strategiesTotalStaked += balances[strategy];      return true; }  2. You need to add below code at L126 of transfer() function.  if(strategies[msg.sender] != strategies[account]) {     if(strategies[msg.sender]) { // from strategy to non-strategy         _poolTotalStaked += amount;         strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;     }     else { // from non-strategy to strategy         _poolTotalStaked -= amount;         strategiesTotalStaked += amount;     } }  3. You need to add below code at L170 of transferFrom() function.  if(strategies[src] != strategies[dst]) {     if(strategies[src]) { // from strategy to non-strategy         _poolTotalStaked += amount;         strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;     }     else { // from non-strategy to strategy         _poolTotalStaked -= amount;         strategiesTotalStaked += amount;     } }
