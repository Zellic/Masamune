So when users redeem their long/short tokens, the total amount of collateral tokens will be the same as the amount that users transferred during mint().  Btw in `setFinalLongPayout()`, there is no validation that this function can't be called twice and the below scenario would be possible.  1. Let's assume there is one user `Bob` in the market for simplicity. 2. `Bob` transferred 100 amounts of `collateral` and got 100 long/short tokens. The market has 100 `collateral`. 3. The market admin set `finalLongPayout = 60 * 1e16` and `Bob` redeemed 100 `longToken` and received 60 `collateral`. The market has 40 `collateral` now. 4. After that, the admin realized `finalLongPayout` is too high and changed `finalLongPayout = 40 * 1e16` again. 5. `Bob` tries to redeem 100 `shortToken` and receive 60 `collateral` but the market can't offer as it has 40 `collateral` only.  When there are several users in the market, some users can't redeem their long/short tokens as the market doesn't have enough `collaterals`.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We should modify `setFinalLongPayout()` like below so it can't be finalized twice.  ```solidity   function setFinalLongPayout(uint256 _finalLongPayout) external override onlyOwner {      require(finalLongPayout > MAX_PAYOUT, "Finalized already"); //++++++++++++++++++++++++      require(_finalLongPayout >= floorLongPayout, "Payout cannot be below floor");     require(_finalLongPayout <= ceilingLongPayout, "Payout cannot exceed ceiling");     finalLongPayout = _finalLongPayout;     emit FinalLongPayoutSet(_finalLongPayout);   } ```
