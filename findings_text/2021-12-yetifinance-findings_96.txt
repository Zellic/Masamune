# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  On calling with arrays of different lengths various malfunctions are possible as the arrays are used as given. `withdrawColl` outcome will not be as expected by a caller.  ## Proof of Concept  `_adjustTrove` doesn't check for array lengths and all other array providing usages of this function do check them before usage.  BorrowerOperations.withdrawColl doesn't: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol#L373  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the check:  Now: ``` params._collsOut = _collsOut; params._amountsOut = _amountsOut; ```  To be: ``` require(_collsOut.length == _amountsOut.length); params._collsOut = _collsOut; params._amountsOut = _amountsOut; ```
