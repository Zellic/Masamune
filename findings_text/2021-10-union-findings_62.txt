# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `AssetManager.withdraw` function iterates through the markets based on the `withdrawSeq` array field. This field must be manually set to cover all markets on each new market addition.  ## Impact It could be that a market is added but this array is not updated. Thus not all markets are iterated and users might not be able to withdraw their entire `amount` as the new market is skipped  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Ensure that `withdrawSeq` is always up-to-date when `addAdapter` is called, for example, `addAdapter` could add the new adapter as the last element to `withdrawSeq` until it's manually set through `changeWithdrawSequence`.
