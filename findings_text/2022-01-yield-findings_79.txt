# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  L116 of Cvx3CrvOracle enforces for the rest of the function call that `base == ethId <-> quote == cvx3CrvId`  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/Cvx3CrvOracle.sol#L116  However on L137 we check both these conditions again.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/Cvx3CrvOracle.sol#L137  We could check just one of these and then rely on the require condition on 116 to enforce the other one. This will prevent us having to SLOAD `ethID` again  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change L137 to `if (base == cvx3CrvId) {`
