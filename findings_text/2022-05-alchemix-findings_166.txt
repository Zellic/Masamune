In the same contract, there is the function `lowerHasMinted()` with the same permission level as mint and is thus callable by the same user as well. ```solidity   function lowerHasMinted(uint256 amount) external onlyWhitelisted {     totalMinted[msg.sender] = totalMinted[msg.sender] - amount;   } ```  It is clear that a user can accumulate an infinite (within supply) amount of AlTokens by calling `lowerHasMinted()` before any action that would make them exceed their minting cap.  ## Tools Used Manual review, VScode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the permissioning on `lowerHasMinted()` to be restricted to a higher permissioned role like `onlySentinel()` , or deprecate this function as I could not find any uses of it throughout the codebase or in tests.
