# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  Solidity division rounds down, so doing `M / 2 <= N` checks mean that `M` can be at most `2N + 1`.  This affects the following checks:  ```jsx require(  (_tokenURIs.length / 2) <= cardLimit,  "Too many tokens to mint" );  require(   _cardAffiliateAddresses.length == 0 ||    _cardAffiliateAddresses.length == (_tokenURIs.length / 2),   "Card Affiliate Length Error" ) ```  Note that with the current implementation, if `_tokenURIs` is of odd length, its last element will be  redundant, but market creation will not revert.  The stricter checks will partially mitigate `_tokenURIs` having odd length because `_cardAffiliateAddresses` is now required to be exactly twice that of `_tokenURIs`.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  These checks should be modified to   ```jsx require(  _tokenURIs.length <= cardLimit * 2,  "Too many tokens to mint" );  require(   _cardAffiliateAddresses.length == 0 ||    _cardAffiliateAddresses.length * 2 == _tokenURIs.length,   "Card Affiliate Length Error" ); ```  In addition, consider adding a check for `_tokenURIs` to strictly be of even length.  `require(_tokenURIs.length % 2 == 0, "TokenURI Length Error");`
