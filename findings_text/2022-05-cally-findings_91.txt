This will most likely pose problems on the front-end of the Cally protocol because there will be a ridiculously high number of malicious vaults displayed to actual users.  I define these vaults as malicious because it is possible that a user accidently buys a call on this vault which provides 0 value in return. Overall, the presence of zero-amount vaults is damaging to Cally's product image and functionality.  ## Proof of Concept - User calls `createVault(0,,,,);` with an ERC20 type. - There is no validation that `amount > 0` - Function will complete successfully, granting the new vault NFT to the caller. - Cally protocol is filled with unwanted 0 amount vaults.  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the simple check `require(tokenIdOrAmount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");`
