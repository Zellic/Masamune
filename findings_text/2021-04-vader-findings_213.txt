# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `Router.getAnchorPrice` sorts the `arrayPrices` array and always returns the third element `_sortedAnchorFeed[2]`. This only returns the median if `_sortedAnchorFeed` is of length 5, but it can be anything from `0` to `anchorLimit`.  ## Impact  If not enough anchors are listed initially, it might become out-of-bounds and break all contract functionality due to revert, or return a wrong median. If `anchorLimit` is set to a different value than 5, it's also wrong.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check the length of `_sortedAnchorFeed` and return `_sortedAnchorFeed[_sortedAnchorFeed.length / 2]` if it's odd, or the average of the two in the middle if it's even.
