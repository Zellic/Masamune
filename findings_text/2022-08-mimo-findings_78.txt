Owners can only /// have one proxy at a time. But it is not. There are multiple problems: 1) Proxy owner can change and will not be registered 2) There many ways for an owner to have many proxies: - a few other proxy owners transfeOwnership() to one address - Registry tracks last deployments and does not guarantee ownership - Factory.sol allows calling deployFor() to anyone, without any checks and registrations  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-mimo/blob/eb1a5016b69f72bc1e4fd3600a65e908bd228f13/contracts/proxy/MIMOProxyFactory.sol#L40-L58 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-mimo/blob/eb1a5016b69f72bc1e4fd3600a65e908bd228f13/contracts/proxy/MIMOProxyRegistry.sol#L39-L59  ## Tools Used Hardhat  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Delete Proxy.transfetOwnership() Disallow anyone to call deploy() and deployFor() in Factory()
