GOLOM uses OZ's implementation of ERC20 which doesn't allow tokens to be sent to address(0). Because the "owner" of the burned NFT is address(0) multiStakerClaim will always revert when called for a burned NFT trapping rewards in contract forever.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Implement a clawback clause inside the multiStakerClaim function. If the token is burned (i.e. owned by address(0)) the rewards should be transferred to different address. These rewards could be claimed to the treasury or burned, etc.           if (tokenowner == address(0){             rewardToken.transfer(treasury, reward);             weth.transfer(treasury, rewardEth);         }
