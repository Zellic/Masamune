# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  As `NOTE` continues to be staked in the `sNOTE` contract, it is important that Notional's governance is able to correctly handle on-chain voting by calculating the relative power `sNOTE` has in terms of its equivalent `NOTE` amount.   `getVotingPower` is a useful function in tracking the relative voting power a staker has, however, it does not utilise any checkpointing mechanism to ensure the user's voting power is a snapshot of a specific block number. As a result, it would be possible to manipulate a user's voting power by casting a vote on-chain and then have them transfer their `sNOTE` to another account to then vote again.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L271-L293 ``` function getVotingPower(uint256 sNOTEAmount) public view returns (uint256) {     // Gets the BPT token price (in ETH)     uint256 bptPrice = IPriceOracle(address(BALANCER_POOL_TOKEN)).getLatest(IPriceOracle.Variable.BPT_PRICE);     // Gets the NOTE token price (in ETH)     uint256 notePrice = IPriceOracle(address(BALANCER_POOL_TOKEN)).getLatest(IPriceOracle.Variable.PAIR_PRICE);          // Since both bptPrice and notePrice are denominated in ETH, we can use     // this formula to calculate noteAmount     // bptBalance * bptPrice = notePrice * noteAmount     // noteAmount = bptPrice/notePrice * bptBalance     uint256 priceRatio = bptPrice * 1e18 / notePrice;     uint256 bptBalance = BALANCER_POOL_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));      // Amount_note = Price_NOTE_per_BPT * BPT_supply * 80% (80/20 pool)     uint256 noteAmount = priceRatio * bptBalance * 80 / 100;      // Reduce precision down to 1e8 (NOTE token)     // priceRatio and bptBalance are both 1e18 (1e36 total)     // we divide by 1e28 to get to 1e8     noteAmount /= 1e28;      return (noteAmount * sNOTEAmount) / totalSupply(); } ```  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider implementing a `getPriorVotingPower` function which takes in a `blockNumber` argument and returns the correct balance at that specific block.
