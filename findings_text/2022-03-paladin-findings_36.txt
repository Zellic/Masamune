# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L729   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact If `startDropPerSecond` is initialized at less than `endDropPerSecond` the contract will be unusable. There will be an underflow in `_updateDropPerSecond` which will always revert. This function is called throughout the contract, in critical functions like `lock` and `claim`, if it were to always revert the contract would be broken and unusable.  ## Proof of Concept If `startDropPerSecond` is initialized at less than `endDropPerSecond` in the constructor, the contract will be deployed without issue but will be broken.  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check in the constructor that ensures `startDropPerSecond` >= `endDropPerSecond`
