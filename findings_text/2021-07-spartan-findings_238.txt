# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `getPoolShareWeight` function returns a user's pool share weight by calculating how many SPARTAN the user's LP tokens account for. However, this approach is vulnerable to flash loan manipulation since an attacker can swap a large number of TOKEN to SPARTAN to increase the number of SPARTAN in the pool, thus effectively increasing his pool share weight.  ## Proof of Concept  According to the implementation of `getPoolShareWeight,` a user's pool share weight is calculated by `uints * baseAmount / totalSupply`, where `uints` is the number of user's LP tokens, `totalSupply` is the total supply of LP tokens, and `baseAmount` is the number of SPARTAN in the pool. Thus, a user's pool share weight is proportional to the number of SPARTAN in the pool. Consider the following attack scenario:  1. Supposing the attacked pool is SPARTAN-WBNB. The attacker first prepares some LP tokens (WBNB-SPP) by adding liquidity to the pool. 2. The attacker then swaps a large number of WBNB to SPARTAN, which increases the pool's `baseAmount`. He could split his trade into small amounts to reduce slip-based fees. 3. The attacker now wants to increase his weight in the `DaoVault`. He adds his LP tokens to the pool by calling the `deposit` function of `Dao.` 4. `Dao` then calls `depositLP` of `DaoVault`, causing the attacker's weight to be recalculated. Due to the large proportion of SPARTAN in the pool, the attacker's weight is artificially increased. 5. With a higher member weight, the attacker can, for example, vote the current proposal with more votes than he should have or obtain more rewards when calling `harvest` of the `Dao` contract. 6. The attacker then swaps back SPARTAN to WBNB and only loses the slip-based fees.

This would prevent the attacker from launching the attack since there is typically no guarantee that he could arbitrage the WBNB back in the next block.
