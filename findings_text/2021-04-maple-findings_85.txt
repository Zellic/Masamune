# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `ChainlinkOracle.setManualPrice` function specifies that it can only be called "if manualOverride == true".  This is not the case.   ## Impact  Assume an oracle failure happened, and the oracle needs to be manually set to prevent losses. The `setManualPrice` function succeeds and the owner might think that the oracle price is overwritten as the function would fail when `manualOverride` is not `true` according to specification. The protocol would still use the broken chainlink price feed and suffer losses.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the missing `require(manualOverride == true, "manual override not set")` check.
