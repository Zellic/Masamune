The delegated user can further increase this power by increasing the time that the delegated funds are locked by calling `increaseUnlockTime`, resulting in ALL the delegated funds controlled by the delegated user, including those that do not originate from the delegated user, being used to increase the voting power of the user.  The issue lies in the following scenario: If user A delegates to user B, and then user B delegates to user C, user B loses the ability to extend his or her voting power by `increaseUnlockTime` due to a missing `_checkpoint` operation. If user B calls the `increaseUnlockTime` function, the `_checkpoint` operation will not proceed, as user B is delegating to user C. However, B still owns delegated funds, in the form of the funds delegated from user A. Therefore, user B should still gain voting power from `increaseUnlockTime`, even though user B is delegating.  #### PoC / Attack Scenario  Assume three users, Alice, Bob, and Carol, who each possess `locks` with 10 units of `delegate` value. Also assume that the unlock time is 1 week.  + Alice delegates her 10 units to Bob. + Bob then delegates his 10 units to Carol. + At this point, Alice has 0 `delegate`, value, Bob has 10 `delegate` value, and Carol has 20 `delegate` value. + Carol calls `increaseUnlockTime` to 2 weeks, resulting in `_checkpoint` raising her voting power accordingly. + Bob calls `increaseUnlockTime` to 2 weeks, resulting in no change in his voting power, even though he has 10 units of `delegate` value.   #### Suggested Fix  Move the `_checkpoint` outside of the `if` statement on line 514.  ---

The result is if we try to get `balanceOf` or `totalSupply` at current block number, it just return wrong value because values of `globalEpoch` is overrided.  ## Proof of Concept  [Line 257-264](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/fece3bdb79ccacb501099c24b60312cd0b2e4bb2/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L257-L264) ```solidity if (uEpoch == 0) {     userPointHistory[_addr][uEpoch + 1] = userOldPoint; }  userPointEpoch[_addr] = uEpoch + 1; userNewPoint.ts = block.timestamp; userNewPoint.blk = block.number; userPointHistory[_addr][uEpoch + 1] = userNewPoint; ```  When `uEpoch == 0`, values of `userPointHistory` with `index = uEpoch + 1` is updated to `userOldPoint` but in line 264, values of `userPointHistory` with `index = uEpoch + 1` is overrided to `userNewPoint` which basically makes line 257-259 has no meaning.  Similarly issue with value of `pointHistory[epoch]` in [line 372](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/fece3bdb79ccacb501099c24b60312cd0b2e4bb2/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L372)  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update logic of `_checkpoint()`, for example, use `++` operator to make sure `epoch` is increased each time it appends new element.

But in case 1, sender’s lock was not delegated to another, the sender can delegate to new address with end time of lock equal to new end time. After that he can call `increaseUnlockTime()` and move to case 2. Then sender can undelegate and the lock will be extended, and sender will take back vote power.  Here is the script : ``` typescript= describe("voting escrow", async () => {     it("increase unlock time issue", async () => {       await createSnapshot(provider);       //alice creates lock       let lockTime = WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(alice).createLock(lockAmount, lockTime);       // bob creates lock       lockTime = 50 * WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(bob).createLock(10 ** 8, lockTime);       //pass 1 week, alice's lock is expired       await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [await getTimestamp() + WEEK]);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.eq(0);       //alice can not increase unlock timme       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.be.revertedWith("Lock expired");       //alice delegate to bob then can increase unlock time       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(bob.address);       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.not.be.reverted;       //alice delegate back herself       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(alice.address);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.gt(0);     }); ```  ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In every cases, expired locks should able to be extended -> should remove line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L511

In the given CheckpointMath.md file it is stated that checkpoint details for  **increaseUnlockTime** function should be :  |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | owner.end  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    BUT with this error  you get a different checkpoint details :   |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | T  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    The error is illustrated in the code below :  ```         LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];         uint256 unlock_time = _floorToWeek(_unlockTime); // Locktime is rounded down to weeks         /* @audit comment                  the unlock_time represent the newLock end time         */         // Validate inputs         require(locked_.amount > 0, "No lock");         require(unlock_time > locked_.end, "Only increase lock end");         require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, "Exceeds maxtime");         // Update lock         uint256 oldUnlockTime = locked_.end;         locked_.end = unlock_time;         /* @audit comment                  The locked_ end time is update from  oldUnlockTime  ==>  unlock_time         */         locked[msg.sender] = locked_;         if (locked_.delegatee == msg.sender) {             // Undelegated lock             require(oldUnlockTime > block.timestamp, "Lock expired");             LockedBalance memory oldLocked = _copyLock(locked_);             oldLocked.end = unlock_time;             /* @audit comment                  The oldLocked.end is set to unlock_time instead of   oldUnlockTime              */             _checkpoint(msg.sender, oldLocked, locked_);         } ```  The impact of this is when calculating the **userOldPoint.bias** in the **_checkpoint** function you get an incorrect value equal to **userNewPoint.bias** (because oldLocked.end == _newLocked.end which is wrong).  ``` 240        userOldPoint.bias = 241                    userOldPoint.slope * 242                    int128(int256(_oldLocked.end - block.timestamp)); ```  The wrong **userOldPoint.bias** value is later used to calculate and update the bias value for the new point in **PointHistory**.   ``` 359       lastPoint.bias = 360                  lastPoint.bias + 361                  userNewPoint.bias - 362                  userOldPoint.bias;  372       pointHistory[epoch] = lastPoint; ```  And added to that the wrong **oldLocked.end** is used to get oldSlopeDelta value which is used to update the **slopeChanges**.  ``` 271       oldSlopeDelta = slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end];  380       oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta + userOldPoint.slope; 381       if (_newLocked.end == _oldLocked.end) { 382                  oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta - userNewPoint.slope; // It was a new deposit, not extension 383        } 384       slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end] = oldSlopeDelta; ```   As the **PointHistory** and the **slopeChanges** values are used inside the functions **balanceOfAt()** ,  **_supplyAt()**,  **totalSupply()**,  **totalSupplyAt()** to calculate the voting power, THIS ERROR COULD GIVE WRONG VOTING POWER AT A GIVEN BLOCK OF A USER OR CAN GIVE WRONG TOTAL VOTING POWER.  ## Tools Used  Manual Audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The line 513 in the VotingEscrow.sol contract :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = unlock_time; ```  Need to be replaced with the following :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = oldUnlockTime; ```

This could cause the entire system to break down as the incentives don't work any more.  ## Exploit Method This exploit only works if a user is able to use the system and reliably get themselves blocked. Blocking policies are not in scope, so I am assuming there would be a list of bannable offences, and thus this condition could be fulfilled. Consider a user with two accounts, called Rider and Horse. Rider has 100,000 tokens. Horse has 1 token. Rider is a smart contract (required for an account to be bannable). Rider locks for 1 week. Horse locks for 52 weeks. Rider delegates to Horse. Horse can continue to extend its lock period and enjoy the maximised voting power. Whenever the user wants their tokens back, they simply need to get the Rider account blocked. When Rider is blocked, `Blocklist.block(RiderAddress)` is called, which in turn calls `ve.forceUndelegate(RiderAddress)`. Rider is now an undelegated account with an expired lock. It can call `ve.withdraw()` to get its tokens back. The user can repeat this process with a fresh account taking the role of Rider.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps `forceUndelegate()` could be made to set `locked_.end = fromLocked.end`. This would mean that blocked users are still locked into the system for the period they delegated for. However, this does have the downside of tokens being locked in the system without the full rights of the system which other users enjoy. Alternatively, this might be addressable through not blocking users that seem to be doing this, but of course that might have other undersirable consequences.  ## Proof of Concept ```diff diff --git a/test/votingEscrowTest.ts b/test/votingEscrowBlockMeTest.ts index 7d3163d..ed27155 100644 --- a/test/votingEscrowTest.ts +++ b/test/votingEscrowBlockMeTest.ts @@ -25,7 +25,7 @@ describe("VotingEscrow Tests", function () {    let fdtMock: MockERC20;

The delegated user can further increase this power by increasing the time that the delegated funds are locked by calling `increaseUnlockTime`, resulting in ALL the delegated funds controlled by the delegated user, including those that do not originate from the delegated user, being used to increase the voting power of the user.  The issue lies in the following scenario: If user A delegates to user B, and then user B delegates to user C, user B loses the ability to extend his or her voting power by `increaseUnlockTime` due to a missing `_checkpoint` operation. If user B calls the `increaseUnlockTime` function, the `_checkpoint` operation will not proceed, as user B is delegating to user C. However, B still owns delegated funds, in the form of the funds delegated from user A. Therefore, user B should still gain voting power from `increaseUnlockTime`, even though user B is delegating.  #### PoC / Attack Scenario  Assume three users, Alice, Bob, and Carol, who each possess `locks` with 10 units of `delegate` value. Also assume that the unlock time is 1 week.  + Alice delegates her 10 units to Bob. + Bob then delegates his 10 units to Carol. + At this point, Alice has 0 `delegate`, value, Bob has 10 `delegate` value, and Carol has 20 `delegate` value. + Carol calls `increaseUnlockTime` to 2 weeks, resulting in `_checkpoint` raising her voting power accordingly. + Bob calls `increaseUnlockTime` to 2 weeks, resulting in no change in his voting power, even though he has 10 units of `delegate` value.   #### Suggested Fix  Move the `_checkpoint` outside of the `if` statement on line 514.  ---

The result is if we try to get `balanceOf` or `totalSupply` at current block number, it just return wrong value because values of `globalEpoch` is overrided.  ## Proof of Concept  [Line 257-264](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/fece3bdb79ccacb501099c24b60312cd0b2e4bb2/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L257-L264) ```solidity if (uEpoch == 0) {     userPointHistory[_addr][uEpoch + 1] = userOldPoint; }  userPointEpoch[_addr] = uEpoch + 1; userNewPoint.ts = block.timestamp; userNewPoint.blk = block.number; userPointHistory[_addr][uEpoch + 1] = userNewPoint; ```  When `uEpoch == 0`, values of `userPointHistory` with `index = uEpoch + 1` is updated to `userOldPoint` but in line 264, values of `userPointHistory` with `index = uEpoch + 1` is overrided to `userNewPoint` which basically makes line 257-259 has no meaning.  Similarly issue with value of `pointHistory[epoch]` in [line 372](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/fece3bdb79ccacb501099c24b60312cd0b2e4bb2/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L372)  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update logic of `_checkpoint()`, for example, use `++` operator to make sure `epoch` is increased each time it appends new element.

But in case 1, sender’s lock was not delegated to another, the sender can delegate to new address with end time of lock equal to new end time. After that he can call `increaseUnlockTime()` and move to case 2. Then sender can undelegate and the lock will be extended, and sender will take back vote power.  Here is the script : ``` typescript= describe("voting escrow", async () => {     it("increase unlock time issue", async () => {       await createSnapshot(provider);       //alice creates lock       let lockTime = WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(alice).createLock(lockAmount, lockTime);       // bob creates lock       lockTime = 50 * WEEK + (await getTimestamp());       await ve.connect(bob).createLock(10 ** 8, lockTime);       //pass 1 week, alice's lock is expired       await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [await getTimestamp() + WEEK]);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.eq(0);       //alice can not increase unlock timme       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.be.revertedWith("Lock expired");       //alice delegate to bob then can increase unlock time       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(bob.address);       await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.not.be.reverted;       //alice delegate back herself       await ve.connect(alice).delegate(alice.address);       expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.gt(0);     }); ```  ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In every cases, expired locks should able to be extended -> should remove line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L511

In the given CheckpointMath.md file it is stated that checkpoint details for  **increaseUnlockTime** function should be :  |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | owner.end  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    BUT with this error  you get a different checkpoint details :   |  Lock | amount | end |  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| | old   | owner.delegated  | T  |   | new  | owner.delegated  | T |    The error is illustrated in the code below :  ```         LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];         uint256 unlock_time = _floorToWeek(_unlockTime); // Locktime is rounded down to weeks         /* @audit comment                  the unlock_time represent the newLock end time         */         // Validate inputs         require(locked_.amount > 0, "No lock");         require(unlock_time > locked_.end, "Only increase lock end");         require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, "Exceeds maxtime");         // Update lock         uint256 oldUnlockTime = locked_.end;         locked_.end = unlock_time;         /* @audit comment                  The locked_ end time is update from  oldUnlockTime  ==>  unlock_time         */         locked[msg.sender] = locked_;         if (locked_.delegatee == msg.sender) {             // Undelegated lock             require(oldUnlockTime > block.timestamp, "Lock expired");             LockedBalance memory oldLocked = _copyLock(locked_);             oldLocked.end = unlock_time;             /* @audit comment                  The oldLocked.end is set to unlock_time instead of   oldUnlockTime              */             _checkpoint(msg.sender, oldLocked, locked_);         } ```  The impact of this is when calculating the **userOldPoint.bias** in the **_checkpoint** function you get an incorrect value equal to **userNewPoint.bias** (because oldLocked.end == _newLocked.end which is wrong).  ``` 240        userOldPoint.bias = 241                    userOldPoint.slope * 242                    int128(int256(_oldLocked.end - block.timestamp)); ```  The wrong **userOldPoint.bias** value is later used to calculate and update the bias value for the new point in **PointHistory**.   ``` 359       lastPoint.bias = 360                  lastPoint.bias + 361                  userNewPoint.bias - 362                  userOldPoint.bias;  372       pointHistory[epoch] = lastPoint; ```  And added to that the wrong **oldLocked.end** is used to get oldSlopeDelta value which is used to update the **slopeChanges**.  ``` 271       oldSlopeDelta = slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end];  380       oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta + userOldPoint.slope; 381       if (_newLocked.end == _oldLocked.end) { 382                  oldSlopeDelta = oldSlopeDelta - userNewPoint.slope; // It was a new deposit, not extension 383        } 384       slopeChanges[_oldLocked.end] = oldSlopeDelta; ```   As the **PointHistory** and the **slopeChanges** values are used inside the functions **balanceOfAt()** ,  **_supplyAt()**,  **totalSupply()**,  **totalSupplyAt()** to calculate the voting power, THIS ERROR COULD GIVE WRONG VOTING POWER AT A GIVEN BLOCK OF A USER OR CAN GIVE WRONG TOTAL VOTING POWER.  ## Tools Used  Manual Audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The line 513 in the VotingEscrow.sol contract :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = unlock_time; ```  Need to be replaced with the following :  ```       513      oldLocked.end = oldUnlockTime; ```

This could cause the entire system to break down as the incentives don't work any more.  ## Exploit Method This exploit only works if a user is able to use the system and reliably get themselves blocked. Blocking policies are not in scope, so I am assuming there would be a list of bannable offences, and thus this condition could be fulfilled. Consider a user with two accounts, called Rider and Horse. Rider has 100,000 tokens. Horse has 1 token. Rider is a smart contract (required for an account to be bannable). Rider locks for 1 week. Horse locks for 52 weeks. Rider delegates to Horse. Horse can continue to extend its lock period and enjoy the maximised voting power. Whenever the user wants their tokens back, they simply need to get the Rider account blocked. When Rider is blocked, `Blocklist.block(RiderAddress)` is called, which in turn calls `ve.forceUndelegate(RiderAddress)`. Rider is now an undelegated account with an expired lock. It can call `ve.withdraw()` to get its tokens back. The user can repeat this process with a fresh account taking the role of Rider.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps `forceUndelegate()` could be made to set `locked_.end = fromLocked.end`. This would mean that blocked users are still locked into the system for the period they delegated for. However, this does have the downside of tokens being locked in the system without the full rights of the system which other users enjoy. Alternatively, this might be addressable through not blocking users that seem to be doing this, but of course that might have other undersirable consequences.  ## Proof of Concept ```diff diff --git a/test/votingEscrowTest.ts b/test/votingEscrowBlockMeTest.ts index 7d3163d..ed27155 100644 --- a/test/votingEscrowTest.ts +++ b/test/votingEscrowBlockMeTest.ts @@ -25,7 +25,7 @@ describe("VotingEscrow Tests", function () {    let fdtMock: MockERC20;
