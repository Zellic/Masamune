# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The minAmount <= amount check in _prepareForWithdrawalSingle() is an unnecessary check because the same check has already passed in both lg.withdrawSingleByLiquidity and lg.withdrawSingleByExchange. And there is no logic that changes the checked parameters between the earlier checks and this one.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/WithdrawHandler.sol#L361  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L224  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L268   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove unnecessary check.
