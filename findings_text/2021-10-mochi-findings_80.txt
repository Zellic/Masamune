# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details   ## Impact [MochiVaultFactory.sol#L26-L37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVaultFactory.sol#L26-L37) There's no permission control in the vaultFactory. Anyone can create a vault. The transaction would be reverted when the government tries to deploy such an asset.  As the protocol checks whether the vault is a valid vault by comparing the contract's address with the computed address, the protocol would recognize the random vault as a valid one.    I consider this is a medium-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept  Here's a web3.py script to trigger the bug. ```py vault_factory.functions.deployVault(usdt.address).transact() ## this tx would be reverted profile.functions.registerAssetByGov([usdt.address], [3]).transact() ```  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend to add a check. ```solidity require(msg.sender == engine, "!engine"); ```
