# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  killAuction() is missing a require() to check that auctionOngoing == true before setting it to false. While currently, the caller publishNewIndex() in Basket has this condition checked, any other usages may accidentally call this when auction is not ongoing.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L43-L45  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L175-L187  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add require(auctionOngoing == true)
