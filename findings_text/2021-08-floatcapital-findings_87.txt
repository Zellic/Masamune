# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Changing a function’s visibility from public to external can save gas by avoiding the unnecessary copying of data to memory. Function stakeFromUser() in Staker.sol is only called from SyntheticTokens.sol and not from within the contract itself which means this can be made external.   ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-floatcapital/blob/bd419abf68e775103df6e40d8f0e8d40156c2f81/contracts/contracts/Staker.sol#L839  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-floatcapital/blob/bd419abf68e775103df6e40d8f0e8d40156c2f81/contracts/contracts/SyntheticToken.sol#L56   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change function visibility to external where possible.
