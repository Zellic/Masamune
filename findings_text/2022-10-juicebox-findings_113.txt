Since the return statement doesn't check that _numberReservedTokensMintable >= _reserveTokensMinted, it will revert under those circumstances. The issue is that there are legitimate circumstances in which this becomes false. If a tier is fully minted then all reserve tokens are mintable. When the tier begins to redeem, _numberReservedTokensMintable will fall under _reserveTokensMinted, permanently breaking minting and redeeming. Minting is broken because all mint functions directly call _numberOfReservedTokensOutstandingFor. Redeeming is broken because the redeem callback (JB721Delegate#redeemParams) calls _totalRedemtionWeight which calls _numberOfReservedTokensOutstandingFor.   Example:  A tier has a reserveRate of 100 (1/100 tokens reserved) and an initialQuantity of 10000. We assume that the tier has been fully minted, that is, _reserveTokensMinted is 100 and remainingQuantity = 0. Now we begin burning the tokens. Let's run through the lines above after 100 tokens have been burned (remainingQuantity = 100):  _numberOfNonReservedMinted = 10000 - 100 - 100 = 9800  _numerator = 9800 * 100 = 980000  _numberReservedTokensMintable = 980000 / 10000 = 98  Since _numberReservedTokensMintable < _reserveTokensMinted the line will underflow and revert.  JBTiered721DelegateStore#_numberOfReservedTokensOutstandingFor will now revert every time it is called. This affects all minting functions as well as totalRedemptionWeight. Since those functions now revert when called, it is impossible to mint or redeem anymore NFTs.  ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a check before returning:      +   if (_reserveTokensMinted > _numberReservedTokensMintable) {     +       return 0;     +   }          return _numberReservedTokensMintable - _reserveTokensMinted;
