If it's still in use, any top up action executions will be disabled as reporting fees in `KeeperGauge.sol` will revert: ``` function reportFees(     address beneficiary,     uint256 amount,     address lpTokenAddress ) external override returns (bool) {     ...     require(!killed, Error.CONTRACT_PAUSED); // gauge is killed by InflationManager     ...     return true; } ``` If this happened during extreme market movements, some positions that require a top up will not be executed and be in risk of being liquidated.  ## Proof of Concept - Alice registers a top up action. - Governance calls `InflationManager.removeKeeperGauge`, replacing an old keeper gauge. However, governance forgot to call `TopUpActionFeeHandler.prepareKeeperGauge` so `TopUpActionFeeHandler.getKeeperGauge` still points to the killed gauge. - Market moved and Alice's position should now be executed by keepers, however any attempt to execute will revert:     ```     > Keeper calls TopUpAction.execute();     > _payFees();     > IActionFeeHandler(feeHandler).payFees();     > IKeeperGauge(keeperGauge).reportFees();     > reverts as gauge is already killed     ``` - Governance noticed and calls `prepareKeeperGauge`  with a 3 days delay. - Alice's position got liquidated before the change is executed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adding an on-chain check to ensure that the keeper gauge is not in use before removing them.
