# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The method `purchaseMembership` in `FSDNetwork` contract contains the code below. Inside this method, we are constantly reading from the mapping `membership`, so why not use just one read `Membership userMembership = membership[msg.sender]` and use this instance for everything related to memberships.  Each read we are currently doing has an impact on the gas cost.  ``` function purchaseMembership(uint256 costShareBenefit) external {         require(             costShareBenefit % 10 ether == 0 && costShareBenefit > 0,             "FSDNetwork::purchaseMembership: Invalid cost share benefit specified"         );          if (             membership[msg.sender].creation + MEMBERSHIP_DURATION <             block.timestamp         ) {             membership[msg.sender].creation = 0;             membership[msg.sender].availableCostShareBenefits = 0;         }          uint256 totalCostShareBenefit =             membership[msg.sender].availableCostShareBenefits.add(                 costShareBenefit             );         require(             totalCostShareBenefit <= getMaximumBenefitPerUser(),             "FSDNetwork::purchaseMembership: Exceeds cost share benefit limit per account"         );          totalCostShareBenefits = totalCostShareBenefits.add(costShareBenefit);          // FSHARE = Total Available Cost Share Benefits / Gearing Factor         uint256 fShare = totalCostShareBenefits / GEARING_FACTOR;         // Floor of 7500 ETH         if (fShare < 7500 ether) fShare = 7500 ether;          // FSHARERatio = Capital Pool / FSHARE (scaled by 1e18)         uint256 fShareRatio =             (fsd.getReserveBalance() - totalOpenRequests).mul(1 ether) / fShare;          // 1 ether = 100%         require(             fShareRatio >= 1 ether,             "FSDNetwork::purchaseMembership: Insufficient Capital to Cover Membership"         );          uint256 membershipFee = costShareBenefit.wmul(MEMBERSHIP_FEE);         uint256 fsdSpotPrice = getFSDPrice();         uint256 fsdFee = membershipFee.wdiv(fsdSpotPrice);          // Automatically locks 65% to the Network by disallowing its retrieval         fsd.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), fsdFee);          if (membership[msg.sender].creation == 0) {             membership[msg.sender]                 .availableCostShareBenefits = totalCostShareBenefit;             membership[msg.sender].creation = block.timestamp;             membership[msg.sender].gracePeriod =                 membership[msg.sender].creation +                 MEMBERSHIP_DURATION +                 60 days;         } else {             membership[msg.sender]                 .availableCostShareBenefits = totalCostShareBenefit;              uint256 elapsedDurationPercentage =                 ((block.timestamp - membership[msg.sender].creation) *                     1 ether) / MEMBERSHIP_DURATION;             if (elapsedDurationPercentage < 1 ether) {                 uint256 durationIncrease =                     (costShareBenefit.mul(1 ether) /                         (totalCostShareBenefit - costShareBenefit))                         .mul(MEMBERSHIP_DURATION) / 1 ether;                 membership[msg.sender].creation += durationIncrease;             }         }          uint256 governancePoolRewards =             fsdFee.wmul(GOVERNANCE_FUNDING_POOL_REWARDS);          // Staking Rewards = 20% + [FSHARERatio - 125%] (if FSHARERatio > 125%)         uint256 stakingMultiplier =             fShareRatio >= 1.25 ether                 ?
