# Handle  csanuragjain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact unlockTime is set incorrectly  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to contract at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol  2. Observe the assertGovernanceApproved function  ``` function assertGovernanceApproved(     address sender,     address target,     bool emergency   ) public { ... pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp; ... } ```  3. Assume assertGovernanceApproved is called with sender x and target y and pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime is 100 and block.timestamp is 10000 then  ``` pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp; // 10000+100=10100 ```  4. Again assertGovernanceApproved is called with same argument after timestamp 10100. This time unlockTime is set to very high value  (assume block.timestamp is 10500). This is incorrect  ``` pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp; // 10100+10500=20600 ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps unlock time should be calculated like below  ``` constant public CONSTANT_UNLOCK_TIME = 1 days; // example pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime = CONSTANT_UNLOCK_TIME +  block.timestamp; ```
