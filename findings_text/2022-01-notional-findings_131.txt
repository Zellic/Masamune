# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details    ## Impact  No events in TreasuryManager and sNOTE contracts are indexed, so their filtering is disabled, which makes it harder to programmatically use the system  ## Proof of Concept  TreasuryManager events don't have indices:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/TreasuryManager.sol#L38-41  sNOTE events also aren't indexed:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L43-50  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding the indices to the key parameters, first of all owner and account addresses
