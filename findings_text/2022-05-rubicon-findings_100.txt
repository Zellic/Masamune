In Rubicon, when creating a pair, the paired asset's approval is not set to 0 before it is updated.  ## Impact Can't create pairs with USDT, the most popular stablecoin, as as the approval will revert.  ## Proof of Concept [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) reverts on approval if previous allowance is not 0: ``` require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0))); ``` When creating a pair, Rubicon [approves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/rubiconPools/BathHouse.sol#L180) the paired asset without first setting it to 0: ``` desiredPairedAsset.approve(pairedPool, initialLiquidityExistingBathToken); ``` Therefore, if desiredPairedAsset is USDT, the function will revert, and pairs with USDT can not be created.  This problem will also manifest in RubiconMarket's [approval function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconRouter.sol#L157) and BathToken's [approval function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/rubiconPools/BathToken.sol#L256),   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Set the allowance to 0 before setting it to the new value.
