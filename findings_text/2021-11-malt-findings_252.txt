# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `MovingAverage.sol` contract defines several variables that in the end make the `samples` array act as a ring buffer: - `sampleMemory`: The total length (buffer size) of the `samples` array. `samples` is initialized with `sampleMemory` zero observations. - `counter`: The pending sample index (modulo `sampleMemory`)  The `_getFirstSample` function computes the first sample as `(counter + 1) % sampleMemory` which returns the correct index only _if the ring buffer is full_, i.e., it wraps around. (in the `counter + 1 >= sampleMemory`).  If the `samples` array does not wrap around yet, the zero index should be returned instead.  ## Impact Returning `counter + 1` if `counter + 1 < sampleMemory` returns a zero initialized `samples` observation index. This then leads to a wrong computation of the TWAP.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an additional check for `if (counter + 1 < sampleMemory) return 0` in `_getFirstSample`.
