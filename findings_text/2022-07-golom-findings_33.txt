# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/main/contracts/core/GolomTrader.sol#L203-L271   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact - Users can avoid paying fees while trading trustlessly & using golom's network effects ## Description - If a maker makes below mentioned `AvoidsFeesContract` a [reservedAddress](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/main/contracts/core/GolomTrader.sol#L220) and hides the info about how much they want their NFT in [order.root](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/main/contracts/core/GolomTrader.sol#L58), they can avoid paying fees while trading trustlessly and using the nework effects of golom maketplace with 0 [o.totalAmt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/main/contracts/core/GolomTrader.sol#L52). see POC to get a better idea. - Here the maker uses order.root to hide the amount they want to get paid because it is much cleaner for a POC.     - but since golom does not have an API where user can submit a signature without using the frontend, they will use something like deadline to hide the amount they want to get paid.      - Reason they would use deadline is because that is something they can control in the golom NFT frontend      - They can pack the information about deadline and amount they want to get paid, in one uint256 as a deadline and then the check in the contract would look a different ## Proof of Concept - clone the [repo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom) and run `yarn` - create a `AvoidsFeesContract.sol` contract in `contracts/test/` folder with following code ``` //contract that avoids paying fees everytime  pragma solidity 0.8.11;

(hardhat)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - make sure that o.totalAmt is greater than p.paymentAmt in addition to [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/main/contracts/core/GolomTrader.sol#L217) check
