The tokens are thoroughly verified by `burnLPForETH` in `ETHPoolLPFactory`.  However, theres is no checking for the validity of `_stakingFundsVaults`, nor the relationship between `LPTokens` and `_stakingFundsVaults`. Therefore, an attacker can create fake contracts for `_stakingFundsVaults`, with `burnLPTokensForETH`, that takes `LPTokens` as parameters. The `msg.sender` in `burnLPTokensForETH` is `GiantMevAndFeesPool`, thus the attacker can transfer `LPTokens` that belongs to `GiantMevAndFeesPool` to any addresses it controls.  ## Tools Used manual  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Always passing liquid staking manager address, checking its real and then requesting either the savETH vault or staking funds vault is a good idea to prove the validity of vaults.
