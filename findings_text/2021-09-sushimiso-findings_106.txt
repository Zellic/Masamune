# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function createToken emits TokenInitialized event, however, it does it before actually deploying the token so address(token) will always be empty (0x0):    emit TokenInitialized(address(token), _templateId, _data);    token = deployToken(_templateId, _integratorFeeAccount); This may confuse external consumers of this event.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Usually, a good practice is to emit events in the end after all the actions are done.
