This can lead to user's loosing funds or any unexpected behaviour that transaction replay attacks usually lead to.  ## Proof of Concept As specified by the [EIP4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard `to prevent replay attacks ... the signature should depend on chainid`. In [VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#getHash](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L77-L90) the chainId is missing which means that the same UserOperation can be replayed on a different chain for the same smart contract account if the `verifyingSigner` is the same (and most likely this will be the case).  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the chainId in the calculation of the UserOperation hash in [VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#getHash](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L77-L90)  ```     function getHash(UserOperation calldata userOp)     public view returns (bytes32) { // @audit change to view         //can't use userOp.hash(), since it contains also the paymasterAndData itself.         return keccak256(abi.encode(                 userOp.getSender(),                 userOp.nonce,                 keccak256(userOp.initCode),                 keccak256(userOp.callData),                 userOp.callGasLimit,                 userOp.verificationGasLimit,                 userOp.preVerificationGas,                 userOp.maxFeePerGas,                 userOp.maxPriorityFeePerGas   block.chainid // @audit add chain id             ));     } ```
