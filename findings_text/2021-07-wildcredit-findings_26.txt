# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function withdrawBorrowETH of the contract LendingPair calls _wethWithdrawTo and then calls _checkMinReserve. However _wethWithdrawTo also calls _checkMinReserve  (except when _amount but then not much happens anyway.  So the call to _checkMinReserve in withdrawBorrowETH is redundant and uses some extra gas.  ## Proof of Concept //https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/LendingPair.sol#L106  function withdrawBorrowETH(uint _amount) external {    ..     _wethWithdrawTo(msg.sender, _amount);     _checkMinReserve(address(WETH)); // is also called in _wethWithdrawTo   }   function _wethWithdrawTo(address _to, uint _amount) internal override {     if (_amount > 0) {       TransferHelper._wethWithdrawTo(_to, _amount);       _checkMinReserve(address(WETH));     }   }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider removing the _checkMinReserve in withdrawBorrowETH Or consider moving the _checkMinReserve to all functions where _wethWithdrawTo is called
