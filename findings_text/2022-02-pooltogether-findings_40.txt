## Gas Optimizations  ### Unchecked math will save on gas ```   function _computeLockUntil(uint96 _lockDuration) internal view returns (uint96) {     return uint96(block.timestamp) + _lockDuration; //@audit Gas Optimization Unchecked   } ``` The `_computeLockUntil` function in `TWABDelegator.sol` can be optimized by adding the `unchecked` directive as this will never overflow the `uint96` type since it is limited by the `MAX_LOCK` constant (which is currently assigned to 180 days() by the call to `_requireLockDuration(_lockDuration);`. ``` justin@Stealth: 18362 » frf test.sol compiling... Compiling 2 files with 0.8.12 Compilation finished successfully success. Script ran successfully. Gas Used: 5401 == Logs ==  180 days, 15552000 Current timestamp, 1645633955 Current timestamp + 5000 years, 159325633955 Max uint96, 79228162514264337593543950335  ```  ### Unneeded Zero Address Check In the `stake` function of the `TWABDelegator.sol` file, the `_requireRecipientNotZeroAddress` function is called on the `_to` parameter. However, this is unnecessary since the `_mint` function checks for the zero address when called. As such, it would be more gas efficient to not perform this call. ```  function stake(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {     _requireRecipientNotZeroAddress(_to);     //@audit Gas Optimization Above is unneeded since _mint checks whether _to is zero addr or not     _requireAmountGtZero(_amount);      IERC20(ticket).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);     _mint(_to, _amount); ```   ### More efficient order of operations in `updateDelegatee` In the `updateDelegatee` function of the `TWABDelegator.sol` file the `_lockUntil` variable is defined by calling the `_computeLockUntil` function. However, if the `_lockDuration` is 0, then this value is the same as the current `block.timestamp`. As a result, the following code would be an optimization:  Original Code: ``` uint96 _lockUntil = _computeLockUntil(_lockDuration); //@audit Gas Optimization  if (_lockDuration > 0) {     _delegation.setLockUntil(_lockUntil); }  _delegateCall(_delegation, _delegatee);  emit DelegateeUpdated(_delegator, _slot, _delegatee, _lockUntil, msg.sender); ```  Optimized Code: ``` uint96 _lockUntil = block.timestamp; if (_lockDuration > 0) {     _lockUntil = _computeLockUntil(_lockDuration);     _delegation.setLockUntil(_lockUntil); } _delegateCall(_delegation, _delegatee); emit DelegateeUpdated(_delegator, _slot, _delegatee, _lockUntil, msg.sender); ```  Here are the tests with the optimizations (* indicates Optimized case): ``` ·························|·····························|·············|·············|··············|···············|·············· |  Contract              ·  Method                     ·  Min        ·  Max        ·  Avg         ·  # calls      ·  usd (avg)  │ ·························|·····························|·············|·············|··············|···············|·············· |  TWABDelegatorHarness  ·  updateDelegatee            ·     140113  ·     144124  ·      141911  ·            7  ·          -  │ ·························|·····························|·············|·············|··············|···············|·············· |  *TWABDelegatorHarness ·  updateDelegatee            ·     139965  ·     144126  ·      141806  ·            7  ·          -  │ ·························|·····························|·············|·············|··············|···············|·············· ```   ## Non-Critcal   ### Missing comment for the `to` parameter There is no comment on the `to` parameter for the `TransferredDelegation` event in the `TWABDelegator.sol` file. ```   /**    * @notice Emitted when a delegator withdraws an amount of tickets from a delegation to their wallet.    * @param delegator Address of the delegator    * @param slot  Slot of the delegation    * @param amount Amount of tickets withdrawn    */    //@audit Missing comment for the `to` parameter   event TransferredDelegation(     address indexed delegator,     uint256 indexed slot,     uint256 amount,     address indexed to   );   ```     ## Low    ### Incorrect Event Parameters   The `TWABDelegator.sol`'s `TicketsStaked` event's first parameter should be the delegator, as such, it should be `msg.sender` not `_to` as `_to` is the recipient.   ```     /**    * @notice Emitted when tickets have been staked.    * @param delegator Address of the delegator    * @param amount Amount of tickets staked    */   event TicketsStaked(address indexed delegator, uint256 amount);    ...      /**    * @notice Stake `_amount` of tickets in this contract.    * @dev Tickets can be staked on behalf of a `_to` user.    * @param _to Address to which the stake will be attributed    * @param _amount Amount of tickets to stake    */   function stake(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {     _requireRecipientNotZeroAddress(_to); //@audit See here that the _to is the recipient, not the delegator.     _requireAmountGtZero(_amount);      IERC20(ticket).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);     _mint(_to, _amount);      emit TicketsStaked(_to, _amount);//@audit the first parameter of TicketsStacked should be delegator, not recipient. Should be msg.sender.   }   ```  ### Incorrect Comment Associated with `transferDelegationTo` The comments above the `transferDelegationTo` function are incorrect. The first line, which begins with `@notice`, says `The tickets are transferred to the caller`. However, the tickets are transfered to the `_to` parameter as can be seen by the line `_transfer(_delegation, _to, _amount);` In addition, the comment directly below that states `Will directly send the tickets to the delegator wallet.` This is also incorrect per the above reason. ```   /**    * @notice Withdraw an `_amount` of tickets from a delegation. The delegator is assumed to be the caller. The tickets are transferred to the caller.    * @dev Will directly send the tickets to the delegator wallet.    * @dev Will revert if delegation is still locked.    * @param _slot Slot of the delegation    * @param _amount Amount to withdraw    * @param _to Account to transfer the withdrawn tickets to    * @return The address of the Delegation    */   function transferDelegationTo(     uint256 _slot,     uint256 _amount,     address _to   ) external returns (Delegation) {     _requireRecipientNotZeroAddress(_to);      Delegation _delegation = Delegation(_computeAddress(msg.sender, _slot));     _transfer(_delegation, _to, _amount);      emit TransferredDelegation(msg.sender, _slot, _amount, _to);      return _delegation;   }   ```
