# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The line `return (rate < MIN_RATE) ? MIN_RATE : rate;` can be written as `return Math.max(rate, MIN_RATE);` for an easier reading, since the Math library is already imported.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/main/contracts/InterestRateModel.sol#L37  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Rewrite using the Math.max function
