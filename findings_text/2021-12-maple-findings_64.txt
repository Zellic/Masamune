# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/maple-labs/liquidations/blob/bb09e17b1fac1126ce7734e58c3133be06162590/contracts/Liquidator.sol#L45-L62  ```solidity function liquidatePortion(uint256 swapAmount_, uint256 maxReturnAmount_, bytes calldata data_) external override {     require(!_locked, "LIQ:LP:LOCKED");      _locked = true;     ...     _locked = false; } ```  `SSTORE` from false (0) to true (1) (or any non-zero value), the cost is 20000; `SSTORE` from 1 to 2 (or any other non-zero value), the cost is 5000.  By storing the original value once again, a refund is triggered (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200).  Since refunds are capped to a percentage of the total transaction's gas, it is best to keep them low, to increase the likelihood of the full refund coming into effect.  Therefore, switching between 1, 2 instead of 0, 1 will be more gas efficient.
