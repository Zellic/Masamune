# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  OpenZeppelin’s safeApprove reverts for non-0 to non-0 approvals. This is considered in a few places where safeApprove is performed twice with the first one for 0 and then for the desired allowance. However, there are uses of safeApprove where it is called only once for the desired allowance but it is not clear that the current allowance is guaranteed to be zero. In such cases, safeApprove may revert.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6241995ad323952e38f8d405103ed994a2dcde8e/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L49-L55  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/converters/StablesConverter.sol#L78  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L88  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Approve to 0 first while using safeApprove or use increaseAllowance instead.
