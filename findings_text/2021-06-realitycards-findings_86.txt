# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Missing _checkState(States.OPEN) on first line of rentAllCards() as specified on L617. These core market functions are supposed to operate only when market is open but the missing check allows control to proceed further in the control flow. In this case, the function proceeds to call newRental() which has a conditional check state == States.OPEN and silently returns success otherwise, without reverting.  Impact: rentAllCards does not fail if executed when market is closed or locked. newRental returns silently without failure when market is closed or locked.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L617  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L637-L658  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L672   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a require() to check market open state in the beginning of all core market functions and revert with an informative error string otherwise.
