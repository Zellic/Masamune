# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `DutchAuction._currentPrice()` is computed by multiplying with `priceDrop()`. However, `priceDrop()` already performs a division and the final current price, therefore, loses precision.  Note that `priceDrop()` could even return `0` for ultra-low prices or very long auctions.  Imagine the actual payment per auction token price is `10^-12` => `startPrice` and `endPrice` are set with 18 decimals as ~`10^6`, but for auctions over a year (31,536,000 seconds > `10^6`) it'll then return 0.  ## Impact Precision can be lost leading to less accurate token auction results or even completely breaking the auction if the price is very low and the auctions are very long.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Perform all multiplications before divisions:  ```solidity uint256 priceDiff = block.timestamp.sub(uint256(marketInfo.startTime)).mul(     uint256(_marketPrice.startPrice.sub(_marketPrice.minimumPrice))   ) / uint256(_marketInfo.endTime.sub(_marketInfo.startTime)); ```
