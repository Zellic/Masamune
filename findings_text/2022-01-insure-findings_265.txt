# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Ownership.sol#L17-L20  ```solidity constructor() {     _owner = msg.sender;     emit AcceptNewOwnership(_owner); } ```  At L19, the parameter of `AcceptNewOwnership` can use `msg.sender` directly to avoid unnecessary storage read of `_owner` to save some gas.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Ownership.sol#L65-L71  ```solidity function acceptTransferOwnership() external override onlyFutureOwner {     /***         *@notice Accept a transfer of ownership         */     _owner = _futureOwner;     emit AcceptNewOwnership(_owner); } ```  At L69, `_futureOwner` can use `msg.sender` directly to avoid unnecessary storage read of `_futureOwner` to save some gas.  As `onlyFutureOwner()` ensures that `require(_futureOwner == msg.sender, "...");`.
