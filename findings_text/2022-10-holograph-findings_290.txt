A source contract, however, has excessive privileges in the Holographed ERC721. Specifically, it can burn and transfer users' NFTs without their approval ([HolographERC721.sol#L500](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L500), [HolographERC721.sol#L577](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/enforcer/HolographERC721.sol#L577)): ```solidity function sourceBurn(uint256 tokenId) external onlySource {   address wallet = _tokenOwner[tokenId];   _burn(wallet, tokenId); }  function sourceTransfer(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlySource {   address wallet = _tokenOwner[tokenId];   _transferFrom(wallet, to, tokenId); } ```  While this might be desirable for extensibility and flexibility, this puts users at the risk of being robbed by the source contract owner or a hacker who hacked the source contract owner's key. ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider removing the `sourceBurn` and `sourceTransfer` functions of `HolographERC721` and requiring user approval to transfer or burn their tokens (`burn` and `safeTransferFrom` can be called by a source contract instead of `sourceBurn` and `sourceTransfer`).
