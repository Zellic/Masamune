It is required to find out contract balance increase/decrease after the transfer. This pattern also prevents from re-entrancy attack vector.  ## Proof of Concept  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommended code: ```solidity function fundPool(uint poolId) internal {     Pool storage pool = pools[poolId];     bool success = true;     uint amount;     for (uint i = 0; i < pool.rewardFunding.length; i++) {         amount = getMaximumRewards(poolId, i);         // transfer the tokens from pool-creator to this contract           uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)); // remembering asset balance before the transfer         IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);         uint256 newAmount = IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore; // updating actual amount to the contract balance increase         success = success && newAmount == amount; // making sure amounts match          // bookkeeping to make sure pools don't share tokens         pool.rewardFunding[i] += amount;     }     require(success, 'Token deposits failed'); } ```
