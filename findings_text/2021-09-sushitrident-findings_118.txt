# Handle  hrkrshnn   # Vulnerability details  ## Consider putting some parts of `_div` in unchecked  [Context](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/IndexPool.sol#L335)  ``` diff modified   contracts/pool/IndexPool.sol @@ -332,7 +332,8 @@ contract IndexPool is IPool, TridentERC20 {       function _div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c2) {          uint256 c0 = a * BASE; -        uint256 c1 = c0 + (b / 2); +        unchecked { uint256 tmp =  b / 2; } +        uint256 c1 = c0 + tmp;          c2 = c1 / b;      } ```  Looking at the optimized assembly generated, the unchecked version doesn't seem to have the additional check for division by zero. I'm not entirely sure why, but my guess is because of inlining. Also consider replacing the division by inline assembly.  ``` solidity uint tmp; assembly {     tmp := div(b, 2) } uint256 c1 = c0 + tmp; ```  The change avoids an `if` condition which checks if the divisor is zero, which the optimizer is currently unable to optimize out. The gas savings would be around 16 (reduces a `jumpi`, `push 0` and `dupN`). Since the `_div` function is called from throughout the code (also present in other contracts), this may be worth considering, although I admit this might be too much of a micro-optimization.
