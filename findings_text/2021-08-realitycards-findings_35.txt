# Handle  0xImpostor   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  When the current owner of the card is still the new owner of the card, `transferCard` is called before the treasury is updated. While this does not currently pose a risk, it is not aligned with best practices of [check-effect-interations](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html) and opens your code to a potential re-entrancy attack in the future.  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx // line 381 treasury.updateRentalRate(     _oldOwner,     _user,     user[_oldOwner][index[_oldOwner][_market][_card]].price,     _price,     block.timestamp ); transferCard(_market, _card, _oldOwner, _user, _price); ... // line 449 treasury.updateRentalRate(     _user,     _user,     _price,     _currUser.price,     block.timestamp ); transferCard(_market, _card, _user, _user, _currUser.price); ```
