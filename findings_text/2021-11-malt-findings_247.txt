# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ERC20.approve()` function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do **not** revert if the transfer failed but return `false` instead.  In addition, some tokens (like [USDT L199](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.  ```solidity IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(operator), 0); IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(operator), amount); ```  This issue exists for example in `AuctionParticipant.purchaseArbitrageTokens`:  ```solidity auctionRewardToken.approve(address(auction), balance); ```  As well as in `UniswapHandler.buyMalt`:  ```solidity rewardToken.approve(address(router), rewardBalance); ```  ## Impact Tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, by either returning `false` on failure or reverting if approved from a non-zero value, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We recommend using OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` versions with the `safeApprove(0)` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
