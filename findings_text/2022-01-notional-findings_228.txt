# Handle  IllIllI   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When the value of the post-loop increment/decrement is not stored or used in any calculations, the prefix increment/decrement operators (`++i`/`--i`) cost less gas PER LOOP than the postfix increment/decrement operators (`i++`/`i--`)  ## Proof of Concept There is one example of this issue in the codebase:  ```Solidity for (uint256 i; i < currencies.length; i++) {         ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/TreasuryAction.sol#L157   ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use `++i` rather than `i++` in all places
