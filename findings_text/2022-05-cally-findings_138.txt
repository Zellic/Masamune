# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L406-L423   # Vulnerability details   The vulnerability or bug is in the implementation of the function getDutchAuctionStrike() The AUCTION_DURATION is defined as 24 hours, and consider that the dutchAuctionReserveStrike (or reserveStrike) will never be set to 0 by user.  Now if a vault is created with startingStrike value of 55 and reserveStrike of 13.5 , the auction price will drop from 55 to 13.5 midway at ~12 hours. So, after 12 hours from start of auction, the rate will be constant at reserveStrike of 13.5, and remaining time of 12 hours of auction is a waste.   Some other examples : ``` startStrike, reserveStrike, time-to-reach-reserveStrike 55 , 13.5  , ~12 hours 55 , 5     , ~16.7 hours 55 , 1.5   , ~20 hours 5  , 1.5   , ~11 hours ``` ## Impact The impact is high wrt Usability, where users have reduced available time to participate in the auction (when price is expected to change). The vault-Creators or the option-Buyers may or may not be aware of this inefficiency, i.e., how much effective time is available for auction.  ## Proof of Concept Contract : Cally.sol Function : getDutchAuctionStrike ()  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The function getDutchAuctionStrike() can be modified such that price drops to the reserveStrike exactly at 24 hours from start of auction. ```         /*             delta = max(auctionEnd - currentTimestamp, 0)             progress = delta / auctionDuration             auctionStrike = progress^2 * (startingStrike - reserveStrike)             << Changes here             strike = auctionStrike + reserveStrike                                    << Changes here         */         uint256 delta = auctionEndTimestamp > block.timestamp ? auctionEndTimestamp - block.timestamp : 0;         uint256 progress = (1e18 * delta) / AUCTION_DURATION;         uint256 auctionStrike = (progress * progress * (startingStrike-reserveStrike)) / (1e18 * 1e18);          strike = auctionStrike + reserveStrike; ```
