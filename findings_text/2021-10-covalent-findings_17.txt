# Handle  xYrYuYx   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact UpdateGlobalExchangeRate has incorrect implementation when `totalGlobalShares` is zero.  If any user didn't start stake, `totalGlobalShares` is 0, and every stake it will increase. but there is possibility that `totalGlobalShares` can be 0 amount later by unstake or disable validator.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/xYrYuYx/C4-2021-10-covalent/blob/main/test/c4-tests/C4_issues.js#L76 This is my test case to proof this issue.  In my test case, I disabled validator to make `totalGlobalShares` to zero. And in this case, some reward amount will be forever locked in the contract. After disable validator, I mined 10 blocks, and 4 more blocks mined due to other function calls, So total 14 CQT is forever locked in the contract.   ## Tools Used Hardhat test  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Please think again when `totalGlobalShares` is zero.
