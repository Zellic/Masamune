If an existing proxy is found, the deployment reverts:  [`MIMOProxyRegistry#deployFor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-mimo/blob/eb1a5016b69f72bc1e4fd3600a65e908bd228f13/contracts/proxy/MIMOProxyRegistry.sol#L45-L59)  ```solidity   function deployFor(address owner) public override returns (IMIMOProxy proxy) {     IMIMOProxy currentProxy = _currentProxies[owner];      // Do not deploy if the proxy already exists and the owner is the same.     if (address(currentProxy) != address(0) && currentProxy.owner() == owner) {       revert CustomErrors.PROXY_ALREADY_EXISTS(owner);     }      // Deploy the proxy via the factory.     proxy = factory.deployFor(owner);      // Set or override the current proxy for the owner.     _currentProxies[owner] = IMIMOProxy(proxy);   } } ```  However, if a `MIMOProxy` owner intentionally or accidentally destroys their proxy by `delegatecall`ing a target that calls `selfdestruct`, the address of their destroyed proxy will remain in the `_currentProxies` mapping, but the static call to `currentProxy.owner()` on L49 will revert. The caller will be blocked from deploying a new proxy from the same address that created their original `MIMOProxy.  **Impact:** If a user accidentally destroys their MIMOProxy, they must use a new EOA address to deploy another.  ### Recommendation  Check whether the proxy has been destroyed as part of the "proxy already exists" conditions. If the proxy address has a codesize of zero, it has been destroyed:  ```solidity     // Do not deploy if the proxy already exists and the owner is the same.     if (address(currentProxy) != address(0) && currentProxy.code.length > 0 && currentProxy.owner() == owner) {       revert CustomErrors.PROXY_ALREADY_EXISTS(owner);     }  ```  ### Test cases  We'll use this `ProxyAttacks` helper contract to manipulate proxy storage. Note that it has the same storage layout as `MIMOProxy`.  ```solidity contract ProxyAttacks {     address public owner;    uint256 public minGasReserve;    mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes4 => bool))) internal _permissions;     // Selector 0x9cb8a26a    function selfDestruct() external {      selfdestruct(payable(address(0)));    } } ```  Then deploy the `ProxyAttacks` helper in a test environment and use `MIMOProxy` to `delegatecall` into it:  ```typescript import chai, { expect } from 'chai'; import { solidity } from 'ethereum-waffle'; import { deployments, ethers } from 'hardhat';  import { MIMOProxy, MIMOProxyFactory, MIMOProxyRegistry, ProxyAttacks } from '../../typechain';  chai.use(solidity);  const setup = deployments.createFixture(async () => {   const { deploy } = deployments;   const [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();    await deploy("MIMOProxy", {     from: owner.address,     args: [],   });   const mimoProxyBase: MIMOProxy = await ethers.getContract("MIMOProxy");    await deploy("MIMOProxyFactory", {     from: owner.address,     args: [mimoProxyBase.address],   });   const mimoProxyFactory: MIMOProxyFactory = await ethers.getContract("MIMOProxyFactory");    await deploy("MIMOProxyRegistry", {     from: owner.address,     args: [mimoProxyFactory.address],   });   const mimoProxyRegistry: MIMOProxyRegistry = await ethers.getContract("MIMOProxyRegistry");    await deploy("ProxyAttacks", {     from: owner.address,     args: [],   });   const proxyAttacks: ProxyAttacks = await ethers.getContract("ProxyAttacks");    return {     owner,     attacker,     mimoProxyBase,     mimoProxyFactory,     mimoProxyRegistry,     proxyAttacks,   }; });  describe("Proxy attack tests", () => {   it("Proxy instance self destruct + recreation", async () => {     const { owner, mimoProxyRegistry, proxyAttacks } = await setup();     await mimoProxyRegistry.deploy();     const currentProxy = await mimoProxyRegistry.getCurrentProxy(owner.address);     const proxy = await ethers.getContractAt("MIMOProxy", currentProxy);      // Delegatecall to selfDestruct on ProxyAttacks contract     await proxy.execute(proxyAttacks.address, "0x9cb8a26a");      // Owner's existing proxy is destroyed     expect(proxy.owner()).to.be.revertedWith("call revert exception");      // Cannot deploy another proxy for this address through the registry     await expect(mimoProxyRegistry.deploy()).to.be.revertedWith("function returned an unexpected amount of data");   }); }); ```
