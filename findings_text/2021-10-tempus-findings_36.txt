# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The loop here is not really necessary as _TOTAL_TOKENS is a constant of 2 so there is always just 1 iteration:         for (uint256 i = 1; i < _TOTAL_TOKENS; ++i) {             uint256 currentBalance = balances[i];             if (currentBalance > maxBalance) {                 chosenTokenIndex = i;                 maxBalance = currentBalance;             }         }  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider if you want to reduce gas usage by eliminating this loop here but taking the risk that _TOTAL_TOKENS will not be updated to a different value.
