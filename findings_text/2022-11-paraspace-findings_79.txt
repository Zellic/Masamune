# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace/blob/main/paraspace-core/contracts/misc/NFTFloorOracle.sol#L335   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact During `_removeFeeder` operation in `NFTFloorOracle` contract, the feeder is removed from `feeders` array, and linking in `feederPositionMap` for the specific feeder is removed. Deletion logic is implemented in "Swap + Pop" way, so indexes changes, but existing **code doesn't update indexes in** `feederPositionMap` **after feeder removal**, which causes the issue of Denial of Service for further removals. As a result: - Impossible to remove some `feeders` from the contract due to Out of Bounds array access. Removal fails because of transaction revert. - Data in `feederPositionMap` is corrupted after some `feeders` removal. Data linking from `feederPositionMap.index` to `feeders` array is broken.   ## Proof of Concept ```     address internal feederA = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4;     address internal feederB = 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2;     address internal feederC = 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db;      function corruptFeedersMapping() external {         console.log("Starting from empty feeders array. Array size: %s", feeders.length);         address[] memory initialFeeders = new address[](3);         initialFeeders[0] = feederA;         initialFeeders[1] = feederB;         initialFeeders[2] = feederC;         this.addFeeders(initialFeeders);         console.log("Feeders array: [%s, %s, %s]", initialFeeders[0], initialFeeders[1], initialFeeders[2]);         console.log("Remove feeder B");         this.removeFeeder(feederB);         console.log("feederPositionMap[A] = %s, feederPositionMap[C] = %s", feederPositionMap[feederA].index, feederPositionMap[feederC].index);         console.log("Mapping for Feeder C store index 2, which was not updated after removal of B. Feeders array length is : %s", feeders.length);         console.log("Try remove Feeder C. Transaction will be reverted because of access out of bounds of array. Data is corrupted");         this.removeFeeder(feederC);     } ``` Snippet execution result: ![Alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/90ac873cd71194527d4d3b9bfe6e317e.png "Optional title")  ## Tools Used Visual inspection; Solidity snippet for PoC  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Update index in `feederPositionMap` after feeders swap and pop. ``` feeders[feederIndex] = feeders[feeders.length - 1]; feederPositionMap[feeders[feederIndex]].index = feederIndex; //Index update added as a recommendation feeders.pop(); ```
