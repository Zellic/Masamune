# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Assuming the initialize() function is going to be called from a deployment script, its visibility can be made external.   For public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically which costs gas. If a function is only called externally, making its visibility as external will save gas because external function’s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L98-L104   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change visibility to external.
