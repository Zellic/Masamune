# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function setSampleMemory of MovingAverage.sol takes the modulo of counter with the new value of _sampleMemory: "counter = counter % _sampleMemory;"  Suppose: counter =15 ; sampleMemory=10 and  _sampleMemory=12 Then:   counter = counter % _sampleMemory ==> 3,  which means processing will continue at position 3.  However I think it should use: counter = counter % sampleMemory,  so it will continue at position 5  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/MovingAverage.sol#L424-L442  ```JS function setSampleMemory(uint256 _sampleMemory) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin privs")  {   ...     if (_sampleMemory > sampleMemory) {       ...       counter = counter % _sampleMemory;     } else {    }     sampleMemory = _sampleMemory; } ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Doublecheck the theory above and if you agree: change ```JS  counter = counter % _sampleMemory; ``` to ```JS  counter = counter %  sampleMemory; ```
