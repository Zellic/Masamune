If the receiver is a contract this may be insufficient to process the `receive()` function. As a result the user would be unable to receive funds from this function.  ## Proof of Concept  ```     function attemptETHTransfer(address to, uint256 value)         private         returns (bool)     {         // Here increase the gas limit a reasonable amount above the default, and try         // to send ETH to the recipient.         // NOTE: This might allow the recipient to attempt a limited reentrancy attack.         (bool success, ) = to.call{value: value, gas: 30000}("");         return success;     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider removing the `gas` field to use the default amount and protect from reentrancy by using reentrancy guards and the [check-effects-interaction pattern](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html). Note this pattern is already applied correctly.
