# Lines of code   https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/StakingFundsVault.sol#L218   # Vulnerability details  ## Description  claimRewards in StakingFundsVault.sol has this code: ``` if (i == 0 && !Syndicate(payable(liquidStakingNetworkManager.syndicate())).isNoLongerPartOfSyndicate(_blsPubKeys[i])) {     // Withdraw any ETH accrued on free floating SLOT from syndicate to this contract     // If a partial list of BLS keys that have free floating staked are supplied, then partial funds accrued will be fetched     _claimFundsFromSyndicateForDistribution(         liquidStakingNetworkManager.syndicate(),         _blsPubKeys     );     // Distribute ETH per LP     updateAccumulatedETHPerLP(); } ```  The issue is that if the first BLS public key is not part of the syndicate, then \_claimFundsFromSyndicateForDistribution will not be called, even on BLS keys that are eligible for syndicate rewards. This leads to reduced rewards for user.  This is different from a second bug which discusses the possibility of using a stale acculmulatedETHPerLP.  ## Impact  Users will not receive rewards for claims of valid public keys if first passed key is not part of syndicate.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Drop the i==0 requirement, which was intended to make sure the claim isn't called multiple times. Use a hasClaimed boolean instead.
