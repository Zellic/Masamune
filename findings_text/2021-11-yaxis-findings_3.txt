# Handle  tqts   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Double calculation of the same value in mint()  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/AlToken.sol#L69  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The _total variable in line 66 is defined as _amount + hasMinted(msg.sender). Line 69 needs that value again but recalculates it again instead of using the stored one. Replace line 69 with hasMinted(msg.sender) = _total
