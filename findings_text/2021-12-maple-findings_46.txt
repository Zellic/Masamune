# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/9684bcef06481e493d060974b1777a4517c4e792/contracts/MapleLoan.sol#L56-L63  ```solidity=56 function closeLoan(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {         // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.         require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:CL:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");          ( principal_, interest_ ) = _closeLoan();          emit LoanClosed(principal_, interest_);     } ```  Based on the context, we believe that the `closeLoan()` should only be called by the `borrower`. However, the current implementation allows anyone to call `closeLoan()` anytime after `fundLoan()`.  If there is no `earlyFee`, this enables a griefing attack, causing the `borrower` and `lender` to abandon this contract and redo everything which costs more gas.  If a platform fee exits, the lender will also suffer fund loss from the platform fee charged in `fundLoan()`.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity=56 function closeLoan(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {         // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.         require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:CL:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");          require(msg.sender == _borrower, "ML:DF:NOT_BORROWER");          ( principal_, interest_ ) = _closeLoan();          emit LoanClosed(principal_, interest_);     } ```
