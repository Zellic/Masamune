# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increase gas costs on all `onlyAdmin` operations  ## Proof of Concept  The `SLINGSHOT_ADMIN_ROLE` variable is marked as `constant`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-slingshot/blob/f6e7a0a39e3267bbe3c7fe60d6074cbf54f5750f/contracts/Adminable.sol#L11  This results in the `keccak` operation being performed whenever the variable is used, increasing gas costs relative to just storing the output hash. Changing to `immutable` will only perform hashing on contract deployment which will save gas.  See: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232#issuecomment-646131646  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change the variable to be `immutable` rather than `constant`
