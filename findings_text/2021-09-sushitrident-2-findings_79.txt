# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When an user subscribes to an incentive using ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's `subscribe`, the function checks that `incentiveId` is appropriate: ```js require(incentiveId <= incentiveCount[pool], "NOT_INCENTIVE"); ``` This check is actually incorrect, and it should use a `<` instead of `<=`.  If this was the only requirement, it would be possible to subscribe to the next incentive, causing some problems. Fortunately the next line saves the day: `require(block.timestamp > incentive.startTime && block.timestamp < incentive.endTime, "TIMED_OUT");` this fails for uninitiated incentives.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L72  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider removing this requirement to save gas. The check for existing pool is already considered when looking at `block.timestamp < incentive.endTime`.
