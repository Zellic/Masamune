# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L319-L322   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `getAmountToTransfer` function of `LiquidityPool` updates `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` by adding some fee to it but the formula is wrong and the value of `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` will be divided by `BASE_DIVISOR` (10000000000) each time. After just a few time, the value of `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` will become zero and that amount of `tokenAddress` token will be locked in contract. ## Proof of concept Line 319-322 ``` incentivePool[tokenAddress] = (incentivePool[tokenAddress] + (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee))) / BASE_DIVISOR; ``` Let `x = incentivePool[tokenAddress]`, `y = amount`, `z = transferFeePerc` and `t = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee`. Then that be written as ``` x = (x + (y * (z - t))) / BASE_DIVISOR; x = x / BASE_DIVISOR + (y * (z - t)) / BASE_DIVISOR; ``` ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Fix the bug by change line 319-322 to: ``` incentivePool[tokenAddress] += (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee)) / BASE_DIVISOR; ```
