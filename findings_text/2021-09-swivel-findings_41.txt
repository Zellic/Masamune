# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Operating on a copy of a state variable seems inefficient and confusing in this case.   From a "gas" standpoint it's less efficient.  And future changes could render the addresses in the copied struct invalid if functions being called in redeemZcToken operate on the original state variable.  ## Proof of Concept The copy occurs here: https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L123  The "mkt" variable is referenced here: https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L131  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove line #123: https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L123  Replace "mkt" with "markets[u][m]" in line #131 https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L131
