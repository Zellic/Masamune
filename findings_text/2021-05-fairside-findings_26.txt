# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Conviction scores for new addresses/users fail to initialize+bootstrap in ERC20ConvictionScore’s _updateConvictionScore() because a new user’s numCheckpoints will be zero and never gets initialized.   This effectively means that FairSide conviction scoring fails to bootstrap at all, leading to failure of the protocol’s pivotal feature.  ## Proof of Concept  When Alice transfers FSD tokens to Bob for the first time, _beforeTokenTransfer(Alice, Bob, 100) is triggered which calls _updateConvictionScore(Bob, 100) on Line55 of ERC20ConvictionScore.sol.   In function _updateConvictionScore(), given that this is the first time Bob is receiving FSD tokens, numCheckpoints[Bob] will be 0 (Line116) which will make ts = 0 (Line120), and Bob’s FSD balance will also be zero (Bob never has got FSD tokens prior to this) which makes convictionDelta = 0 (Line122) and not let control go past Line129.   This means that a new checkpoint never gets written, i.e. conviction score never gets initialized, for Bob or for any user for that matter.  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  FairSide’s adjustment of Compound’s conviction scoring is based on time and so needs an initialization to take place vs. Compound’s implementation. A new checkpoint therefore needs to be created+initialized for a new user during token transfer.
