However, as the `mintedSharesAmount` can easily become very large on `LiquidityProviders.sol`, all the users can lose their rewards due to precision loss.  ### PoC  Given:  - rewardsPerSecond is `10e18`; - lastRewardTime is 24 hrs ago;  Then:  1. Alice `addTokenLiquidity()` with `1e8 * 1e18` XYZ on B-Chain, totalSharesMinted == `1e44`; 2. Alice `deposit()` to HyphenLiquidityFarming, totalSharesStaked == `1e44`; 3. 24 hrs later, Alice tries to claim the rewards.   `accumulator = rewardsPerSecond * 24 hours` == 864000e18 == 8.64e23  Expected Results: As the sole staker, Alice should get all the `864000e18` rewards.  Actual Results: Alice received 0 rewards.  That's becasue when `totalSharesStaked > 1e36`, `accumulator = (accumulator * ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION) / totalSharesStaked[_baseToken];` will be round down to `0`.  When the `totalSharesStaked` is large enough, all users will lose their rewards due to precision loss.  ### Recommendation  1. Consider lowering the `BASE_DIVISOR` so that the initial share price can be higher; 2. Consider making `ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION` larger to prevent precision loss;  See also the Recommendation on [WP-H14].
