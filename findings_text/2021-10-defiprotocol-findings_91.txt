# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function handleFees can become cheaper by eliminating this surrounding if/else statement if you initially assign the value to the lastFee upon creation or initialization.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   uint256 public override lastFee = block.timestamp; or in function initialize as it will get this value anyway when doing the initial mintTo. But then you would probably need to skip handleFees if the timeDiff is 0.
