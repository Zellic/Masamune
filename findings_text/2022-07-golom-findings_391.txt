This is because the chainId parameter is computed in constructor. This means even after hard fork chainId would remain same which is incorrect and could cause possible replay attacks  ## Proof of Concept 1. Observe the constructor  ``` constructor(address _governance) {         // sets governance as owner         _transferOwnership(_governance);          uint256 chainId;         assembly {             chainId := chainid()         }          EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256(             abi.encode(                 keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),                 keccak256(bytes('GOLOM.IO')),                 keccak256(bytes('1')),                 chainId,                 address(this)             )         );     } ```  2. As we can see the chainId is derived and then hardcoded in EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH   3. This means even after hard fork, EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH value will remain same and point to incorrect chainId  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH variable should be recomputed everytime by placing current value of chainId
