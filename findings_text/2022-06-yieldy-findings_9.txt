This attack only allows for a relatively small amount of tokens to be unstaked in each call, so is likely not feasible on mainnet. However, on low-cost L2s and for tokens with a small decimal precision it is likely a feasible workaround.  ## Proof of Concept The `instantUnstake` fee is handled by sending the user back `amount - fee`. We can work around the fee by unstaking small amounts (`amount < BASIS_POINTS / fee`) in a loop until reaching the desired amount.  ## Tools Used N/A  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Avoid using subtraction to calculate the fee as this causes the fee to be rounded down rather than the amount. I'd propose calculating amount less fee using a muldiv operation over (1 - fee). In this case, the fee is effectively rounded up instead of down, so it can never be 0 unless fee is 0. Uniswapv2 uses a similar solution for their LP fee: https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/8b82b04a0b9e696c0e83f8b2f00e5d7be6888c79/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L180-L182  It might look like the following: ``` uint256 amountMinusFee = amount * (BASIS_POINTS - fee) / BASIS_POINTS ```
