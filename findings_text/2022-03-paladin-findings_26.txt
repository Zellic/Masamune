So it is possible that following corner cases happen:   - ``setNewSpender`` function cannot set new token   - If userA is already added in ``approvedSpenders`` for TokenA, it can call ``updateSpenderAllowance``.   ## Tools Used Statis code analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Do either of followings depending on the product specification:  (1) If PAL token is only used and other token will never be used at ``PaladinRewardReserve.sol``, stop having ``address token`` argument at ``setNewSpender``, ``updateSpenderAllowance``, ``removeSpender`` and ``transferToken`` functions. Instead, set ``token`` at the constructor or other ways, and limit the ability to flexibly set ``token`` from functions.  (2) If other tokens potentially will be used at ``PaladinRewardReserve.sol``, update data structure of ``approvedSpenders`` mapping and change the logic.  Firstly, it should also contain the info which ``token`` it targets such as ``mapping(address => address => bool)``.  Secondly, it should rewrite the ``require`` logic at each function as follows.  ``` require(!approvedSpenders[spender][token], "Already Spender on the specified Token"); ```  ``` require(approvedSpenders[spender][token], "Not approved Spender on the specified Token"); ```
