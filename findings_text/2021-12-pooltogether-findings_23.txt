# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When you cancel a promotion with cancelPromotion() then the promotion is complete deleted. This means no-one can claim any rewards anymore, because  _promotions[_promotionId] no longer exists.  It also means all the unclaimed tokens (of the previous epochs) will stay locked in the contract.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L119-L138 ```JS function cancelPromotion(uint256 _promotionId, address _to) ... {        ...         uint256 _remainingRewards = _getRemainingRewards(_promotion);         delete _promotions[_promotionId];         ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In the function cancelPromotion() lower the numberOfEpochs or set a state variable, to allow user to claim their rewards.
