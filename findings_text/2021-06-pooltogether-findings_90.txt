# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  `YearnV2YieldSource._withdrawFromVault` uses a wrong subtraction. When withdrawing from the `vault` one redeems `yTokens` for `token`s, thus the `token` balance of the contract should increase after withdrawal. But the contract subtracts the `currentBalance` from the `previousBalance`:  ```solidity uint256 yShares = _tokenToYShares(amount); uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // we accept losses to avoid being locked in the Vault (if losses happened for some reason) if(maxLosses != 0) {     vault.withdraw(yShares, address(this), maxLosses); } else {     vault.withdraw(yShares); } uint256 currentBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // @audit-issue this seems wrong return previousBalance.sub(currentBalance); ```  ## Impact  All vault withdrawals fail due to the integer underflow as the `previousBalance` is less than `currentBalance`. Users won't be able to get back their investment.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It should return `currentBalance > previousBalance ? currentBalance - previousBalance : 0`
