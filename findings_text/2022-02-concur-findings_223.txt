# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L178-185   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  notifyRewardAmount will be inoperable if rewardsDuration bet set to zero. If will cease to produce meaningful results if rewardsDuration be too small or too big  ## Proof of Concept  The setter do not control the value, allowing zero/near zero/enormous duration:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L178-185  Division by the duration is used in notifyRewardAmount:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L143-156  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check for min and max range in the rewardsDuration setter, as too small or too big rewardsDuration breaks the logic
