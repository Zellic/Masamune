Before mitigation, there was an edge case where this function will revert due to division by zero. Edge case: there is no multisigs enabled. (possible when `Ocyticus.disableAllMultisigs(), Ocyticus.pauseEverything()` is called)  # Mitigation [PR #37](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/pull/37) If no multisig is enabled, the mitigation sends the rewards to the `MultisigManager` and it makes sense. But this created another issue. There is no way to retrieve the rewards back from the `MultisigManager`.  # New issue There is no way to retrieve the rewards from the `MultisigManager` and rewards are locked in the vault.  # Code snippet https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/4bcef8b1d4e595c9ba41a091b2ebf1b45858f022/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L229  # Impact There is no way to retrieve the rewards from the `MultisigManager` and rewards are locked in the vault.  # Proof of Concept The rewards that were accrued in this specific edge case are locked in the `MultisigManager`. It is understood that the funds are not lost and the protocol can be upgraded with a new `MultisigManager` contract with a proper function. I evaluate the severity of the new issue as Medium because funds are locked in some specific edge cases and only withdrawable after contract upgrades.  # Tools used Manual Review  # Recommended additional mitigation Add a new external function in the `MultisigManager` with `guardianOrSpecificRegisteredContract("Ocyticus", msg.sender)` modifier and distribute the pending rewards to the active multisigs.  # Conclusion Mitigation error - created another issue for the same edge case.
