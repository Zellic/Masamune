# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `sYETIToken.lastBuyBackPrice` is set in `buyBack` and hardcoded as:  ```solidity function buyBack(address routerAddress, uint256 YUSDToSell, uint256 YETIOutMin, address[] memory path) external onlyOwner {     require(YUSDToSell > 0, "Zero amount");     require(lastBuybackTime + 69 hours < block.timestamp, "Must have 69 hours pass before another buyBack");     yusdToken.approve(routerAddress, YUSDToSell);     uint256[] memory amounts = IRouter(routerAddress).swapExactTokensForTokens(YUSDToSell, YETIOutMin, path, address(this), block.timestamp + 5 minutes);     lastBuybackTime = block.timestamp;     // amounts[0] is the amount of YUSD that was sold, and amounts[1] is the amount of YETI that was gained in return. So the price is amounts[0] / amounts[1]     // @audit this hardcoded lastBuybackPrice is wrong when using a different path (think path length 3)     lastBuybackPrice = div(amounts[0].mul(1e18), amounts[1]);     emit BuyBackExecuted(YUSDToSell, amounts[0], amounts[1]); } ```  It divides the first and second return `amounts` of the swap, however, these amounts depend on the swap `path` parameter that is used by the caller. If a swap path of length 3 is used, then this is obviously wrong. It also assumes that each router sorts the pairs the same way (which is true for Uniswap/Sushiswap).  ## Impact The `lastBuyBackPrice` will be wrong when using a different path. This will lead `rebase`s using a different yeti amount and the `effectiveYetiTokenBalance` being updated wrong.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Verify the first and last element of the path are YETI/YUSD and use the first and last amount parameter.
