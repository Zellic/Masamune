# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `awardExternalERC721()` function uses solidity's try and catch statement to ensure a single tokenId cannot deny function execution. If the try statement fails, an `ErrorAwardingExternalERC721` event is emitted with the relevant error, however, the failed tokenId is not removed from the list of tokenIds emitted at the end of function execution. As a result, the `AwardedExternalERC721` is emitted with the entire list of tokenIds, regardless of failure.  An off-chain script or user could therefore be tricked into thinking an ERC721 tokenId was successfully awarded.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/prize-pool/PrizePool.sol#L250-L270  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider emitting only successfully transferred tokenIds in the `AwardedExternalERC721` event.
