# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  Core system logic can break up if enumeration structure be updated.  ## Proof of Concept  BorrowerOperations and StabilityPool check the active status of a trove by comparing TroveManager's getTroveStatus with 1: BorrowerOperations: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol#L902 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol#L907 StabilityPool: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/StabilityPool.sol#L1104  TroveManagers inherit Status enumeration from TroveManagerBase: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/Dependencies/TroveManagerBase.sol#L72  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  With further system development it will be harder to track fixes needed on enumeration change. Consider implementing TroveManager.isTroveActive(borrower) where trove.status is checked against Status.active and the corresponding boolean is returned.
