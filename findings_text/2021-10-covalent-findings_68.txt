# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The mapping `validators` is defined with `uint` (alias for `uint256`) as key  type.  In the functions receiving the `validatorId` as parameter however, the  `validatorId` is defined as `uint128`.  See lines [166](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/main/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L166), [214](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/main/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L214).  The suggestion is to be consistent with the integer size.
