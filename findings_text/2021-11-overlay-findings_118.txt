# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Contract OverlayTokenNew inherits a functionality of the Context contract of OpenZeppelin: ```solidity   contract OverlayTokenNew is Context ``` Context is designed to be used with Ethereum Gas Station Network (GSN), thus it encourages to use _msgSender() instead of msg.sender: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Context.sol  OverlayTokenNew mixes usage of msg.sender and _msgSender().  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider replacing msg.sender with _msgSender() or getting rid of Context inheritance to save some gas if you don't actually need it.
