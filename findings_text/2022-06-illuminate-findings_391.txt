Basically making lending via these external PTs unusable.   ## Proof of Concept There is no minting of iPTs to the lender (or at all) in the 2 `lend` functions below: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L247-L305 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L317-L367  Corresponding to lending of (respectively): swivel element  Furthermore, in: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L227-L234 Comment says "Purchase illuminate PTs directly to msg.sender", but this is not happening. sending yield PTs at best.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Mint the appropriate amount of iPTs to the lender - like in the rest of the lend functions.
