# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  Certain ERC20 tokens make modifications to their ERC20's `transfer` or `balanceOf` functions. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.  ## Impact The `Bonding._bond()` function will revert in the `_balanceCheck` when transferring a fee-on-transfer token as it assumes the entire `amount` was received.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps To support fee-on-transfer tokens, measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring calls and use the difference as the actual bonded amount.
