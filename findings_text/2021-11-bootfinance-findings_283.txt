# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function claim can save gas and eliminate duplicate storage access and math operations by caching claimableAmount and re-using it later when setting the benClaimed.   before:   uint256 amount = _claimableAmount(msg.sender).sub(benClaimed[msg.sender]);   ...   benClaimed[msg.sender] = benClaimed[msg.sender].add(amount);  after:   uint256 claimableAmount = _claimableAmount(msg.sender);   uint256 amount = claimableAmount.sub(benClaimed[msg.sender]);   ...   benClaimed[msg.sender] = claimableAmount;  Also, it looks strange that in function revoke the amount is checked with 'assert': assert(amount <= benTotal[_addr]); but in function claim 'require' is used: require(amount <= benTotal[msg.sender], "Cannot withdraw more than total vested amount");  In both places probably 'assert' should be used as it is checking a scenario that should never happen under normal circumstances.
