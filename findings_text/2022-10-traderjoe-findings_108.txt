However, this wrong call is very dangerous for future extensions or protocol that built on top of the protocol / fork it.  ## Proof Of Concept Let's say the protocol is extended with some logic that needs to track mints / burns. The canonical way to do this would be: ```solidity function _beforeTokenTransfer(         address _from,         address _to,         uint256 _id,         uint256 _amount     ) internal override(LBToken) {  if (_from == address(0)) {   // Mint Logic  } else if (_to == address(0)) {   // Burn Logic  } } ``` Such an extension would break, which could lead to loss of funds or a bricked system.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Call the hook correctly: ```solidity _beforeTokenTransfer(_account, address(0), _id, _amount); ```
