# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L733-L735  ```solidity function arbitraryCall(address who, bytes memory data) public lock externallyGoverned {     // cannot have an active incentive for the callee     require(incentives[who] == 0, "inc");     ... ```  When an incentiveToken is claimed after `endStream`, `incentives[who]` will be `0` for that `incentiveToken`.  If the protocol gov is malicious or compromised, they can call `arbitraryCall()` with the address of the incentiveToken as `who` and `transferFrom()` as calldata and steal all the incentiveToken in the victim's wallet balance up to the allowance amount.  ### PoC  1. Alice approved `USDC` to the streaming contract; 2. Alice called `createIncentive()` and added `1,000 USDC` of incentive; 3. After the stream is done, the stream creator called `claimIncentive()` and claimed `1,000 USDC`;  The compromised protocol gov can call `arbitraryCall()` and steal all the USDC in Alice's wallet balance.  ### Recommendation  Consider adding a mapping: `isIncentiveToken`, setting `isIncentiveToken[incentiveToken] = true` in `createIncentive()`, and `require(!isIncentiveToken[who], ...)` in `arbitraryCall()`.
