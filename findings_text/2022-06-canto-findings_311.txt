Setting the severity to medium as this is conditional to transfer flow control introduction on future upgrades, but the impact is up to the full loss of the available funds by unrestricted borrowing.  ## Proof of Concept  CNote runs doTransferOut before borrowing accounts are updated:  https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/2d423c7c3f62d65182d802deb99cc7bba4e057fd/contracts/CNote.sol#L70-L87  ```         /*          * We invoke doTransferOut for the borrower and the borrowAmount.          *  Note: The cToken must handle variations between ERC-20 and ETH underlying.          *  On success, the cToken borrowAmount less of cash.          *  doTransferOut reverts if anything goes wrong, since we can't be sure if side effects occurred.          */         doTransferOut(borrower, borrowAmount);         require(getCashPrior() == 0,"CNote::borrowFresh: Error in doTransferOut, impossible Liquidity in LendingMarket");     //Amount minted by Accountant is always flashed from account          /* We write the previously calculated values into storage */         accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;         accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;         totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;          /* We emit a Borrow event */         emit Borrow(borrower, borrowAmount, accountBorrowsNew, totalBorrowsNew);     } ```  Call sequence here is borrow() -> borrowInternal() -> borrowFresh() -> doTransferOut(), which transfers the token to an external recipient:  https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/2d423c7c3f62d65182d802deb99cc7bba4e057fd/contracts/CErc20.sol#L189-L200  ```     /**      * @dev Similar to EIP20 transfer, except it handles a False success from `transfer` and returns an explanatory      *      error code rather than reverting.
