# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `_computeSingleOutGivenPoolIn` function of `IndexPool` uses the raw multiplication (i.e., `*`) to calculate the `zaz` variable. However, since both `(BASE - normalizedWeight)` and `_swapFee` are in `WAD`, the `_mul` function should be used instead to calculate the correct value of `zaz`. Otherwise, `zaz` would be `10 ** 18` times larger than the expected value and causes an integer underflow when calculating `amountOut`. The incorrect usage of multiplication prevents anyone from calling the function successfully.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [IndexPool.sol#L282](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/IndexPool.sol#L282)   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change `(BASE - normalizedWeight) * _swapFee` to `_mul((BASE - normalizedWeight), _swapFee)`.
