This can lead to loss of user funds as user might be paying extra  ## Proof of Concept 1. User is making a repayment which eventually calls repayBorrowFresh function  2. Assuming repayAmount == type(uint).max, so repayAmountFinal becomes accountBorrowsPrev  3. This means User should only transfer in accountBorrowsPrev instead of repayAmount but that is not true. Contract is transferring repayAmount instead of repayAmountFinal as seen at CNote.sol#L129  ``` uint actualRepayAmount = doTransferIn(payer, repayAmount); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Revise CNote.sol#L129 to below:  ``` uint actualRepayAmount = doTransferIn(payer, repayAmountFinal); ```
