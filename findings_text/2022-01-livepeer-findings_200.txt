# Handle  Jujic   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The    initialize    function   does   not   check   if   the   `_bondingManager`   are   all   non-zero   addresses.   If   all  the   initialized   `_bondingManager`   happen   to   be   0,   the   contract   will   have   to   be redeployed.  The  contract are initialized, but their critical init parameters are not logged for any off-chain monitoring.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/pool/DelegatorPool.sol#L47-L51  ``` function initialize(address _bondingManager) public initializer {         bondingManager = _bondingManager;         migrator = msg.sender;         initialStake = pendingStake();     } ``` Most contracts use initialize() functions instead of constructor given the delegatecall proxy pattern. While most of them emit an event in the critical initialize() functions to record the init parameters for off-chain monitoring and transparency reasons, DelegatorPool.sol not emit such an event in their initialize() function.    ## Tools Used https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/68 ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add check for zero address and emit event.
