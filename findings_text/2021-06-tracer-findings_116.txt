# Handle  tensors   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The contracts assume that all tokens will have <=18 decimals. If the Tracer team are the only people deploying the contracts, and they keep this in mind, this isn't a problem. If the contracts are to be deployed by other people, this assumption should be made explicit and hard-coded.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L220-L232 We can see that the scaler computations will underflow and be defined when it should not be.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Write a require check that ensures tokenDecimals <= 18 before running the above functions.
