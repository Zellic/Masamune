Scenario 1. 1. Address A(non-strategy) stakes some amount x and it will be added to StakerVault_poolTotalStaked. 2. This address A is approved as a strategy by StakerVault.inflationManager. 3. Address A tries to unstake amount x, it will be deducted from StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked because this address is a strategy already. Even if it would succeed for this strategy but it will revert for other strategies because StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked is less than correct staked amount for strategies.  Scenario 2. There is a transfer between strategy and non-strategy using StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom() functions. In this case, StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked and StakerVault._poolTotalStaked must be changed accordingly but there is no such logic.  ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps You need to modify 3 functions. StakerVault.addStrategy(), StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().  1. You need to move staked amount from StakerVault._poolTotalStaked to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked every time when StakerVault.inflationManager approves a new strategy. You can modify addStrategy() at L98-L102 like this.  function addStrategy(address strategy) external override returns (bool) {     require(msg.sender == address(inflationManager), Error.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS);     require(!strategies[strategy], Error.ADDRESS_ALREADY_SET);      strategies[strategy] = true;     _poolTotalStaked -= balances[strategy];     strategiesTotalStaked += balances[strategy];      return true; }  2. You need to add below code at L126 of transfer() function.  if(strategies[msg.sender] != strategies[account]) {     if(strategies[msg.sender]) { // from strategy to non-strategy         _poolTotalStaked += amount;         strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;     }     else { // from non-strategy to strategy         _poolTotalStaked -= amount;         strategiesTotalStaked += amount;     } }  3. You need to add below code at L170 of transferFrom() function.  if(strategies[src] != strategies[dst]) {     if(strategies[src]) { // from strategy to non-strategy         _poolTotalStaked += amount;         strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;     }     else { // from non-strategy to strategy         _poolTotalStaked -= amount;         strategiesTotalStaked += amount;     } }
