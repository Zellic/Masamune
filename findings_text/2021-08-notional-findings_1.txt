# Handle  Omik   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The implementation of the transfer function in the https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol is the different from the usual erc20 token transfer function, this happen because it count the incentive that the user get, but the with self tranfer it can lead to unlimited mint, because https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L278 it makes the amount to negative, but in the https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L279 it return the value to amount that not negative, so in the https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L281-282 it finalize the positive value only since the negative value is change to the positive value, you can interact this transfer function through https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/adapters/nTokenERC20Proxy.sol  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub.
