# Handle  Meta0xNull   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact      * [WARNING]      * ====      * This function should only be called from the constructor when setting      * up the initial roles for the system.      *      * Using this function in any other way is effectively circumventing the admin      * system imposed by {AccessControl}.      * ====      *      * NOTE: This function is deprecated in favor of {_grantRole}.  There are multiple contracts that import Permissions.sol and using Deprecated Function _setupRole() with Security Problem that Applicable to all these contracts because all of the contracts use initialize() Rather Than Constructor.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol#L174-L186 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Permissions.sol#L53 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Permissions.sol#L117 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Permissions.sol#L121  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace _setupRole() with _grantRole()
