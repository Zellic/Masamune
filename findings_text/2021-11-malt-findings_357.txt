# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact I think this if check is incorrect, because in theory maxAmount parameter can be greater than totalMaltBalance: ```solidity     if (rewards <= deployedCapital && maxAmount != totalMaltBalance) {       // If all malt is spent we want to reset deployed capital       deployedCapital = deployedCapital - rewards;     } else {       deployedCapital = 0;     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps If my assumption is correct, the check should use balance, not maxAmount: ``solidity   balance != totalMaltBalance ``` Another possible solution: ``solidity   maxAmount <= totalMaltBalance ``` However, I think the best approach would be to eliminate 'balance' altogether: ```solidity   uint256 totalMaltBalance = malt.balanceOf(address(this));    if (totalMaltBalance == 0) {     return 0;   }    (uint256 basis,) = costBasis();    if (maxAmount > totalMaltBalance) {     maxAmount = totalMaltBalance;   }    malt.safeTransfer(address(dexHandler), maxAmount);   uint256 rewards = dexHandler.sellMalt();    if (rewards <= deployedCapital && maxAmount < totalMaltBalance) {     // If all malt is spent we want to reset deployed capital     deployedCapital = deployedCapital - rewards;   } else {     deployedCapital = 0;   }   ```
