# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The variable BASIS_POINTS in Buoy3Pool.sol is written in capitals, which is the naming convention for constants. However BASIS_POINTS isn't a constant, because it is updated in setBasisPointsLmit This is confusing when reading the code.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/contracts/pools/oracle/Buoy3Pool.sol#L30 uint256 public BASIS_POINTS = 20;   function setBasisPointsLmit(uint256 newLimit) external onlyOwner {         uint256 oldLimit = BASIS_POINTS;         BASIS_POINTS = newLimit;         emit LogNewBasisPointLimit(oldLimit, newLimit);     }  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change BASIS_POINTS  to something like: basisPoints
