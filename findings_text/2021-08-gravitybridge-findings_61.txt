# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `verifySig` function of `Gravity` calls the Solidity `ecrecover` function directly to verify the given signatures. However, the `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows malleable (non-unique) signatures and thus is susceptible to replay attacks.  Although a replay attack seems not possible here since the nonce is increased each time, ensuring the signatures are not malleable is considered a best practice (and so is checking `_signer != address(0)`, where `address(0)` means an invalid signature).  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Gravity.sol#L153](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L153)  [SWC-117: Signature Malleability](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117) [SWC-121: Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use the `recover` function from [OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol) for signature verification.
