# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L308-L310  ```solidity uint256 amount = IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr)             .withdrawETHToL1Migrator(); ```  `L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()` will call `IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawETHToL1Migrator()` to withdraw ETH from `BridgeMinter`.  However, the current implementation of `L1Migrator` is unable to receive ETH.  https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/20e7ebb86cdb4fe9285bf5fea02eb603e5d48805/contracts/token/BridgeMinter.sol#L94-L94  ```solidity (bool ok, ) = l1MigratorAddr.call.value(address(this).balance)(""); ```  A contract receiving Ether must have at least one of the functions below:  - `receive() external payable` - `fallback() external payable`  `receive()` is called if `msg.data` is empty, otherwise `fallback()` is called.  Because `L1Migrator` implement neither `receive()` or `fallback()`, the `call` at L94 will always revert.  ## Impact  All the ETH held by the `BridgeMinter` can get stuck in the contract.  ## Recommandation  Add `receive() external payable {}` in `L1Migrator`.
