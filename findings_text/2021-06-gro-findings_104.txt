# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `safetyCheck` function has several issues that impact how precise the checks are:  1. only checks if the `a/b` and `a/c` ratios are within `BASIS_POINTS`. By transitivity `b/c` is only within `2 * BASIS_POINTS` if `a/b` and `a/c` are in range. For a more precise check whether both USDC and USDT are within range, `b/c` must be checked as well.  2. If `a/b` is within range, this does not imply that `b/a` is within range. > "inverted ratios, a/b bs b/a, while producing different results should both reflect the same change in any one of the two underlying assets, but in opposite directions"  Example: `lastRatio = 1.0` `ratio: a = 1.0, b = 0.8` => `a/b = 1.25`, `b/a = 0.8` If `a/b` was used with a 20% range, it'd be out of range, but `b/a` is in range.  3. The natspec for the function states that it checks Curve and an external oracle, but no external oracle calls are checked, both `_ratio` and `lastRatio` are only from Curve. Only `_updateRatios` checks the oracle.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In addition, check if `b/c` is within `BASIS_POINTS`.
