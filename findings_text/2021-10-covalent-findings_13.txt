# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function _stake() initializes endEpoch using the value of rewardsLocked. Afterwards rewardsLocked is no longer used (because now endEpoch !=0)  So you can set rewardsLocked to 0 save a bit of gas.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/ded3aeb2476da553e8bb1fe43358b73334434737/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L171-L176  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Update to code of  _stake() to: if (endEpoch == 0) {            endEpoch = uint128(block.number) + rewardsLocked / allocatedTokensPerEpoch;            rewardsLocked = 0; // no longer used and saves a bit of gas }
