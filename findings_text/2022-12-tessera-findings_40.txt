(success, ) = _to.call{value: _value, gas: 30000}(""); } /// @notice Sends eth or weth to an address /// @param _to Address to send to /// @param _value Amount to send function _sendEthOrWeth(address _to, uint256 _value) internal {     if (!_attemptETHTransfer(_to, _value)) {         WETH(WETH_ADDRESS).deposit{value: _value}();         WETH(WETH_ADDRESS).transfer(_to, _value);     } } ```  The issue is that the receive could be a contract that does not have a fallback function. In this scenario, \_attemptETHTransfer will fail and WETH would be transferred to the contract. It is likely that it bricks those funds for the contract as there is no reason it would support interaction with WETH tokens.   It can be reasonably assumed that developers will develop contracts which will interact with OptimisticListingSeaport using proposals. They are not warned and are likely to suffer losses.  ## Impact  Loss of ETH for proposer when it is a contract that doesn't have fallback function.  ## Tools Used  Manual audit  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Either enforce that proposer is an EOA or take in a recipient address for ETH transfers.
