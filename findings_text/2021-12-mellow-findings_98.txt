# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  For `UniV3Vault`, it seems that lp fees are collected through `collectEarnings()` callable by the `strategy` and reinvested (rebalanced).  However, in the current implementation, unharvested yields are not included in `tvl()`, making it vulnerable to front-run attacks that steal pending yields.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/UniV3Vault.sol#L100-L122  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/UniV3Vault.sol#L80-L97  ### POC  Given:  - Current `tvl()` is `10 ETH` and `40,000 USDC`; - Current unclaimed yields (trading fees) is `1 ETH` and `4,000 USDC`;  1. `strategy` calls `collectEarnings()` to collect fees and reinvest; 2. The attacker sends a deposit tx with a higher gas price to deposit `10 ETH` and `40,000 USDC`, take 50% share of the pool; 3. After the transaction in step 1 is packed, the attacker calls `withdraw()` and retrieves `10.5 ETH` and `42,000 USDC`.  As a result, the attacker has stolen half of the pending yields in about 1 block of time.  ### Recommendation  Consider including fees in `tvl()`.  For the code to calculate fees earned, please reference `_computeFeesEarned()` in G-UNI project:  https://github.com/gelatodigital/g-uni-v1-core/blob/master/contracts/GUniPool.sol#L762-L806
