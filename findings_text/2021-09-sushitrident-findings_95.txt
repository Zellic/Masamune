# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ConstantProductPool` computes optimal balanced LP using `_nonOptimalMintFee`, which performs something like a swap. The returned swap fees should be included in the "`k`" computation as `_handleFees` uses the growth in `k` to estimate the swap fees.  ```solidity // should not reduce fee0 and fee1 uint256 computed = TridentMath.sqrt((balance0 - fee0) * (balance1 - fee1)); ```  > ⚠️ The same issue occurs in the `HybridPool.mint`.  ## Impact The non-optimal mint swap fees are not taken into account.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Compute `sqrt(k)` on the `balance0 * balance1` without deducting the swap fees.
