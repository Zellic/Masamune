# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Wrong fateBalance bookkeeping for a user. Wrong fateCreated value emitted.  ## Proof of Concept Taking into account the FOT is done almost everywhere important in the solution already. That's a known practice in the solution.  However, it's missing here (see @audit-info tags): ``` File: LimboDAO.sol 383:   function burnAsset(address asset, uint256 amount) public isLive incrementFate { 384:     require(assetApproved[asset], "LimboDAO: illegal asset"); 385:     address sender = _msgSender(); 386:     require(ERC677(asset).transferFrom(sender, address(this), amount), "LimboDAO: transferFailed"); //@audit-info FOT not taken into account 387:     uint256 fateCreated = fateState[_msgSender()].fateBalance; 388:     if (asset == domainConfig.eye) { 389:       fateCreated = amount * 10; //@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation 390:       ERC677(domainConfig.eye).burn(amount);//@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation 391:     } else { 392:       uint256 actualEyeBalance = IERC20(domainConfig.eye).balanceOf(asset); 393:       require(actualEyeBalance > 0, "LimboDAO: No EYE"); 394:       uint256 totalSupply = IERC20(asset).totalSupply(); 395:       uint256 eyePerUnit = (actualEyeBalance * ONE) / totalSupply; 396:       uint256 impliedEye = (eyePerUnit * amount) / ONE;//@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation 397:       fateCreated = impliedEye * 20; 398:     } 399:     fateState[_msgSender()].fateBalance += fateCreated; //@audit-info potentially wrong fateCreated as fateCreated can be equal to amount * 10;   400:     emit assetBurnt(_msgSender(), asset, fateCreated);//@audit-info potentially wrong fateCreated emitted 401:   } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check the balance before and after the transfer to take into account the Fees-On-Transfer
