It would also be impossible to change the implementation address, as the `Singleton` functionality and the entire contract would be destroyed, leaving only the functionality from the Proxy contract accessible.  ---  In the deploy script there is the following logic:  ```typescript const SmartWallet = await ethers.getContractFactory("SmartAccount"); const baseImpl = await SmartWallet.deploy(); await baseImpl.deployed(); console.log("base wallet impl deployed at: ", baseImpl.address); ```  So, in the deploy script there is no enforce that the `SmartAccount` contract implementation was initialized.  The same situation in `scw-contracts/scripts/wallet-factory.deploy.ts` script.  ---  Please note, that in case only the possibility of initialization of the `SmartAccount` implementation will be banned it will be possible to use this attack. This is so because in such a case `owner` variable will be equal to zero and it will be easy to pass a check inside of `checkSignatures` function using the fact that for incorrect input parameters `ecrecover` returns a zero address.  ## Impact  Complete freezing of all functionality of all wallets (including complete funds freezing).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add to the deploy script initialization of the `SmartAccount` implementation, or add to the `SmartAccount` contract the following constructor that will prevent implementation contract from the initialization:  ```solidity= // Constructor ensures that this implementation contract can not be initialized constructor() public {     owner = address(1); } ```
