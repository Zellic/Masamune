# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `Utils.getInterestOwed` function computes the `_interestPayment` as:  ```solidity uint256 _interestPayment =   calcShare(       timeElapsed,       _year,       getInterestPayment(collateralAsset, debtAsset)   ); // Share of the payment over 1 year ```  However, `calcShare` caps `timeElpased` to `_year` and therefore the owed interest does not grow after a year has elapsed.  ## Impact  The impact is probably small because the only call so far computes the elapsed time as `block.timestamp - mapCollateralAsset_NextEra[collateralAsset][debtAsset];` which most likely will never go beyond a year.  It's still recommended to fix the logic bug in case more functions will be added that use the broken function.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use a different function than `calcShare` that does not cap.
