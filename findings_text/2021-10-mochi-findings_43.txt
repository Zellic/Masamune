# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Caching the "vesting" state variable instead of repeatedly reading and writing it will decrease deployment and runtime gas.  This is especially true for the modifier "checkClaimable" which is used on every function in the contract.   ## Proof of Concept  The checkClaimable function is here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/emission/VestedRewardPool.sol#L22-L29  An example of its use is here along with many other accesses to the "vesting" state variable. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/emission/VestedRewardPool.sol#L36-L46  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  I suggest modifying "checkClaimable as follows:     <code> function checkClaimable(Vesting memory v) internal pure returns(Vesting memory) {   if (v.ends < block.timestamp) {   v.claimable += v.vested;   v.vested = 0;   v.ends = 0;  }  return v; } </code>  and I suggest these changes to function "vest"   <code> function vest(address _recipient) external {  Vesting memory v = checkClaimable(vesting[_recipient]);  uint256 amount = mochi.balanceOf(address(this)) - mochiUnderManagement;  uint256 weightedEnd = (v.vested *   v.ends +   amount *   (block.timestamp + 90 days)) /   (v.vested + amount);  v.vested += amount;  v.ends = weightedEnd;  vesting[_recipient] = v;  mochiUnderManagement += amount; } </code>  These functions are also candidates for similar changes: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/8458209a52565875d8b2cefcb611c477cefb9253/projects/mochi-core/contracts/emission/VestedRewardPool.sol#L48-L71
