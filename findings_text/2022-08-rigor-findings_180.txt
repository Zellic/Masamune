This allows a builder to drastically decrease the amount of interest paid to a community owner, which in turn allows them to advertise very high APR rates to secure funding, most of which they will not pay.  This issue occurs in the calculation of `noOfDays` in `returnToLender()` which calculates the number of days since interest has last been calculated. If a builder repays a very small amount of tokens every 1.9999 days, then the `noOfDays` will be rounded down to `1 days` however `lastTimestamp` is updated to the current timestamp anyway, so the builder essentially accumulates only 1 day of interest after 2 days.  I believe this is high severity because a community owner can have a drastic decrease in interest gained from a loan which counts as lost rewards. Additionally, this problem does not require a malicious builder because if a builder pays at a wrong time, the loaner receives less interest anyway.  ## Proof of Concept 1. A community owner provides a loan of 500_000 tokens to a builder with an APR of 10% (ignoring treasury fees) 2. Therefore, the community owner will expect an interest of 136.9 tokens per day (273.9 per 2 days) 3. A builder repays 0.000001 tokens at `lastTimestamp + 2*86400 - 1` 4. `noOfDays` rounds down to 1 thereby accumulating `500_000 * 100 * 1 / 365000 = 136` tokens for 2 days 5. Therefore, the community owner only receives 5% APR with negligible expenses for the builder ## Tools Used VS Code ## Recommended Mitigation Steps There are two possible mitigations: 1. Add a scalar to `noOfDays` so that any rounding which occurs is negligible i.e. ```solidity         uint256 _noOfDays = (block.timestamp -             _communityProject.lastTimestamp) * SCALAR / 86400; // 24*60*60           /// Interest formula = (principal * APR * days) / (365 * 1000)         // prettier-ignore         uint256 _unclaimedInterest =                  _lentAmount *                 _communities[_communityID].projectDetails[_project].apr *                 _noOfDays /                 365000 /                 SCALAR; ``` 2. Remove the `noOfDays` calculation and calculate interest in one equation which reduces arithmetic rounding ```solidity uint256 _unclaimedInterest =                  _lentAmount *                 _communities[_communityID].projectDetails[_project].apr *                 (block.timestamp -             _communityProject.lastTimestamp) /                 365000 /                 86400; ```
