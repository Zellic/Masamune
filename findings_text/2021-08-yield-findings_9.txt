# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The contract Wand defines a few role constants with bytes4(keccak256("...function...")) However if the function template would change slightly, for example when uint128 is replaced by uint256, then this construction isn't valid anymore.  It is safer the use the function selector, as is done in EmergencyBrake.sol  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/Wand.sol#L27      bytes4 public constant JOIN = bytes4(keccak256("join(address,uint128)"));     bytes4 public constant EXIT = bytes4(keccak256("exit(address,uint128)"));     bytes4 public constant MINT = bytes4(keccak256("mint(address,uint256)"));     bytes4 public constant BURN = bytes4(keccak256("burn(address,uint256)"));  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/utils/EmergencyBrake.sol#L35   _grantRole(IEmergencyBrake.plan.selector, planner);  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use function selectors in Wand.sol
