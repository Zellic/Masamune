# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The "else if", the second call to _processWithdrawal, and the return statement can be eliminated to reduce gas and improve code clarity.  ## Proof of Concept  The _withdrawShare function is here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/tge/contracts/PublicSale.sol#L201-L210  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I recommend rewriting it as follows: <code>  function _withdrawShare (uint _era, uint _day, address _member) private returns (uint value) {  _updateEmission();    if (_era < currentEra ||                                                          // Allow if in previous Era                                                                          (_era == currentEra && _day < currentDay)) {                // or current Era and previous day    value = _processWithdrawal(_era, _day, _member);   // Process Withdrawal      }   } </code>
