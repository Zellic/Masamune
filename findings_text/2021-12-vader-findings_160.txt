# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Oracles are mapped to the `foreignAsset` but not to the specific pair. Pairs with the same `foreignAsset` (e.g. UniswapV2 and Sushi) will be forced to use the same oracle. Generally this should be the expected behavior but there are also possibility that while adding a new pair changed the oracle of an older pair unexpectedly.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/9fb7f206eaff1863aeeb8f997e0f21ea74e78b49/contracts/lbt/LiquidityBasedTWAP.sol#L271 ```         oracles[foreignAsset] = oracle; ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Bind the oracle to pair instead
