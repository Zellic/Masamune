# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ATokenYieldSource.redeemToken` function burns `aTokens` and sends out underlying, however, it's used in a reverse way in the code: The `balanceDiff` is used as the `depositToken` that is transferred out but it's computed on the **aTokens** that were burned instead of on the `depositToken` received.  ## Impact  It should not directly lead to issues as aTokens are 1-to-1 with their underlying but we still recommend doing it correctly to make the code more robust against any possible rounding issues.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Compute `balanceDiff` on the underyling balance (depositToken), not on the aToken. Subtract the actual burned aTokens from the user shares.
