# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The setDecimals() in the sample Gas Price Oracle implementation allows anyone to set the decimals value used by the contract but is not used anywhere.  Impact: It is unclear if this should be set by anyone and if that value should be used in determining the precision of the values returned.  ## Proof of Concept   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/oracle/GasOracle.sol#L64-L66   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Evaluate if this access and missing logic is correct.
