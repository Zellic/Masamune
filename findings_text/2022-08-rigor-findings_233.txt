But it might revert when this function is called after a dispute because it takes a certain time to resolve disputes and other tasks might be added meanwhile.   ## Proof of Concept The below scenario would be possible.  - A project contains 10 active tasks(taskCount = 10) and a builder and contractor are going to add one more task. - There were some disagreements between a builder and contractor so they raised a dispute with _taskCount = 10 using [raiseDispute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L493). - Normally it would take a certain time(like 1 day or more) to resolve the dispute as it must be done by HomeFi owner. - Meanwhile, if the builder and contractor need to add another task, they should set `_taskCount = 10` and `taskCount` will be 11 after addition [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L260). - After that, the HomeFi admin agreed to add a task with `_taskCount = 10`, but it will revert [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238).  So currently, the project builder and contractor shouldn't add new tasks to make their previous dispute valid.  I think it's reasonable to modify that they can add other tasks even though there is an active dispute.   ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps I think we can modify not to compare [taskCount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238) when it's called from disputes contract.  So we can modify [this part](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238) like below.   ``` if (_msgSender() != disputes) {     require(_taskCount == taskCount, "Project::!taskCount"); } else {     _taskCount = taskCount; } ```
