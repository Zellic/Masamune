# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  On calling with arrays of different lengths various malfunctions are possible as the arrays are used as given. mintTo and swapTo outcome will not be as expected by a caller.  ## Proof of Concept  The arrays are used whenever Vault is ERC1155, i.e. when is1155 is true.  swap -> swapTo uses the arrays as given: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXVaultUpgradeable.sol#L258  mint -> mintTo, arrays are passed on without checks to receiveNFTs: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXVaultUpgradeable.sol#L190  receiveNFTs uses the arrays in a loop, assuming equal lengths without a check: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXVaultUpgradeable.sol#L389  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add `require(tokenIds.length == amounts.length, "tokenIds and amounts length should match")` check in the beginning of public mintTo and swapTo endpoints.
