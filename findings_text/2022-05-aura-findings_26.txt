# Lines of code  https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform/blob/9cae5eb5a77e73bbc1378ef213740c1889e2e8a3/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool4626.sol   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   BaseRewardPool4626 is not IERC4626 compliant. This makes the BaseRewardPool4626 contract irrelevant as it is for now since projects won't be able to integrate with BaseRewardPool4626 using the[eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard.   ## Suggestion  You can choose to remove the BaseRewardPool4626 and save on some deployment gas or review the necessary` functions` and `emits` required on [eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)  and add it to BaseRewardPool4626.
