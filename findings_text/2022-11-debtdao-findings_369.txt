Using Solidity's `transfer()` function has some notable shortcomings when the withdrawer is a smart contract, which can render ETH deposits impossible to withdraw. Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when: * The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function. * The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. * The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call’s gas usage above 2300.  Risks of reentrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the "Check-Effects-Interactions" pattern and using OpenZeppelin Contract’s ReentrancyGuard contract.   ## Proof of Concept  ```solidity // Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol 48:    payable(receiver).transfer(amount); ```   #### References:  The issues with `transfer()` are outlined [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/ )  For further reference on why using Solidity’s `transfer()` is no longer recommended, refer to these [articles](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).    ## Tools Used Manual analysis.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Using low-level `call.value(amount)` with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin `Address.sendValue` is advised, [reference](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L60).
