# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Pool delegates are trusted actors (see https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/wiki/Security#trust-assumptions) and so any change (additions/removals) in their validity should be recorded for off-chain monitoring. However, such an event emission is missing here.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/blob/355141befa89c7623150a83b7d56a5f5820819e9/contracts/MapleGlobals.sol#L232-L239  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Create and emit a suitable event to log pool delegate validity change in setPoolDelegateAllowlist function.
