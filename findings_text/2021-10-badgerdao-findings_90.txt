# Handle  hack3r-0m   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L73  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L123  oracle can `0` as a price of the share, in that case, 0 will be the denominator in some calculations which can cause reverts from SafeMath (for e.g here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L148 ) resulting in Denial Of Service.  Add a null check to ensure that on every update, the price is greater than 0.
