This contract is supposed to receive the native currency of the blockchain (for example ETH) and wrap it into a tokenized, ERC-20 form. This contract computes the `totalSupply()` using the balance of the contract itself stored in the `balanceOf` mapping, when instead it should be using the native `balance` function. This way, `totalSupply()` always returns zero as the `WETH` contract itself has no way of calling `deposit` to itself and increase its own balance  ## Proof of Concept  1. Alice transfers 100 ETH to `WETH.sol` 2. Alice calls `balanceOf()` for her address and it returns 100 WETH 3. Alice calls `totalSupply()`, expecting to see 100 WETH, but it returns 0  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx function totalSupply() public view returns (uint) {     return address(this).balance } ```
