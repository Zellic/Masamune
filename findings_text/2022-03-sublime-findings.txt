The other places where `minBorrowAmount` are used will not be affected by the change because:  - startTime has been zeroed, so `start()` cannot be invoked (revert with error S1) - credit line status would have been changed to `ACTIVE` and cannot be changed back to `REQUESTED`, meaning the check below will be false regardless of the value of `minBorrowAmount`.          ```jsx     _status == PooledCreditLineStatus.REQUESTED &&     block.timestamp > pooledCLConstants[_id].startTime &&     totalSupply[_id] < pooledCLConstants[_id].minBorrowAmount     ```       Code amendment example:  ```jsx  function _accept(uint256 _id, uint256 _amount) internal {   ...   // replace delete pooledCLConstants[_id].minBorrowAmount; with the following:   pooledCLConstants[_id].minInitialSupply = totalSupply[_id]; }  // update comment in _withdrawLiquidity // Case 1: Pooled credit line never started because desired amount wasn't reached // state will never revert back to REQUESTED if credit line is accepted so this case is never run  function _calculatePrincipalWithdrawable(uint256 _id, address _lender) internal view returns (uint256) {   uint256 _borrowedTokens = pooledCLConstants[_id].borrowLimit;   uint256 _totalLiquidityWithdrawable = _borrowedTokens.sub(POOLED_CREDIT_LINE.getPrincipal(_id));   // totalSupply[id] replaced with minInitialSupply   uint256 _principalWithdrawable = _totalLiquidityWithdrawable.mul(balanceOf(_lender, _id)).div(minInitialSupply);   return _principalWithdrawable; } ```  In `terminate()`, the shares withdrawable can simply be `_sharesHeld`.  ```jsx function terminate(uint256 _id, address _to) external override onlyPooledCreditLine nonReentrant {   address _strategy = pooledCLConstants[_id].borrowAssetStrategy;   address _borrowAsset = pooledCLConstants[_id].borrowAsset;   uint256 _sharesHeld = pooledCLVariables[_id].sharesHeld;    SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.withdrawShares(_borrowAsset, _strategy, _to, _sharesHeld, false);   delete pooledCLConstants[_id];   delete pooledCLVariables[_id]; } ```
