# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function _transfer in SherXERC20.sol allow transfer to address 0. This is usually considered the same as burning the tokens and the Emit is indistinguishable from an Emit of a burn.  However the burn function in LibSherXERC20.sol has extra functionality, which _transfer doesn't have. sx20.totalSupply = sx20.totalSupply.sub(_amount);  So it is safer to prevent _transfer to address 0 (which is also done in the openzeppelin erc20 contract) See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L226  Note: minting from address 0 will not work because that is blocked by the safemath sub in:  sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/SherXERC20.sol#L118 function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {     SherXERC20Storage.Base storage sx20 = SherXERC20Storage.sx20();     sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);     sx20.balances[_to] = sx20.balances[_to].add(_amount);     emit Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);   }  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibSherXERC20.sol#L29 function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) internal {     SherXERC20Storage.Base storage sx20 = SherXERC20Storage.sx20();     sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);     sx20.totalSupply = sx20.totalSupply.sub(_amount);     emit Transfer(_from, address(0), _amount);   } ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps add something like to following to _transfer of SherXERC20.sol:         require(_to!= address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");  Or update sx20.totalSupply if burning a desired operation.
