# Handle  bw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `AaveV2.sol` contract made use of a number of `public` variables that were set only in the constructor and would remain constant. These variables were consuming storage slots, which unnecessarily increased the deployment and runtime gas costs of the contract.  ## Proof of Concept  ### Code Diff  ``` diff --git a/contracts/strategies/AaveV2.sol b/contracts/strategies/AaveV2.sol index 1b6ed56..9592986 100644 --- a/contracts/strategies/AaveV2.sol +++ b/contracts/strategies/AaveV2.sol @@ -21,15 +21,15 @@ import '../interfaces/IStrategy.sol';

Add the `constant` modifier for `lpAddressProvider`.
