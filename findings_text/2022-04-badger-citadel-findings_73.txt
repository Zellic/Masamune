This might lead to accidental collisions or front-running attacks when user is trying to buy the tokens and his transaction is being included after the transaction of changing the price of the token via `setTokenOutPrice`.  Scenario: 1. User wants to `buy` tokens and can see price `tokenOutPrice` 2. User likes the price and issues a transaction to `buy` tokens 3. At the same time `CONTRACT_GOVERNANCE_ROLE` account is increasing `tokenOutPrice` through `setTokenOutPrice` 4. `setTokenOutPrice` transaction is included before user's `buy` transaction 5. User buys tokens with the price he was not aware of  Another variation of this attack can be performed using front-running.  ## Proof of Concept * https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/18f8c392b6fc303fe95602eba6303725023e53da/src/KnightingRound.sol#L162-L204  ## Tools Used Manual Review / VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It is recommended to add additional parameter `uint256 believedPrice` to `KnightingRound.buy` function and check if `believedPrice` is equal to `tokenOutPrice`.
