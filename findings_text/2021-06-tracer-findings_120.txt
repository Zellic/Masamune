# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  For every new TracerPerpetualSwaps contract, we need to deploy a new Liquidation, Insurance, and Pricing contract.  All these deployments are really gas-intensive, so it would be recommended to use EIP-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract to reduce the gas cost of the deployments.  ```solidity function _deployTracer(         bytes calldata _data,         address tracerOwner,         address oracle,         address fastGasOracle,         uint256 maxLiquidationSlippage     ) internal returns (address) {         // Create and link tracer to factory         address market = IPerpsDeployer(perpsDeployer).deploy(_data);         ITracerPerpetualSwaps tracer = ITracerPerpetualSwaps(market);          validTracers[market] = true;         tracersByIndex[tracerCounter] = market;         tracerCounter++;          // Instantiate Insurance contract for tracer         address insurance = IInsuranceDeployer(insuranceDeployer).deploy(market);         address pricing = IPricingDeployer(pricingDeployer).deploy(market, insurance, oracle);         address liquidation = ILiquidationDeployer(liquidationDeployer).deploy(             pricing,             market,             insurance,             fastGasOracle,             maxLiquidationSlippage         );          // Perform admin operations on the tracer to finalise linking         tracer.setInsuranceContract(insurance);         tracer.setPricingContract(pricing);         tracer.setLiquidationContract(liquidation);          // Ownership either to the deployer or the DAO         tracer.transferOwnership(tracerOwner);         ILiquidation(liquidation).transferOwnership(tracerOwner);         emit TracerDeployed(tracer.marketId(), address(tracer));         return market;     } ```   More info: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/deep-dive-into-the-minimal-proxy-contract/ https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167
