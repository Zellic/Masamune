# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Suppose one of the supplied addrs[i] to the constructor of Identity.sol happens to be 0 ( by accident).  In that case: privileges[0] = 1  Now suppose you call execute() with an invalid signature, then recoverAddrImpl will return a value of 0 and thus signer=0. If you then check "privileges[signer] !=0"  this will be true and anyone can perform any transaction.  This is clearly an unwanted situation.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/Identity.sol#L23-L30  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/Identity.sol#L97-L98  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In the constructor of Identity.sol, add in the for loop the following: require (addrs[i] !=0,"Zero not allowed");
