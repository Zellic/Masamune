# Handle  Ruhum   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact View functions consume less gas. `WJLP.getPendingRewards()` is technically also a view function but not specified as one. Because the `IMasterChefJoeV2` interface used by the contract is wrong. It says `poolInfo()` is not a view function, which it is.  ## Proof of Concept getPendingRewards: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L190  Faulty interface function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L29  actually poolinfo is just an array so its getter is a view function: https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/MasterChefJoeV2.sol#L85  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Step Declare both functions as `view` to save gas
