But, it doesn't use any slippage checks. The swap is at risk of being frontrun / sandwiched which will result in a loss of funds.  Since MEV is very prominent I think the chance of that happening is pretty high.  ## Proof of Concept Here's the swap: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/CvxCrvRewardsLocker.sol#L247-L252  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use a proper value for `minOut` instead of `0`.
