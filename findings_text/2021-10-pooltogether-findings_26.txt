# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Reserve` does not correctly use ring buffers to get the oldest / newest elements if the array is full (observations larger than cardinality) in which case it should wrap around.  `getReserveAccumulatedBetween` always picks `reserveAccumulators[_cardinality - 1]`. `_checkpoint` tries to write to `reserveAccumulators[cardinality++]` which will break once `cardinality` reaches `MAX_CARDINALITY`.  The `TwabLib` library has a correct `oldestTwab/newestTwab` implementation using the `RingBufferLib` that wraps around if needed.  ## Impact Anyone can send 1 wei to the reserve and call `checkpoint` on it until the `MAX_CARDINALITY` is reached. Afterwards, trying to write any new checkpoints will fail as `_checkpoint` now tries to write to `cardinality=MAX_CARDINALITY+1` which is out of bounds of the `reserveAccumulators`.  The reserve is broken and cannot withdraw funds anymore. The gas costs for such an attack are very high and would take ~7 years if writing every block, making it probably not worth fixing.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Correctly implement the ring buffer usage like in `TwabLib`.
