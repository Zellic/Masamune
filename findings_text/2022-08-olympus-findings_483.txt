For example, `10000` moves of `990` size, `numObservations = 1000`. This will yield `0` on each update, while must yield `9900` increase in the moving average.  ## Proof of Concept  Moving average is calculated with the addition of the difference:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L134-L139  ```solidity         // Calculate new moving average         if (currentPrice > earliestPrice) {             _movingAverage += (currentPrice - earliestPrice) / numObs;         } else {             _movingAverage -= (earliestPrice - currentPrice) / numObs;         } ```  `/ numObs` can lose precision as `currentPrice - earliestPrice` is usually small.  It is returned on request as is:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193  ```solidity     /// @notice Get the moving average of OHM in the Reserve asset over the defined window (see movingAverageDuration and observationFrequency).     function getMovingAverage() external view returns (uint256) {         if (!initialized) revert Price_NotInitialized();         return _movingAverage;     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider storing the cumulative `sum`, while returning `sum / numObs` on request:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193  ```solidity     /// @notice Get the moving average of OHM in the Reserve asset over the defined window (see movingAverageDuration and observationFrequency).     function getMovingAverage() external view returns (uint256) {         if (!initialized) revert Price_NotInitialized(); -       return _movingAverage; +       return _movingAverage / numObservations;     } ```
