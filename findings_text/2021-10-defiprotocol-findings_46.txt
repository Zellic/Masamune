# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It is possible to minimize the number of storage slots used by rearranging the state variables in a more efficient way.  ## Proof of Concept In Auction.sol: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol/blob/7ca848f2779e2e64ed0b4756c02f0137ecd73e50/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L16-L28  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Arrange the bool and address variables such that they fit into the same slot. For example: <code>     uint256 private constant BASE = 1e18;     uint256 private constant ONE_DAY = 4 * 60 * 24; // one day in blocks          bool public override auctionOngoing;     bool public override hasBonded;     bool public override initialized;     address public override auctionBonder;          uint256 public override auctionStart; </code>
