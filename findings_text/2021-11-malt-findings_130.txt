# Handle  jayjonah8   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The setupParticipant() function in AuctionParticipant.sol does not have require statements to protect again contracts that do not yet exist.  It sets the addresses for " _impliedCollateralService", "_rewardToken", and "_auction" and can only be called once so its vital to have this guard in place.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/AuctionParticipant.sol#L26  ## Tools Used Manual code review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add require checks for the addresses that are passed in the setupParticipant() function checking if they exist like: require("address" != address(0), "contract does not exist")
