# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/test_brownie/contracts/YearnVault.sol#L84-L101  ```solidity=84     for (uint256 i = 0; i < _yTokens.length; i++) {         if (tokenAmounts[i] == 0) {             continue;         }          IYearnVault yToken = IYearnVault(_yTokens[i]);         uint256 yTokenAmount = ((tokenAmounts[i] * (10**yToken.decimals())) / yToken.pricePerShare());         uint256 balance = yToken.balanceOf(address(this));         if (yTokenAmount > balance) {             yTokenAmount = balance;         }         if (yTokenAmount == 0) {             continue;         }         yToken.withdraw(yTokenAmount, to, maxLoss);         (tokenAmounts[i], address(this));     }     actualTokenAmounts = tokenAmounts; ```  The actual token withdrew from `yToken.withdraw()` will most certainly be less than the `tokenAmounts[i]`, due to precision loss in the calculation of `yTokenAmount`.  As a result, `IERC20(_vaultTokens[i]).safeTransfer(to, actualTokenAmounts[i]);` in `LpIssuer.sol#withdraw()` will revert due to insufficant balance.   ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity=98 tokenAmounts[i] = yToken.withdraw(yTokenAmount, to, maxLoss); ```
