However, the current protocol implementation is missing to deduct fees for exercised put options. Put options are free of any fees.  ## Proof of Concept  The protocol fee is correctly charged for exercised calls:  [PuttyV2.withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L494-L506)  ```solidity // transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {     // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%     uint256 feeAmount = 0;     if (fee > 0) {         feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;         ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount); // @audit DoS due to reverting erc20 token transfer (weird erc20 tokens, blacklisted or paused owner; erc777 hook on owner receiver side can prevent transfer hence reverting and preventing withdrawal) - use pull pattern @high  // @audit zero value token transfers can revert. Small strike prices and low fee can lead to rounding down to 0 - check feeAmount > 0 @high  // @audit should not take fees if renounced owner (zero address) as fees can not be withdrawn @medium     }      ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount); // @audit fee should not be paid if strike is simply returned to short owner for expired put @high      return; } ```  Contrary, put options are free of any fees:  [PuttyV2.sol#L450-L451](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L450-L451)  ```solidity // transfer strike from putty to exerciser ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike); ```  ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended mitigation steps  Charge fees also for exercised put options.
