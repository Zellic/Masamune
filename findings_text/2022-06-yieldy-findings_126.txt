Therefore, the rebase function should also be called in the unstake/claim/claimWithdraw function of the Staking contract. ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L674-L696 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/Staking.sol#L465-L508 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps ```     function claim(address _recipient) public {         Claim memory info = warmUpInfo[_recipient]; +      rebase(); ...     function claimWithdraw(address _recipient) public {         Claim memory info = coolDownInfo[_recipient]; +      rebase(); ...     function unstake(uint256 _amount, bool _trigger) external {         // prevent unstaking if override due to vulnerabilities asdf         require(!isUnstakingPaused, "Unstaking is paused"); -        if (_trigger) {             rebase(); -        } ```
