# Handle  tensors   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Registering tokens that aren't properly vetted can lead to a loss of funds if the token has callbacks.  CREAM finance got hacked in a similar way because the ampleforth token had a callback in the transfer method that wasn't noticed when they vetted it.   ## Proof of Concept For example, the redeem function is vulnerable to such a reentrancy in the balanceOf method, since address balances aren't updated before the token call.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/4b51b0de2b448e4d36809781c097c7bc373312e9/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L131   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either: - Add nonreentrant modifiers - Update all storage variables before making outside calls with the token - Put steps in place for devs to properly vet tokens.
