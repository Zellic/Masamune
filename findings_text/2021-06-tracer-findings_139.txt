# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `getHourlyAvgTracerPrice` and `getHourlyAvgOraclePrice` functions in `Pricing` return 0 if there is no trade during the given `hour` because of the design of `averagePrice`, which could mislead users that the hourly average price is 0. The same problem happens when emitting the old hourly average in the `recordTrade` function.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Pricing.sol#L254-L256](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L254-L256) [Pricing.sol#L262-L264](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L262-L264) [Pricing.sol#L74](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/Pricing.sol#L74)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Return a special value (e.g., `type(uint256).max`) from `averagePrice` if there is no trade during the specified hour to distinguish from an actual zero price. Handle this particular value whenever the `averagePrice` function is called by others.
