# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the `burn` and `swap` functions of `ConcentratedLiquidityPool`, the lower tick is not explicitly checked to be less than the upper tick. Besides, the ticks are not checked to be at least the minimum tick and at most the maximum tick.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Ticks.sol#L68-L70](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/libraries/concentratedPool/Ticks.sol#L68-L70)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add sanity checks on the lower and upper ticks in critical functions (see the referenced line of code, for example).
