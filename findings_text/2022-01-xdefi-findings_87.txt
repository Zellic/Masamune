# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Extra gas costs from unnecessary casting.  ## Proof of Concept  `pointsCorrection` is stored as a int256 variable.  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/interfaces/IXDEFIDistribution.sol#L15  However we can see that this variable is always negative (`_pointsPerUnit` and  `units` are both positive)  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L277  The only usage of `pointsCorrection` is in the `_withdrawableGiven` function as shown below.  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L341-L342  ``` (   _toUint256Safe(       _toInt256Safe(_pointsPerUnit * uint256(units_)) +       pointsCorrection_   ) / _pointsMultiplier ) + uint256(depositedXDEFI_); ```  `pointsCorrection` is set to `_pointsPerUnit * uint256(units_)` when locking and `_pointsPerUnit` only increases so we can safely store `pointsCorrection as a positive uint256 (note this is an assumption of the original code as well) and simplify the above expression.  ``` // notice the sign change before `pointsCorrection_` (_pointsPerUnit * uint256(units_) - pointsCorrection_) / _pointsMultiplier + uint256(depositedXDEFI_); ```  We can then remove a significant amount of casting along with the associated costs.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  store `pointsCorrection` in a uint256 and subtract rather than add.
