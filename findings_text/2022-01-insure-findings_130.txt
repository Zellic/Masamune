# Handle  p4st13r4   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The amount of the withdrawal request is not correctly updated after a withdrawal in `CDSTemplate.sol`. This happens because the withdrawal request is read from storage and put in memory, like this:  ```jsx Withdrawal memory request = withdrawalReq[msg.sender]; ```  However, the requested amount is not updated properly since the `withdrawalReq` in the storage is never updated. Instead, its in-memory version is updated, but it’s useless because that object is never used again:  ```jsx //reduce requested amount request.amount -= _amount; ```  This issue is non critical because there is a function that takes care of updating the withdrawal requests’ amount on every token transfer: [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/CDSTemplate.sol#L358](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/CDSTemplate.sol#L358)  The issue lies in the fact that the code seems to behave differently from how it looks at a first glance. Furthermore, the other two templates correctly update the value of the withdrawal request, so the version in `CDSTemplate.sol` should be aligned as well:  - [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L239](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L239) - [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L327](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L327)  ## Proof of Concept  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/CDSTemplate.sol#L230](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/CDSTemplate.sol#L230)  ## Tools Used  Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update the `amount` of the current withdrawal request as well
