# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  LaunchEvent has an explicit `initialized` variable which is in storage. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/a1579f6453bc4bf9fb0db9c627beaa41135438ed/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L228  To save an SSTORE we could just check that `_auctionStart > 0` as this is a sufficient check for initialisation. If a getter is needed then a function like the below could be added.  ``` function initialized() external view returns bool {   return auctionStart > 0; } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  As above.
