# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There is currently no input validation done on the `Router.initialize()` and `NoteERC20.initialize()` functions, potentially leading to an initialized state where the contracts have no owner and the deployer needs to re-deploy the contract to have it working properly.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/Router.sol#L63-L92 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/governance/NoteERC20.sol#L90-L108  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Perform zero address checks for the `owner_`, `pauseRouter_` and `pauseGuardian_` inputs to ensure the contract isn't initialized into an unexpected state.
