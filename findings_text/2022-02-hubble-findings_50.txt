These contracts allow users to earn profits based on the price of a base asset against a quote asset.  It is possible to add the same `AMM` twice in the function `whitelistAmm()`. The impact is that unrealized profits will be counted multiple times. As a result the liquidation calculations will be incorrect, potentially allowing users to trade while insolvent or incorrectly liquidating solvent users.  Note `whitelistAmm()` may only be called by Governance.  ## Proof of Concept  The function `getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl()` will iterate over all `amms` summing the `unrealizedPnl`  and `notinoalPosition`, thus if an `amm` is repeated the `unrealizedPnl` and `notionalPosition` of that asset will be counted multiple times.  This is used in `_calcMarginFraction()` which calculates a users margin as a fraction of the total position. The margin fraction is used to determine if a user is liquitable or is allowed to open new positions.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider ensuring the `AMM` does not already exist in the list when adding a new `AMM`.  ```     function whitelistAmm(address _amm) external onlyGovernance {         for (uint256 i; i < amm.length; i++) {             require(amm[i] != IAMM(_amm), "AMM already whitelisted");         }         emit MarketAdded(amms.length, _amm);         amms.push(IAMM(_amm));     } ```
