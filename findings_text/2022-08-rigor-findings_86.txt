The first call to `checkSignatureValidity` will already delete `approvedHashes[address(Bob)][_hash]`, the second call therefore fails.  Note that the same situation would also be possible for builder == contractor, or builder == subcontractor, although those situations are probably less likely to occur.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Delete the approval only when all checks are done.
