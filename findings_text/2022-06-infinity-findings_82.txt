This causes a loss of funds for the buyers whose orders came last in the batch.  ## Proof of Concept The issue is that the `startGasPerOrder` variable is computed within the for-loop. That causes the first iterations to be lower than later ones.  Here's an example for the following line: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/main/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L202 To make the math easy we use the following values: ``` startGas = 1,000,000 gasPerOrder = 100,000 (so fulfilling an order costs us 100,000 gas) ordersLength = 10 ```  For the 2nd order we then get: ``` startGasPerOrder = 900,000 + ((1,000,000 + 20,000 - 900,000) / 10) startGasPerOrder = 912,000 ``` For the 9th order we get: ``` startGasPerOrder = 200,000 + ((1,000,000 + 20,000 - 200,000) / 10) startGasPerOrder = 282,000 ```  The `startGasPerOrder` variable is passed through a couple of functions without any modification until it reaches a line like this: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/main/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L231  ```sol uint256 gasCost = (startGasPerOrder - gasleft() + wethTransferGasUnits) * tx.gasprice; ```  There, the actual gas costs for the user are computed.  In our case, that would be:  ``` # 2nd order # gasleft() is 800,00 because we said that executing the order costs ~100,000 gas. At the beginning of the order, it was 900,000 so now it's 800,000. This makes the computation a little more straightforward although it's not 100% correct. gasCost = (912,000 - 800,000 + 50,000) * 1 gasCost = 162,000  # 9th order gasCost = (282,000 - 100,000 + 50,000) * 1 gasCost = 232,000 ```  So the 2nd order's buyer pays `162,000` while the 9th order's buyer pays `232,000`.  As I said the math was dumbed down a bit to make it easier. The actual difference might not be as big as shown here. But, there is a difference.  ## Tools Used none  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `startGasPerOrder` variable should be initialized *outside* the for-loop.
