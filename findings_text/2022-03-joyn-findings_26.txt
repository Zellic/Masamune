# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreFactory.sol#L70-L77   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  This is dangerous in scam senario because the malicious user can frontrun and become the owner of the collection. As owner, one can withdraw `paymentToken`. (note that _collections.isForSale can be change by frontrunner)  ## Proof of Concept  1. Anyone can call `createProject`.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreFactory.sol#L70-L77  ```solidity   function createProject(     string memory _projectId,     Collection[] memory _collections   ) external onlyAvailableProject(_projectId) {     require(       _collections.length > 0,       'CoreFactory: should have more at least one collection'     ); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Two way to mitigate.  1. Consider use white list on project creation. 2. Ask user to sign their address and check the signature against `msg.sender`.  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L102
