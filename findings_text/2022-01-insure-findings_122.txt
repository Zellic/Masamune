# Handle  Fitraldys   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact in line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L508 instead of save `Insurance` value to memory then save to `insurences` storage it's better to save the `Insurence` value directly to `insurences`  storage or mapping to save gas.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L508 ``` contract insur {      struct Insurance {         uint256 id; //each insuance has their own id         uint256 startTime; //timestamp of starttime         uint256 endTime; //timestamp of endtime         uint256 amount; //insured amount         bytes32 target; //target id in bytes32         address insured; //the address holds the right to get insured         bool status; //true if insurance is not expired or redeemed     }       mapping(uint256 => Insurance) public insurances;      function coba() public {          uint256 _id = 10;         uint256 _endTime = 10;         uint256 _amount = 12;         bytes32 _target = bytes32(uint256(10));           Insurance memory _insurance = Insurance(             _id,             block.timestamp,             _endTime,             _amount,             _target,             msg.sender,             true         );         insurances[_id] = _insurance;      } } //154623 gas ```  change to : ``` contract insur {      struct Insurance {         uint256 id; //each insuance has their own id         uint256 startTime; //timestamp of starttime         uint256 endTime; //timestamp of endtime         uint256 amount; //insured amount         bytes32 target; //target id in bytes32         address insured; //the address holds the right to get insured         bool status; //true if insurance is not expired or redeemed     }       mapping(uint256 => Insurance) public insurances;      function coba() public {          uint256 _id = 10;         uint256 _endTime = 10;         uint256 _amount = 12;         bytes32 _target = bytes32(uint256(10));           insurances[_id] = Insurance(             _id,             block.timestamp,             _endTime,             _amount,             _target,             msg.sender,             true         );               } } //154610 gas  ```  ## Tools Used remix
