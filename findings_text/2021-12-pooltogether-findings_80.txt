# Handle  certora   # Vulnerability details  getRewardsAmount gets epochs ids as uint256[]. However, it should be uint8[].  In _calculateRewardAmount, the epoch start time and end time are calculated: ``` uint256 _epochStartTimestamp = _promotion.startTimestamp + (_epochDuration * _epochId); uint256 _epochEndTimestamp = _epochStartTimestamp + _epochDuration; ```  and then are casted to uint64 for the rest of the function. if it's greater than 2**64, it will be truncated. ## Impact `getRewardsAmount` might return wrong result  ## Tools Used manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps get _epochIds as uint8[] instead uint256[]
