# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Having both modifiers 'onlyAdmin' and 'onlySwivel' is not only more expensive but also misleading as these modifiers basically do the same job of checking an address against msg.sender.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Better have a generalized modifier, something like onlyAddress(address a), and re-use it with both admin and swivel:   modifier onlyAddress(address a) {     require(msg.sender == a, 'sender not authorized');     _;   }   onlyAddress(admin)   onlyAddress(swivel)
