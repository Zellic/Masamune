They are able to transfer the ERC777 to another account, at which time the before and after balance calculation will be incorrect.  ```         uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(receiver);           if (msg.sender != owner) {             _spendAllowance(owner, msg.sender, shares);         }         _redeemInternal(shares, receiver, owner); ///////////// Control is transferred to user. They can alter their balance here. ///////////          uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(receiver);         uint256 assets = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;  ////////// Assets can be as low as 0 if they have transferred the same amount out as received. //////////          emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);         return assets; ```  ## Tools Used Manual review
