# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Duplicated code, loss of maintainability, increased contract size which leads to increased gas cost  ## Proof of Concept The following can be simplified: ``` 260:         if (_available >= _amount) { 261:             _compensated = _amount; 262:             _attributionLoss = vault.transferValue(_amount, msg.sender); 263:             emit Compensated(msg.sender, _amount); 264:         } else { 265:             //when CDS cannot afford, pay as much as possible 266:             _compensated = _available; 267:             _attributionLoss = vault.transferValue(_available, msg.sender); 268:             emit Compensated(msg.sender, _available); 269:         } ``` to ``` 260:         _compensated = _available >= _amount ? _amount : _available; //when CDS cannot afford, pay as much as possible 261:         _attributionLoss = vault.transferValue(_compensated, msg.sender); 262:         emit Compensated(msg.sender, _compensated); ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Apply the refacto and look out for duplicated code
