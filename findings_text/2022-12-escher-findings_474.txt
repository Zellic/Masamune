# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-escher/blob/5d8be6aa0e8634fdb2f328b99076b0d05fefab73/src/minters/LPDA.sol#L58-L89   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `buy` function on the `LPDA.sol` contract is not validating if the auction is still running, allowing a purchase to be made after the stipulated time. The `endtime` variable used to store the end date of the auction is not used at any point to validate whether the purchase is being made within the deadline.  ## Proof of Concept  ``` // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT   pragma solidity ^0.8.17;   import "forge-std/Test.sol";  import {EscherTest} from "./utils/EscherTest.sol";  import {LPDAFactory, LPDA} from "src/minters/LPDAFactory.sol";   contract LPDABase is EscherTest {   LPDAFactory public lpdaSales;   LPDA.Sale public lpdaSale;     function setUp() public virtual override {    super.setUp();    lpdaSales = new LPDAFactory();   // set up a LPDA Sale    lpdaSale = LPDA.Sale({     currentId: uint48(0),     finalId: uint48(10),     edition: address(edition),     startPrice: uint80(uint256(1 ether)),     finalPrice: uint80(uint256(0.1 ether)),     dropPerSecond: uint80(uint256(0.1 ether) / 1 days),     startTime: uint96(block.timestamp),     saleReceiver: payable(address(69)),     endTime: uint96(block.timestamp + 1 days)    });  }  }   contract LPDATest is LPDABase {   LPDA public sale;     event End(LPDA.Sale _saleInfo);   function test_Buy() public {    sale = LPDA(lpdaSales.createLPDASale(lpdaSale));    // authorize the lpda sale to mint tokens   edition.grantRole(edition.MINTER_ROLE(), address(sale));   vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days);    sale.buy{value: 1 ether}(1);    assertEq(address(sale).balance, 1 ether);   }  } ```  The code above shows that even after two days after the `endTime` it was still possible to make the purchase.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Our recommendation would be to introduce a require to validate the  if the purchase is being made within the `endTime`.   ``` require(block.timestamp > sale.endTime, "TOO LATE"); ```  The above could must be placed at the beginning of the `buy` function.
