In order to avoid storage conflicts  EIP1967 was proposed.(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967)   The idea is to set proxy variables at fixed positions (like  `impl` and `admin` ).    For example, according to the standard,  the slot for for logic address should be  `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc` (obtained as `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.implementation')) - 1)`  ).  In this case, for example, as you inherits from `Ownable` the variable _owner is at the first slot and can be overwritten in the implementation.   There is a table at OZ site that explains this scenario more in detail  https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies  section  "Unstructured Storaged Proxies"  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using EIP1967
