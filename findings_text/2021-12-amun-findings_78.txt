# Handle  harleythedog   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `CallFacet.sol` contract has the function `_call` : ``` function  _call(  address  _target,  bytes  memory  _calldata,  uint256  _value ) internal {  require(address(this).balance >= _value, "ETH_BALANCE_TOO_LOW");  (bool success, ) = _target.call{value: _value}(_calldata);  require(success, "CALL_FAILED");  emit  Call(msg.sender, _target, _calldata, _value); } ``` This function is utilized in a lot of different places. According to the [Solidity docs]([https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)), "The low-level functions `call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return `true` as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".      As a result, it is possible that this call will not work but `_call` will not notice anything went wrong. It could be possible that a user is interacting with an exchange or token that has been deleted, but `_call` will not notice that something has gone wrong and as a result, ether can become stuck in the contract. For this reason, it would be better to also check for the contract's existence prior to executing `_target.call`.   For reference, see a similar high severity reported in a Uniswap audit here (report # 9): https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf    ## Proof of Concept See `_call` here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/98f6e2ff91f5fcebc0489f5871183566feaec307/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Call/CallFacet.sol#L108.  ## Tools Used Inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps To ensure tokens don't get stuck in edge case where user is interacting with a deleted contract, make sure to check that contract actually exists before calling it.
