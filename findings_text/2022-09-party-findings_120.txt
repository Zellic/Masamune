However, this introduces a reentrancy vulnerability which allows a party to get the tokens of another party. The problem is the `tokensToSend` hook which is executed BEFORE balance updates happens (see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777). When this hook is executed, `token.balanceOf(address(this))` therefore still returns the old value, but `_storedBalances[balanceID]` was already decreased.  ## Proof Of Concept Party A and Party B have a balance of 1,000,000 tokens (of some arbitrary ERC777 token) in the distributor. Let's say for the sake of simplicity that both parties only have one user (user A in party A, user B in party B). User A (or rather his smart contract) performs the following attack: - He calls `claim`, which transfers 1,000,000 tokens to his contract address. In `_transfer`, `_storedBalances[balanceId]` is decreased by 1,000,000 and therefore now has a value of 1,000,000. - In the `tokensToSend` hook, he initiates another distribution for his party A by calling `PartyGovernance.distribute` which calls `TokenDistributor.createERC20Distribution` (we assume for the sake of simplicity that the party does not have more of these tokens, so the call transfers 0 tokens to the distributor). `TokenDistributor.createERC20Distribution` passes `token.balanceOf(address(this))` to `_createDistribution`. Note that this is still 2,000,000 because we are in the `tokensToSend` hook. - The supply of this distribution is calculated as `(args.currentTokenBalance - _storedBalances[balanceId]) = 2,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000`. - When the `tokensToSend` hook is exited (and the first transfer has finished), he can retrieve the tokens of the second distribution (that was created in the hook) to steal the 1,000,000 tokens of party B.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Do not allow reentrancy in these functions.
