# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UniswapHandler.maltMarketPrice` function returns a tuple of the `price` and the `decimals` of the price. However, the returned `decimals` do not match the computed `price` for the `else if (rewardDecimals < maltDecimals)` branch:  ```solidity else if (rewardDecimals < maltDecimals) {   uint256 diff = maltDecimals - rewardDecimals;   price = (rewardReserves.mul(10**diff)).mul(10**rewardDecimals).div(maltReserves);   decimals = maltDecimals; } ```  Note that `rewardReserves` are in reward token decimals, `maltReserves` is a malt balance amount (18 decimals). Then, the returned amount is in `rewardDecimals + diffDecimals + rewardDecimals - maltDecimals = maltDecimals + rewardDecimals - maltDecimals = rewardDecimals`. However `decimals = maltDecimals` is wrongly returned.  ## Impact Callers to this function will receive a price in unexpected decimals and might inflate or deflate the actual amount. Luckily, the `AuctionEscapeHatch` decides to completely ignore the returned `decimals` and as all prices are effectively in `rewardDecimals`, even if stated in `maltDecimals`, it currently does not seem to lead to an issue.  ## Recommendation Fix the function by returning `rewardDecimals` instead of `maltDecimals` in the `rewardDecimals < maltDecimals` branch.
