# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L127   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact User can forfeit other user rewards by giving a higher _startIndex in getReward function  ## Proof of Concept 1. Assume User B has not received any reward yet so that his userClaims[_token][User B]=0 2. User A calls getReward function with _account as User B and _startIndex as 5 3. This eventually calls _allClaimableRewards at ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L213 which computes epochIndex =5>0?5:0 = 5 4. Assuming tokenEpochs is 10 and latestEpoch is 8, so reward will computed from epoch 5 till epoch index 7 and _allClaimableRewards will return index as 7 5. _getReward will simply update userClaims[_token][User B] with 7  6. This is incorrect because as per contract User B has received reward from epoch 0-7 even though he only received reward for epoch 5-7   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Do not allow users to call getReward function for other users
