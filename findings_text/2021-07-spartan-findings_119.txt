# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Incorrect event parameter outputAmount is used (instead of output) in the MintSynth event emit. outputAmount is a named return variable that is never set in this function and so will always be 0. This should instead be output. This will confuse the UI or offchain monitoring tools that 0 synths were minted and will lead to users panicking/complaining or trying to mint synth again.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L240  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L229  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L232  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace outputAmount with output in the emit.
