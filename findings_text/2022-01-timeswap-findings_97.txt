# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Similarly, the system will fail with low-level message without giving a business reason, which can be an issue for troubleshooting and further programmatic usages by other projects.   ## Proof of Concept  The owner variable is used by TimeswapPair.pay without validation:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L357  Which will yield low-level fail on array access if an owner is zero or not present in the system:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L360   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Verify owner function argument to be non-zero by expanding existing check:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L352  Then, require in line 358 that, for example, dues.length >= ids.length:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L358
