Otherwise, it will be possible to increase savedTokens[_token], and thus new user claim amounts will increase after some users might already have withdrawn their shares.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Based on my understanding, it should contain this check: ```solidity   require(activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD > block.timestamp, "too late"); ```
