# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas costs  ## Proof of Concept  It seems that we always want to get a pool's `allocatedCredit` and `availableBalance` together, suggesting that these values are tightly coupled.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L284-L287  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L356-L360  If we're regularly going to be requesting these values together it may be worth considering having a single function in the pool template which returns both of these values. This would save gas costs of performing an extra external call to the pool contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider having a function which returns both of these values to avoid repeated calls into the same contract for related info.
