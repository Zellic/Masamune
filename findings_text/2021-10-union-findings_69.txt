# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UnionToken` can check for a whitelist on each transfer in `_beforeTokenTransfer`:  ```solidity if (whitelistEnabled) {     require(isWhitelisted(msg.sender) || to == address(0), "Whitelistable: address not whitelisted"); } ```  This whitelist is checked on `msg.sender` not on `from`, the token owner.  ## Impact A single whitelisted account can act as an operator (everyone calls `unionToken.allow(operator, max)` where the operator is a whitelisted trusted smart contract) for all other accounts. This essentially bypasses the whitelist.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Think about if the whitelist on `msg.sender` is correct or if it should be on `from`.
