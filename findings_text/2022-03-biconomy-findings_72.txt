While this affects the enforcement of the cap limits and the `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` function, the worst impact this has is that the address cannot have liquidity removed / transferred due to subtraction overflow.  In particular, users can be prevented from withdrawing their staked LP tokens from the liquidity farming contract should it become non-excluded.  ## Proof of Concept  - Assume liquidity farming address `0xA` is excluded - Bob stakes his LP token - Liquidity farming contract is no longer to be excluded: `setIsExcludedAddressStatus([0xA, false])` - Bob attempts to withdraw liquidity → reverts because `totalLiquidityByLp[USDC][0xA] = 0`, resulting in subtraction overflow.  ```jsx // insert test case in Withdraw test block of LiquidityFarming.tests.ts it.only('will brick withdrawals by no longer excluding farming contract', async () => {   await farmingContract.deposit(1, bob.address);   await wlpm.setIsExcludedAddressStatus([farmingContract.address], [false]);   await farmingContract.connect(bob).withdraw(1, bob.address); });  // results in // Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block) ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The simplest way is to prevent exclusion removals.  ```jsx function setIsExcludedAddresses(address[] memory _addresses) external onlyOwner {   for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {     isExcludedAddress[_addresses[i]] = true;     // emit event     emit AddressExcluded(_addresses[i]);   } } ```
