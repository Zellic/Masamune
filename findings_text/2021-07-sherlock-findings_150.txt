# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `_accrueSherX` function of `LibSherX` and the `payOffDebtAll` function of `LibPool` can be called multiple times in the same block (from different users and transactions). If the current block number is the same as the last-recorded one, it is possible to save gas by early returning at the beginning of the functions.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [LibSherX.sol#L123-L141](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibSherX.sol#L123-L141) [LibPool.sol#L84-L95](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibPool.sol#L84-L95)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  For example, consider re-writing `_accrueSherX` as follows:  ```solidity function _accrueSherX(IERC20 _token, uint256 sherXPerBlock) private returns (uint256 sherX) {   PoolStorage.Base storage ps = PoolStorage.ps(_token);   if (block.number == ps.sherXLastAccrued) {     return 0;   }   sherX = block.number.sub(ps.sherXLastAccrued).mul(sherXPerBlock).mul(ps.sherXWeight).div(     uint16(-1)   );   // need to settle before return, as updating the sherxperlblock/weight   // after it was 0 will result in a too big amount (accured will be < block.number)   ps.sherXLastAccrued = uint40(block.number);   if (address(_token) == address(this)) {     ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.add(sherX);   } else {     ps.unallocatedSherX = ps.unallocatedSherX.add(sherX);     ps.sWeight = ps.sWeight.add(sherX);   } } ```
