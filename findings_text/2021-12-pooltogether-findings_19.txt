# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function _requirePromotionActive() contains the following check in a require statement: ```JS  _promotionEndTimestamp > 0 && _promotionEndTimestamp >= block.timestamp, ``` When _promotionEndTimestamp is larger than block.timestamp it will also be larger than 0. Thus the statement can be simplified to save some gas.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L250-L258  ```JS function _requirePromotionActive(Promotion memory _promotion) internal view {         ...         require(  _promotionEndTimestamp > 0 && _promotionEndTimestamp >= block.timestamp, "TwabRewards/promotion-not-active" );     } ```   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the require statement to:         require( _promotionEndTimestamp >= block.timestamp, "TwabRewards/promotion-not-active" ); // will certainly be > 0
