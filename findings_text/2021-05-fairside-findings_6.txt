# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the function purchaseMembership of FSDNetwork.sol, when the membership is extended then membership[msg.sender].creation is increased, however  membership[msg.sender].gracePeriod is not increased. This might lead to a gracePeriod than is less then expected. It seems logical to also increase the gracePeriod    ## Proof of Concept FSDNetwork.sol // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside/blob/main/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L171 function purchaseMembership(uint256 costShareBenefit) external {      ...       if (membership[msg.sender].creation == 0) {             ...             membership[msg.sender].creation       = block.timestamp;             membership[msg.sender].gracePeriod =  membership[msg.sender].creation +  MEMBERSHIP_DURATION +  60 days;         } else {           ....           membership[msg.sender].creation += durationIncrease;    }  ## Tools Used Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check if gracePeriod has to be increased also.  When that is the case add the logic to do that.
