# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Code clarity or possibly gas savings if all the other named returns are in error.  ## Proof of Concept  Function `poolDelegate` does not have a named return even though its interface definition does. The named return isn't used so the fact that it's missing doesn't matter.  Function `pool` and tens of other functions do have a named return. Most of these named returns are not used and could be deleted. I'm assuming this is a project convention and may be used in off-chain reporting, etc.  https://github.com/maple-labs/debt-locker/blob/81f55907db7b23d27e839b9f9f73282184ed4744/contracts/DebtLocker.sol#L279-L285  ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a named return to function `poolDelegate' for consistency/reporting.  Or if all those other named returns are in error, remove the unused named returns and kick this ticket over to gas optimization.
