# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact contract OverlayV1OVLCollateral and OverlayV1Governance cache ovl address: ```solidity  IOverlayTokenNew immutable public ovl; ``` This variable is initialized in the constructor and fetched from the mothership contract: ```solidity   mothership = IOverlayV1Mothership(_mothership);   ovl = IOverlayV1Mothership(_mothership).ovl(); ``` ovl is declared as immutable and later contract interacts with this cached version. However, mothership contains a setter function, so the governor can point it to a new address: ```solidity function setOVL (address _ovl) external onlyGovernor {     ovl = _ovl; } ```  OverlayV1OVLCollateral and OverlayV1Governance will still use this old cached value.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider if this was intended, or you want to remove this cached version and always fetch on the go (this will increase the gas costs though).
