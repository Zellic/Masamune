The function `isBLSPublicKeyPartOfLSDNetwork` only checks if the public key is part of the LSD network: ```solidity function isBLSPublicKeyPartOfLSDNetwork(bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot) public virtual view returns (bool) {         return smartWalletOfKnot[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot] != address(0); } ``` The function `isBLSPublicKeyBanned` would perform both checks and should be called here: ```solidity function isBLSPublicKeyBanned(bytes calldata _blsPublicKeyOfKnot) public virtual view returns (bool) {         return !isBLSPublicKeyPartOfLSDNetwork(_blsPublicKeyOfKnot) || bannedBLSPublicKeys[_blsPublicKeyOfKnot] != address(0); } ```  Because of that, it is possible to pass banned BLS public keys to `registerBLSPublicKeys` and the call will succeed.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use `isBLSPublicKeyBanned` instead of `isBLSPublicKeyPartOfLSDNetwork`.
