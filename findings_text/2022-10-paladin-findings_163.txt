Based on a target, the number of missing votes is calculated, which is then used to calculated the total reward amount ([WardenPledge.sol#L325-L327](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L325-L327)): ```solidity function createPledge(     address receiver,     address rewardToken,     uint256 targetVotes,     uint256 rewardPerVote, // reward/veToken/second     uint256 endTimestamp,     uint256 maxTotalRewardAmount,     uint256 maxFeeAmount ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns(uint256){     ...     // Get the missing votes for the given receiver to reach the target votes     // We ignore any delegated boost here because they might expire during the Pledge duration     // (we can have a future version of this contract using adjusted_balance)     vars.votesDifference = targetVotes - votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver);      vars.totalRewardAmount = (rewardPerVote * vars.votesDifference * vars.duration) / UNIT;     ...   } ```  When extending a pledge or increasing a pledge reward per vote, current veToken balance of the pledge's receiver (`votingEscrow.balanceOf(receiver)`) can be different from the one it had when the pledge was created (e.g. the receiver managed to lock more CRV or some of locked tokens have expired). However `pledgeParams.votesDifference` is not recalculated ([WardenPledge.sol#L387](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L387), [WardenPledge.sol#L432](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-paladin/blob/d6d0c0e57ad80f15e9691086c9c7270d4ccfe0e6/contracts/WardenPledge.sol#L432)): ```solidity function extendPledge(     uint256 pledgeId,     uint256 newEndTimestamp,     uint256 maxTotalRewardAmount,     uint256 maxFeeAmount ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {     ...     Pledge storage pledgeParams = pledges[pledgeId];     ...     uint256 totalRewardAmount = (pledgeParams.rewardPerVote * pledgeParams.votesDifference * addedDuration) / UNIT;     ... }  function increasePledgeRewardPerVote(     uint256 pledgeId,     uint256 newRewardPerVote,     uint256 maxTotalRewardAmount,     uint256 maxFeeAmount ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {     ...     Pledge storage pledgeParams = pledges[pledgeId];     ...     uint256 totalRewardAmount = (rewardPerVoteDiff * pledgeParams.votesDifference * remainingDuration) / UNIT;     ... } ```  This can lead to two consequences: 1. When receiver's veToken balance has increased (i.e. `votesDifference` got in fact smaller), pledge creator will overpay for pledge extension and pledge reward per vote increase. This extra reward cannot be received by pledgers because a receiver cannot get more votes than `pledgeParams.targetVotes` (which is not updated when modifying a pledge):     ```solidity     function _pledge(uint256 pledgeId, address user, uint256 amount, uint256 endTimestamp) internal {         ...         // Check that this will not go over the Pledge target of votes         if(delegationBoost.adjusted_balance_of(pledgeParams.receiver) + amount > pledgeParams.targetVotes) revert Errors.TargetVotesOverflow();         ...     }     ``` 1. When receiver's veToken balance has decreased (i.e. `votesDifference` got in fact bigger), the pledge target cannot be reached because the reward amount was underpaid in `extendPledge`/`increasePledgeRewardPerVote`.  ## Tools Used Manual review ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider updating `votesDifference` when extending a pledge or increasing a pledge reward per vote.
