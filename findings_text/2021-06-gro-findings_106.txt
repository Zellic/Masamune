# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The Chainlink API (`latestAnswer`) used in the `Buoy3Pool` oracle wrappers is deprecated:  > This API is deprecated. Please see API Reference for the latest Price Feed API. [Chainlink Docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/deprecated-aggregatorinterface-api-reference/#latestanswer)  ## Impact It seems like the old API can return stale data. Checks similar to that of the new API using `latestTimestamp` and `latestRoundare` are needed. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation: * [under current notifications: "if answeredInRound < roundId could indicate stale data."](https://docs.chain.link/docs/developer-communications#current-notifications) * [under historical price data: "A timestamp with zero value means the round is not complete and should not be used."](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data#solidity)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add the recommended checks: ```solidity (     uint80 roundID,     int256 price,     ,     uint256 timeStamp,     uint80 answeredInRound ) = chainlink.latestRoundData(); require(     timeStamp != 0,     “ChainlinkOracle::getLatestAnswer: round is not complete” ); require(     answeredInRound >= roundID,     “ChainlinkOracle::getLatestAnswer: stale data” ); require(price != 0, "Chainlink Malfunction”); ```
