# Handle  kirk-baird   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  This is a reentrancy vulnerability that would allow the attacker to drain the entire SHER balance of the contract.  Note: this attack requires gaining control of execution `sher.transfer()` which will depend on the implementation of the SHER token. Control may be gained by the attacker if the contract implements ERC777 or otherwise makes external calls during `transfer()`.  ## Proof of Concept  See [_sendSherRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/Sherlock.sol#L442)  ```solidity   function _sendSherRewardsToOwner(uint256 _id, address _nftOwner) internal {     uint256 sherReward = sherRewards_[_id];     if (sherReward == 0) return;      // Transfers the SHER tokens associated with this NFT ID to the address of the NFT owner     sher.safeTransfer(_nftOwner, sherReward);     // Deletes the SHER reward mapping for this NFT ID     delete sherRewards_[_id];   } ```  Here `sherRewards` are deleted after the potential external call is made in `sher.safeTransfer()`. As a result if an attacker reenters this function `sherRewards_` they will still maintain the original balance of rewards and again transfer the SHER tokens.  As `_sendSherRewardsToOwner()` is `internal` the attack can be initiated through the `external` function `ownerRestake()` [see here.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/Sherlock.sol#L595)  Steps to produce the attack:  1) Deploy attack contract to handle reenterancy 2) Call `initialStake()` from the attack contract with the smallest `period` 3) Wait for `period` amount of time to pass 4) Have the attack contract call `ownerRestake()`. The attack contract will gain control of the (See note above about control flow). This will recursively call `ownerRestake()` until the balance of `Sherlock` is 0 or less than the user's reward amount. Then allow reentrancy loop to unwind and complete.  ## Tools Used  n/a  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Reentrancy can be mitigated by one of two solutions.  The first option is to add a reentrancy guard like `nonReentrant` the is used in `SherlockClaimManager.sol`.  The second option is to use the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This would involve doing all validation checks and state changes before making any potential external calls. For example the above function could be modified as follows.  ```solidity   function _sendSherRewardsToOwner(uint256 _id, address _nftOwner) internal {     uint256 sherReward = sherRewards_[_id];     if (sherReward == 0) return;      // Deletes the SHER reward mapping for this NFT ID     delete sherRewards_[_id];      // Transfers the SHER tokens associated with this NFT ID to the address of the NFT owner     sher.safeTransfer(_nftOwner, sherReward);   } ```  Additionally the following functions are not exploitable however should be updated to use the check-effects-interations pattern. - `Sherlock._redeemShares()` should do `_transferTokensOut()` last. - `Sherlock.initialStake()` should do `token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);` last - `SherClaim.add()` should do `sher.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);` after updating `userClaims`  - `SherlockProtocolManager.depositToActiveBalance()` should do `token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);` after updating `activeBalances`
