# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `BeaconProxyDeployer.deploy()` function is used to deploy lightweight proxy contracts that act as each asset's vault. The function does not revert properly if there is a failed contract deployment or revert from the `create2` opcode as it does not properly check the returned address for bytecode. The `create2` opcode returns the expected address which will never be the zero address (as is what is currently checked).  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-library/contracts/BeaconProxyDeployer.sol#L31  ## Tools Used  Manual code review Discussions with the Mochi team Discussions with library dev  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The recommended mitigation was to update `iszero(result)` to `iszero(extcodesize(result))` in the line mentioned above. This change has already been made in the corresponding library which can be found [here](https://github.com/Nipol/bean-contracts/pull/13), however, this needs to also be reflected in Mochi's contracts.
