# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact This issue has no direct security implications, however, there may be some confusion when understanding what the `RCFactory.createMarket()` function actually does.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L625  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update the line (linked above) to include the `SAFE_MODE` option outline in the `enum` type in `IRCMarket.sol`. For example, the line `/// @param _mode 0 = normal, 1 = winner takes all` could be updated to `/// @param _mode 0 = normal, 1 = winner takes all, 2 = SAFE_MODE`
