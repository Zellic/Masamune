# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact If a caller has privileges for a QuickAccount consisting of two `address(0)`'s, then the caller can execute arbitrary transactions through the  `QuicAccManager::send()` function.  ## Proof of Concept A caller of the `QuickAccManager::send()` needs to be privileged for the  QuickAccount the caller provides as argument ([line 57](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/main/contracts/wallet/QuickAccManager.sol#L57)).  As an arbitrary value can be set as `privileged[caller]` in `Indentity.sol`, so can a QuickAccount struct consisting of two `address(0)`'s.  The following calls to `SignatureValidator::recoverAddr()` (line 69, 70 and 73) can be made to always return `address(0)` if the signature has  `SignatureMode.NoSig`.  As the signature is provided as argument in `QuickAccManager::send()`, the  caller has total control of it.  The checks in line [69, 70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/main/contracts/wallet/QuickAccManager.sol#L69) and [73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/main/contracts/wallet/QuickAccManager.sol#L73) now always pass as long as the accounts in the QuickAccount struct are  `address(0)` too.  Therefore, a caller with permissions for such a QuickAccount can execute and  schedule arbitrary transactions without the need for valid signatures.  ## Tools Used -  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check in the `QuickAccManager::send()` function to forbid  QuickAccounts with `address(0)`.
