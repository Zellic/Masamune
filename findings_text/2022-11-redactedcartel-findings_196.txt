And transaction will fail   ## Proof of Concept Let's imagine USDT in arbitrub started to charge fees 1% per transfer  Alice wants to deposit 100 USDT through ``PirexGmx.depositGlp()`` Then you do  ``t.safeTransferFrom(Alice, address(this), 100);`` You will receive only 99 USDT  But in the next line you will try to send 100 USDT: ``` deposited = gmxRewardRouterV2.mintAndStakeGlp(                 token,                 tokenAmount,                 minUsdg,                 minGlp             ); ```  So transaction fails and Alice can't get pxGlp tokens    ## Tools Used  vs code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  USDT already has fees in other blockchains.  Many of these tokens use proxy pattern (and USDT too). It's quite probably that in one day one of the tokens will start charge fees. Or you would like to add one more token to whitelist and the token will be with fees  Thats why I consider finding as medium severity   To avoid problems, use common pattern, when you check your balance before operation and balance after, like that:  ```             uint256 balanceBefore = t.balanceOf(address(this));             t.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenAmount);             uint256 balanceAfter = t.balanceOf(address(this));              uint256 tokenAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;              // Mint and stake GLP using ERC20 tokens             deposited = gmxRewardRouterV2.mintAndStakeGlp(                 token,                 tokenAmount,                 minUsdg,                 minGlp             ); ```
