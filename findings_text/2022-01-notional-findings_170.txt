# Handle  SolidityScan   # Vulnerability details  ## Description The value of `totalSupply()` at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L260 does not check if the value of totalSupply is 0 or not and it is per   ## Impact The return value for the function `getPoolTokenShare` can be invalid because if there's an error in the `totalSupply()` the code at Line 260 will evaluate to divide by zero creating inconsistencies in the function logic.   ## Proof of Concept 1. Check the function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-notional/blob/main/contracts/sNOTE.sol#L257-L261 2. At line 260 we will notice that the value of totalSupply() is directly being used to perform division to the multiplication of `bptBalance * sNOTEAmount`   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a check if the value of `totalSupply()` is zero or not or some other edge cases that can cause inconsistencies.
