Once the option expires, the owner can change the fee back and wait for another buyer  ```solidity File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1  288           // increment vault beneficiary's ETH balance 289           ethBalance[getVaultBeneficiary(vaultId)] += msg.value - fee; ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L288-L289  ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add reasonable fee rate bounds checks in the `setFee()` function
