# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  In the unlikely event `amountReservedInCaseOfInsufficientAaveLiquidity == amount`, the `else` case will be executed, which means `lendingPool.deposit()` is called with a value of zero. It would therefore be better to change the condition so that the `if` case is executed instead.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx function depositPaymentToken(uint256 amount) external override longShortOnly {   // If amountReservedInCaseOfInsufficientAaveLiquidity isn't zero, then efficiently net the difference between the amount   // It basically always be zero besides extreme and unlikely situations with aave.   if (amountReservedInCaseOfInsufficientAaveLiquidity != 0) {   // instead of strictly greater than     if (amountReservedInCaseOfInsufficientAaveLiquidity >= amount) {       amountReservedInCaseOfInsufficientAaveLiquidity -= amount;       // Return early, nothing to deposit into the lending pool       return;     }  ... } ```
