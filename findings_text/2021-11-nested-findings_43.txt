# Handle  GiveMeTestEther   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The storage variable totalWeights can be set 0 by onlyOwner and therefore we would have a division by zero in the function "_computeShareCount" https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L268  ## Proof of Concept -Assumption we have one shareholder with weight S1 > 0 and royaltiesWeight > 0. -With the function updateShareholder the onlyOwner sets the S1 of our shareholder to 0.  - updateShareholder: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L166  - require(_totalWeights > 0, "FeeSplitter: TOTAL_WEIGHTS_ZERO") condition is met because _totalWeights is the sum of all shareholder weights + royaltiesWeight, and royaltiesWeight is > 0 - With the function setRoyaltiesWeight the onlyOwner sets the royaltiesWeight to 0.  - setRoyaltiesWeight: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L94 - => setRoyaltiesWeight is 0 and totalWeights is 0   ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps At the end of the function setRoyaltiesWeight check for 0 weight with a require: require(totalWeights > 0, "FeeSplitter: TOTAL_WEIGHTS_ZERO"); https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L94
