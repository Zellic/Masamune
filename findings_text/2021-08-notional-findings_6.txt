# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function _transfer of nTokenAction.sol uses temporary variables and updates the sender and recipient separately. This is a dangerous constructions because the update of the recipient could overwrite the update of the sender. This has led to several hacks at other comparable contracts  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol ```JS  function _transfer(uint256 currencyId,address sender,address recipient, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {        ...           senderBalance.netNTokenTransfer = amountInt.neg();         recipientBalance.netNTokenTransfer = amountInt;          senderBalance.finalize(sender, senderContext, false);         recipientBalance.finalize(recipient, recipientContext, false);         senderContext.setAccountContext(sender);         recipientContext.setAccountContext(recipient); ... ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Double check what happens when sender==recipient  Add checks to make sure (sender!=recipient) because that usually isn't useful anyway.
