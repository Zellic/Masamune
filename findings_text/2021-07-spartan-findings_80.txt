# Handle  natus   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  This function calls feeArray from storage when setting 'n' and then twice every loop (feeArray[i] && feeArray[i - 1]) and then again after the loop once.   If this was instead called once at the start and stored in memory; iterated and then assigned into the storage at the end; could save some gas   ## Proof of Concept UTILS lines #300 to #306  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L301    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Step1: Above line #301; add in: uint [] memory _feeArray = feeArray (Get the storage feeArray and store it in memory)  Step2: change feeArray.length to _feeArray.length  Step3: change: feeArray[i] = feeArray[i - 1] to: _feeArray[i] = _feeArray[i - 1]  Step4: change: feeArray[0] = _fee To: _feeArray[0] = _fee  Step5: add: feeArray = _feeArray  as the final line inside the function
