This means that anyone can call the cancelForETH function of the RubiconRouter contract to cancel the offer and get the ether. ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/8c312a63a91193c6a192a9aab44ff980fbfd7741/contracts/RubiconRouter.sol#L383-L409 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/8c312a63a91193c6a192a9aab44ff980fbfd7741/contracts/RubiconRouter.sol#L440-L452 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Set the owner of offer_id to msg.sender in offerWithETH function and check it in cancelForETH function
