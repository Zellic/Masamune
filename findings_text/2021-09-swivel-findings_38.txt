# Handle  itsmeSTYJ   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In `initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit()` , this comment `// transfer underlying tokens - the premium paid + fee in underlying to swivel (from sender)`  is incorrect because you are actually transferring the underlying tokens - premium paid to the maker (from sender) AND you have to pay fee separately to swivel.  initiateZCTokenFillingZcTokenExit means I want to sell my nTokens so that means `a` is the amount of principal I want to fill. Let's use a hypothetical example where I (taker) wants to fill 10 units of ZcTokenExit for maker.  1. I transfer 10 units of underlying to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a), swivel (+a) 2. I transfer fee (in underlying) to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a-fee), swivel (+a+fee)  3. Swivel initiates my position, sends me the ZcToken and sends Maker the nTokens 4. Maker pays me premiumFilled for the nTokens. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+a+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled) 5. Maker closes position. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled+a)  So effectively, I (taker) should be paying a-premium to maker and fee to swivel.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx function initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit(Hash.Order calldata o, uint256 a, Sig.Components calldata c) internal {     bytes32 hash = validOrderHash(o, c);      require(a <= o.principal - filled[hash]), 'taker amount > available volume'); // Note: you don't need to wrap these in brackets because if you look at the https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html#order-of-precedence-of-operators, subtraction will always go before comparison       filled[hash] += a;      uint256 premiumFilled = (((a * 1e18) / o.principal) * o.premium) / 1e18;     uint256 fee = ((premiumFilled * 1e18) / fenominator[0]) / 1e18;      // transfer underlying tokens - the premium paid in underlying to maker (from sender)     Erc20(o.underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a - premiumFilled);   Erc20(o.underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, swivel, fee);     // transfer <a> zcTokens between users in marketplace     require(MarketPlace(marketPlace).p2pZcTokenExchange(o.underlying, o.maturity, o.maker, msg.sender, a), 'zcToken exchange failed');                  emit Initiate(o.key, hash, o.maker, o.vault, o.exit, msg.sender, a, premiumFilled); } ```
