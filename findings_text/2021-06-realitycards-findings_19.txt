# Handle  heiho1   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  RCMarket#tokenURI(uint256) is declared external in the IRCMarket interface but is declared public in the RCMarket implementation.   This is inconsistent and affect the gas behavior of the function: https://gus-tavo-guim.medium.com/public-vs-external-functions-in-solidity-b46bcf0ba3ac  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/interfaces/IRCMarket.sol#L27  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L344  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L344  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Mark the implementation method as external.
