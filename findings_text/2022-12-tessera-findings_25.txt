It does not constrain on the `_collateral` supplied (except it will revert in _verifyBalance if set to 0). Anyone can block normal proposal creation by creating a proposal with lower price but _collateral == 1. When a high total supply is used, the price of each Rae is negligible and enable an attacker to DOS the protocol.  This violated the `prevent a user from holding a vault hostage and never letting the piece be reasonably bought` requirement.  ## Proof of Concept  For any proposal, an attacker can deny it with _collateral = 1 and _price = price - 1  If he do not want the NFT to be sold, he can reject the proposal himself, reseting the contract state.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol#L112-L116  ```solidity         // Reverts if price per token is not lower than both the proposed and active listings         if (             _pricePerToken >= proposedListing.pricePerToken ||             _pricePerToken >= activeListings[_vault].pricePerToken         ) revert NotLower(); ```  Add this test to OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol:  ```     function testProposeRevertLowerTotalValue() public {         uint256 _collateral = 100;         uint256 _price = 100;         // setup         testPropose(_collateral, _price);         lowerPrice = pricePerToken - 1;         // execute         vm.expectRevert();         _propose(eve, vault, 1, lowerPrice, offer);         // expect         _assertListing(eve, 1, lowerPrice, block.timestamp);         _assertTokenBalance(eve, token, tokenId, eveTokenBalance - 1);     } ``` [FAIL. Reason: Call did not revert as expected]   ## Tools Used  Foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Require the total value of the new collateral be greater than the previous. This however still allow a Rae holder with sufficiently large holding to block proposal by creating a new proposal and immediately reject it himself.
