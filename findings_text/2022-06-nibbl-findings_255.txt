# QA Report  ## [L-01] Lack of ownership transfer pattern Setting the curator to the wrong address will result in permanent loss of functionality in the protocol. It is recommended to apply a two-step transfer.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L485-L488  ## [L-02] Unnecessary safeTransferFrom() when sending from address(this) `safeTransfer()` can be used instead when sending from the current address.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L495-L509  ## [L-03] Missing zero address check Contract would need to be redeployed if the `feeTo` variable is accidently set to address(0).  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVaultFactory.sol#L25  ## [L-04] Unsafe transfer, use safeTransfer() It is recommended to use safeTransfer() instead of transfer() to mitigate against ERC20 implementations that do not revert on failure.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L517  ## [N-01] Constants should be all caps Most constants defined in the contracts are fully capitalized, just this one example is not.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L28  ## [N-02] CURVE_FEE is described as a variable when it is a constant https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl/blob/8c3dbd6adf350f35c58b31723d42117765644110/contracts/NibblVault.sol#L210
