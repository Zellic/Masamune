# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the IndexPool contract, pow is used in calculating price. [IndexPool.sol#L255-L266](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/IndexPool.sol#L255-L266) However, Pow is easy to cause overflow. If the `weightRatio` is large (e.g. 10), there's always overflow.  Lp providers can still provide liquidity to the pool where no one can swap. All pools need to redeploy. I consider this a high-risk issue.   ## Proof of concept  It's easy to trigger this bug by deploying a 1:10 IndexPool.  ```python     deployed_code = encode_abi(["address[]","uint136[]","uint256"], [         (link.address, dai.address),         (10**18, 10 * 10**18),         10**13     ])     tx_hash = master_deployer.functions.deployPool(index_pool_factory.address, deployed_code).transact() ```  Transactions would be reverted when buying `link` with `dai`. ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The `weightRatio` is an 18 decimals number. It should be divided by `(BASE)^exp`. The scale in the contract is not consistent. Recommend the dev to check all the scales/ decimals.
