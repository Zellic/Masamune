# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There's a feature of `virtualPrice` that is monotonically increasing regardless of the market. This function is heavily used in multiple protocols. e.g.(curve metapool, mim, ...) This is not held in the current implementation of customSwap since `customPrecisionMultipliers` can be changed by changing the target price.  There're two issues here: The meaning of `virtualPrice` would be vague. This may damage the lp providers as the protocol that adopts it may be hacked.  I consider this is a medium-risk issue.  ## Proof of Concept We can set up a mockSwap with extra `setPrecisionMultiplier` to check the issue. ```solidity     function setPrecisionMultiplier(uint256 multipliers) external {         swapStorage.tokenPrecisionMultipliers[0] = multipliers;      } ```  ```python     print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())     swap.functions.setPrecisionMultiplier(2).transact()     print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())  # output log: #   1000000000000000000 #   1499889859738721606 ``` ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Dealing with the target price with multiplier precision seems clever as we can reuse most of the existing code. However, the precision multiplier should be an immutable parameter. Changing it after the pool is set up would create multiple issues. This function could be implemented in a safer way IMHO.  The quick fix would be to remove the `getVirtualPrice` function. I can't come up with a safe way if other protocol wants to use this function.
