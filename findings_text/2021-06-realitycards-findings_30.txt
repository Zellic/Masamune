# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the function withdrawDeposit of RCTreasury.sol, the value of isForeclosed[_msgSender]  is set to true. In the next statement it is overwritten with a new value. So the first statement seem redundant. However this is not the case because it is retrieved from the function removeUserFromOrderbook (see proof of concept below)  As this is not obvious it is probably useful to add a comment so future developers can understand this.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L322 function withdrawDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _localWithdrawal)  external  override  balancedBooks  {   ...      isForeclosed[_msgSender] = true;   // this seems to be redundant     isForeclosed[_msgSender] = orderbook.removeUserFromOrderbook( _msgSender );  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCOrderbook.sol#L575   function removeUserFromOrderbook(address _user)  external override returns (bool _userForeclosed) {         require(treasury.isForeclosed(_user), "User must be foreclosed");   // this checks the isForeclosed value from the treasury contract   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a comment to  isForeclosed[_msgSender] = true;  explaining this line is important.
