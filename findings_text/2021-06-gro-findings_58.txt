# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Error strings used in require checks should accurately reflect the failing condition. Use of informative/accurate error messages helps troubleshoot exceptional conditions during transaction failures or unexpected behavior. Otherwise, it can be misleading and waste crucial time during exploits or emergency conditions.   While the codebase has this correct in most places, there are a few places where there appears to be a copy/paste error:  Example 1: require(msg.sender == withdrawHandler || msg.sender == insurance, "depositStable: !depositHandler");  The error string should indicate “!withdrawHandler/insurance” instead of “!depositHandler”  Example 2: require(msg.sender == _controller().insurance(), "withdraw: !withdrawHandler/insurance");  The error string should only indicate “!insurance” instead of “!withdrawHandler/insurance”  ## Proof of Concept  For reference, see Note 2 in OpenZeppelin's Audit of Compound Governor Bravo: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/vaults/BaseVaultAdaptor.sol#L206-L211  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/vaults/BaseVaultAdaptor.sol#L228  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L162  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/pools/LifeGuard3Pool.sol#L285  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/091660467fc8d13741f8aafcec80f1e8cf129a33/contracts/Controller.sol#L405   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check/fix error strings.
