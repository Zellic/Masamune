This is problematic because the value of the flashloan asset is constantly fluctuating in value against PAR. This results in an unpredictable fee for both the user and the manager. If the asset drops in price then the user will pay more than they intended. If the asset increases in price then the fee may not be enough to incentivize the manager to call them. The purpose of the managed rebalance is limit user interaction. If the manager isn't incentivized to call the vault then the user may be unexpectedly liquidated, resulting in loss of user funds.    ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  varFee should be calculated against the PAR of the rebalance like it is in MIMOAutoRebalance.sol:      IPriceFeed priceFeed = a.priceFeed();     address fromCollateral = vaultsData.vaultCollateralType(rbData.vaultId);      uint256 rebalanceValue = priceFeed.convertFrom(fromCollateral, flData.amount);     uint256 managerFee = managedVault.fixedFee + rebalanceValue.wadMul(managedVault.varFee);
