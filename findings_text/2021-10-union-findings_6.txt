# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function setHalfDecayPoint allows setting an arbitrary value of halfDecayPoint. However if halfDecayPoint == 0 then inflationPerBlock will have a division by 0.  Probably it is also useful to have an upper limit for halfDecayPoint.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L67-L69  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union/blob/4176c366986e6d1a6b3f6ec0079ba547b040ac0f/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L275-L278   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps In the function setHalfDecayPoint: Verify that the new value of halfDecayPoint is within an allowable range ( certainly != 0)
