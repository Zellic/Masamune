BathBuddy Vesting Wallet releases a user their relative share of the pool’s total vested bonus token during the withdraw call on BathToken.sol. This vesting occurs linearly over Unix time.  It was observed that an attacker could steal almost all the `bonusTokens` in the BathBuddy Vesting Wallet.  ## Proof-of-Concept  The root cause of this issue is that the amount of `bonusTokens` that a user is entitled to is based on their relative share of the pool’s total vested bonus token at the point of the withdraw call. It is calculated based on the user's "spot" share in the pool. Thus, it is possible for an attacker to deposit large amount of tokens into a BathToken Pool to gain significant share of the pool (e.g. 95%), and then withdraw the all the shares immediately. The withdraw call will trigger the `BathToken.distributeBonusTokenRewards`, and since attacker holds overwhelming amount of share in the pool, they will receive almost all the `bonusToken` in the BathBuddy Vesting wallet, leaving behind dust amount of `bonusToken` in the wallet. This could be perform in an atomic transaction and attacker can leverage on flash-loan to fund this attack.  The following shows an example of this issue:  1. A sponsor sent 1000 DAI to the BathBuddy Vesting Wallet to be used as `bonusTokens` for bathWETH pool. The vesting duration is 4 weeks. 2. Alice and Bob deposited 50 WETH and 50 WETH respectively. The total underlying asset of bathWETH is 100 WETH after depositing. Each of them hold 50% of the shares in the pool. 3. Fast forward to the last hour of the vesting period, most of the `bonusToken` have been vested and ready for the recipients to claim. In this example, estimate 998 DAI are ready to be claimed at the final hour. 4. Since Alice has 50% stake in the pool, she should have accured close to 449 DAI at this point. If she decided to withdraw all her bathWETH LP tokens at this point, she would receive close to 449 DAI as `bonusTokens`. But she choose not to withdraw yet. 5. Unfortunately, an attacker performed a flash-loan to borrow 8500 WETH, and deposit large amount of WETH into the bathWETH gain significant share of the pool, and then withdraw the all the shares immediately. 6. Since attacker hold the an overwhelming amount of shares in the pool, they will receive almost all the `bonusToken` (around 997 DAI) in the BathBuddy Vesting wallet, leaving behind dust amount of `bonusToken` in the wallet. 7. At this point, Alice decided to withdraw all her bathWETH LP token. She only received dust amount of 0.7 DAI as `bonusTokens`  The following code shows that the amount of `bonusTokens` a user is entitled is based on the user's current share in the pool - `amount = releasable * sharesWithdrawn/initialTotalSupply`.

BathToken LPs not able to receive the accured `bonusToken` that they are entitled to.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update the reward mechanism to ensure that the `bonusTokens` are distribute fairly and rewards of each user are accured correctly.  In the above example, since Alice hold 50% of the shares in the pool throughout the majority of the reward period, she should be entitled to close to 50% to the rewards/bonus. Anyone who join the pool at the last hour of the reward period should only be entitled dust amount of `bonusToken`.  Additionally, "spot" (or current) share of the pool should not be used to determine the amount of `bonusToken` a user is entitled to as it is vulnerable to pool/share manipulation or flash-loan attack. Checkpointing mechanism should be implemented so that at the minimum, the user's amount of share in the previous block is used for determining the rewards. This make flash-loan attack infeasible as such attack has to happen within the same block/transaction.  For distributing bonus/rewards, I would suggest checking out a widely referenced [Synthetix's Reward](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) Contract as I think that it would be more relevant than OZ's Vesting Wallet for this particular purpose.
