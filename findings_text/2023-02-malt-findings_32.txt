# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-malt/blob/main/contracts/StabilityPod/StabilizerNode.sol#L163   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `StabilizerNode.stabilize()` should update `lastTracking` as well to avoid an unnecessary incentive.  Current logic pays unnecessary incentives to track the pool.  ## Proof of Concept `trackPool()` pays an incentive per `trackingBackoff` in order to ensure pool consistency.  ```solidity File: 2023-02-malt\contracts\StabilityPod\StabilizerNode.sol 248:   function trackPool() external onlyActive { 249:     require(block.timestamp >= lastTracking + trackingBackoff, "Too early"); //@audit lastTracking should be updated in stabilize() also 250:     bool success = maltDataLab.trackPool(); 251:     require(success, "Too early"); 252:     malt.mint(msg.sender, (trackingIncentive * (10**malt.decimals())) / 100); // div 100 because units are cents 253:     lastTracking = block.timestamp; 254:     emit Tracking(); 255:   } ```  And `stabilize()` tracks the pool as well and we don't need to pay an incentive unnecessarily in `trackPool()` if `stabilize()` was called recently.  For that, we can update `lastTracking` in `stabilize()`.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend updating `lastTracking` in `stabilize()`.  ```solidity   function stabilize() external nonReentrant onlyEOA onlyActive whenNotPaused {     // Ensure data consistency     maltDataLab.trackPool();     lastTracking = block.timestamp; //++++++++++++++++      ... ```
