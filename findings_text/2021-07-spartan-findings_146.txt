# Handle  maplesyrup   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas optimizations Does not affect the contract in any harmful way. Suggestions allow for smart contract gas optimizations.  ## Proof of Concept According to Slither analyzer documentation (https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#state-variables-that-could-be-declared-constant), the variable in contract Utils.sol called "one" or Utils.one can be set to a constant as it is considered a variable that does not change throughout the contract.   Slither Detectors:  constable-states:  Utils.one (contracts/Utils.sol, lines#11) should be constant  ------------  Code in contract:  uint public one = 10**18; <---- can be constant as it does not change  --------------  Console output (via Slither in JSON format):    "constable-states": [     "Utils.one (contracts/Utils.sol#11) should be constant\n"   ],  ## Tools Used  Spartan Contracts Solidity (v 0.8.3) Slither Analyzer (v 0.8.0)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Clone repository for Spartan Smart Contracts 2. Create a python virtual environment with a stable python version 3. Install Slither Analyzer on the python VEM 4. Run Slither against all contracts
