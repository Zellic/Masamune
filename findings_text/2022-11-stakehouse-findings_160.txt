However the formula is not correct.    In each iteration of the foor loop, `accumulated` is assigned a new value ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantMevAndFeesPool.sol#L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantMevAndFeesPool.sol#L91)) when actually the value should be updated like this:   ```solidity accumulated += StakingFundsVault(payable(_stakingFundsVaults[i])).batchPreviewAccumulatedETH(         address(this),         _lpTokens[i]     ); ```  Obviously the `accumulated` value must be calculated for all stakingFundVaults not only for one stakingFundsVault.    While this calculation is not used internally by the contract, it will cause any third-party contract that relies on this calculation to behave incorrectly.    For example a third party smart contract might only allow users to withdraw once the value returned by `previewAccumulatedETH` reaches a certain threshold. Because of the issue however the accumulated ETH value that is returned will always be too low.    ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Fix:   ```solidity @@ -88,7 +88,7 @@ contract GiantMevAndFeesPool is ITransferHookProcessor, GiantPoolBase, Syndicate            uint256 accumulated;          for (uint256 i; i < _stakingFundsVaults.length; ++i) { -            accumulated = StakingFundsVault(payable(_stakingFundsVaults[i])).batchPreviewAccumulatedETH( +            accumulated += StakingFundsVault(payable(_stakingFundsVaults[i])).batchPreviewAccumulatedETH(                  address(this),                  _lpTokens[i]              ); ```
