# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `RocketJoeStaking.lastRewardTimestamp` is initialized to zero. Usually, this does not matter as `updatePool` is called before the first deposit and when `joeSupply = joe.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0`, it is set to the current time.  ```solidity function updatePool() public {     if (block.timestamp <= lastRewardTimestamp) {         return;     }     uint256 joeSupply = joe.balanceOf(address(this));      // @audit lastRewardTimestamp is not initialized. can send 1 Joe to this contract directly => lots of rJoe minted to this contract     if (joeSupply == 0) {         lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp;         return;     }     uint256 multiplier = block.timestamp - lastRewardTimestamp;     uint256 rJoeReward = multiplier * rJoePerSec;     accRJoePerShare =         accRJoePerShare +         (rJoeReward * PRECISION) /         joeSupply;     lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp;      rJoe.mint(address(this), rJoeReward); } ```  However, if a user first directly transfers `Joe` tokens to the contract before the first `updatePool` call, the `block.timestamp - lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp` will be a large timestamp value and lots of `rJoe` will be minted (but not distributed to users). Even though they are not distributed to the users, inflating the `rJoe` total supply might not be desired.  #### Recommendation Consider tracking the actual total deposits in a storage variable and using this value instead of the current balance for `joeSupply`. This way, transferring tokens to the contract has no influence and depositing through `deposit` first calls `updatePool` and initializes `lastRewardTimestamp`.
