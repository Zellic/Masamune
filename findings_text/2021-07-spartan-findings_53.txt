# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  In DaoVault and BondVault, the following mappings are declared private:  - `mapMember_weight` - `mapMemberPool_weight`  The DaoVault has an additional private mapping `mapMemberPool_balance`.  Despite this, the DaoVault has getter methods for all 3 mappings, whilst the BondVault only has a getter method for `mapMember_weight`.  The getter methods (which aren't included in the interface) would be unnecessary if the mappings are declared as public. Also, the BondVault might perhaps be lacking a view method for `mapMemberPool_weight`.   Should the separate getter methods remain unchanged, note that the getter method for `getMemberWeight()` has a convoluted implementation:  ```jsx function getMemberWeight(address member) external view returns (uint256) {  if (mapMember_weight[member] > 0) {   return mapMember_weight[member];   } else {     return 0;     } } ```  which can be simplified to simply returning the `mapMember_weight[member]`.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  - Declare the relevant private mappings as public. - Kindly check if `mapMemberPool_weight` should be public for the BondVault as well, since it is the case for the DaoVault.
