# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `sendToCosmos` function of `Gravity` transfers `_amount` of `_tokenContract` from the sender using the function `transferFrom`. If the transferred token is a transfer-on-fee/deflationary token, the actually received amount could be less than `_amount`. However, since `_amount` is passed as a parameter of the `SendToCosmosEvent` event, the Cosmos side will think more tokens are locked on the Ethereum side.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Gravity.sol#L535](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L535) [Gravity.sol#L541](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L541)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider getting the received amount by calculating the difference of token balance (using `balanceOf`) before and after the `transferFrom`.
