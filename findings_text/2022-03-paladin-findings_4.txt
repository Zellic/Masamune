# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L25   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In `HolyPaladinToken.sol` the `ONE_YEAR` variable claims that there are `31557600` seconds in a year when this is incorrect.  The `ONE_YEAR` variable is used in the `getCurrentVotes()` function as well as the `getPastVotes()` function so it is vital that the correct time in seconds be used as it can effect users negatively.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L25  86,400 seconds in a day x 365 = 31_536_000  ## Tools Used Manual code review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The correct number of seconds in a year is 31_536_000 so the `ONE_YEAR` variable should be changed to `ONE_YEAR = 31_536_000`
