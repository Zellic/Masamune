The issue is _afterTokenTransfer() callback running the _moveDelegateVotes() with an owner instead of her delegate. As Alice's votes in the checkpoint is zero after she delegated them, the subtraction _moveDelegateVotes() tries to perform during the move of the votes will be reverted.  As ERC721Votes is parent to Token and delegate is a kind of common and frequent operation, the impact is governance token moves being frozen in a variety of use cases, which interferes with governance voting process and can be critical for the project.  ## Proof of Concept  Suppose Alice delegated all her votes to herself and then decided to delegate them to someone else with either delegate() or delegateBySig() calling _delegate():  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L190  ```solidity     function _delegate(address _from, address _to) internal {         // Get the previous delegate         address prevDelegate = delegation[_from];          // Store the new delegate         delegation[_from] = _to;          emit DelegateChanged(_from, prevDelegate, _to);          // Transfer voting weight from the previous delegate to the new delegate         _moveDelegateVotes(prevDelegate, _to, balanceOf(_from));     } ```  _moveDelegateVotes() will set her votes to `0` as `_from == Alice` and `prevTotalVotes = _amount = balanceOf(Alice)` (as _afterTokenTransfer() incremented Alice's vote balance on each mint to her):  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L196-L217  ```solidity     function _moveDelegateVotes(         address _from,         address _to,         uint256 _amount     ) internal {         unchecked {             // If voting weight is being transferred:             if (_from != _to && _amount > 0) {                 // If this isn't a token mint:                 if (_from != address(0)) {                     // Get the sender's number of checkpoints                     uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[_from]++;                      // Used to store the sender's previous voting weight                     uint256 prevTotalVotes;                      // If this isn't the sender's first checkpoint: Get their previous voting weight                     if (nCheckpoints != 0) prevTotalVotes = checkpoints[_from][nCheckpoints - 1].votes;                      // Update their voting weight                     _writeCheckpoint(_from, nCheckpoints, prevTotalVotes, prevTotalVotes - _amount);                 } ```  After that her votes in the checkpoint become zero. She will not be able to transfer the NFT as `_afterTokenTransfer` will revert on `_moveDelegateVotes`'s attempt to move `1` vote from `Alice` to `_to`, while `checkpoints[Alice][nCheckpoints - 1].votes` is `0`:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L262-L268  ```solidity     function _afterTokenTransfer(         address _from,         address _to,         uint256 _tokenId     ) internal override {         // Transfer 1 vote from the sender to the recipient         _moveDelegateVotes(_from, _to, 1); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The root issue is _afterTokenTransfer() dealing with Alice instead of Alice's delegate.  Consider including delegates() call as a fix:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L262-L268  ```solidity     function _afterTokenTransfer(         address _from,         address _to,         uint256 _tokenId     ) internal override {         // Transfer 1 vote from the sender to the recipient -       _moveDelegateVotes(_from, _to, 1); +       _moveDelegateVotes(delegates(_from), delegates(_to), 1); ```  As `delegates(address(0)) == address(0)` the burning/minting flow will persist:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L124-L129  ```solidity     /// @notice The delegate for an account     /// @param _account The account address     function delegates(address _account) external view returns (address) {         address current = delegation[_account];         return current == address(0) ? _account : current;     } ```
