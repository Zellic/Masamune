# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The `public` functions `Factory.setMinLicenseFee()`, `Factory.setAuctionDecrement()`, `Factory.setAuctionMultiplier()`, `Factory.setBondPercentDiv()`, `Factory.setOwnerSplit()` and `Factory.proposeBasketLicense()` are never called by `Factory`. Therefore, their visibility can be reduced to `external`.  ## Impact `external` functions are cheaper than `public` functions.  ## Proof of Concept https://gus-tavo-guim.medium.com/public-vs-external-functions-in-solidity-b46bcf0ba3ac  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Define these functions as `public`.
