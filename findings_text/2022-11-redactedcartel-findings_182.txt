This is required because the vault needs to deposit GMX tokens to the platform (PirexGMX) contract. During deposit, the platform (PirexGMX) contract will pull the GMX tokens within the vault and send them to GMX protocol for staking. Otherwise, the deposit feature within the vault will not work.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-redactedcartel/blob/03b71a8d395c02324cb9fdaf92401357da5b19d1/src/vaults/AutoPxGmx.sol#L73  ```solidity File: AutoPxGmx.sol 73:     constructor( 74:         address _gmxBaseReward, 75:         address _gmx, 76:         address _asset, 77:         string memory _name, 78:         string memory _symbol, 79:         address _platform, 80:         address _rewardsModule 81:     ) Owned(msg.sender) PirexERC4626(ERC20(_asset), _name, _symbol) { 82:         if (_gmxBaseReward == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 83:         if (_gmx == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 84:         if (_asset == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 85:         if (bytes(_name).length == 0) revert InvalidAssetParam(); 86:         if (bytes(_symbol).length == 0) revert InvalidAssetParam(); 87:         if (_platform == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 88:         if (_rewardsModule == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 89:  90:         gmxBaseReward = ERC20(_gmxBaseReward); 91:         gmx = ERC20(_gmx); 92:         platform = _platform; 93:         rewardsModule = _rewardsModule; 94:  95:         // Approve the Uniswap V3 router to manage our base reward (inbound swap token) 96:         gmxBaseReward.safeApprove(address(SWAP_ROUTER), type(uint256).max); 97:         gmx.safeApprove(_platform, type(uint256).max); 98:     } ```  However, when the owner calls the `AutoPxGmx.setPlatform` function to update the `platform` to a new address, it does not grant any allowance to the new platform address. As a result, the new platform (PirexGMX) will not be able to pull the GMX tokens from the vault. Thus, the deposit feature of the vault will break, and no one will be able to deposit.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-redactedcartel/blob/03b71a8d395c02324cb9fdaf92401357da5b19d1/src/vaults/AutoPxGmx.sol#L152  ```solidity File: AutoPxGmx.sol 152:     function setPlatform(address _platform) external onlyOwner { 153:         if (_platform == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); 154:  155:         platform = _platform; 156:  157:         emit PlatformUpdated(_platform); 158:     } ```  ## Impact  The deposit feature of the vault will break, and no one will be able to deposit.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Ensure that allowance is given to the new platform address so that it can pull the GMX tokens from the vault.  ```diff function setPlatform(address _platform) external onlyOwner {     if (_platform == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); +   if (_platform == platform) revert SamePlatformAddress();      +   gmx.safeApprove(platform, 0); // set the old platform approval amount to zero +   gmx.safeApprove(_platform, type(uint256).max); // approve the new platform contract address allowance to the max      platform = _platform;      emit PlatformUpdated(_platform); } ```
