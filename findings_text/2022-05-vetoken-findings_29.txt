However, the `incentiveVeAsset` variable is only updated to zero after an external call to the `ITokenMinter` contract. This lacks the Checks Effects and Interactions safety pattern. In the event that the **wrong** minter contract has been initialised, an attacker could potentially drain all the additional reward tokens via a reentrancy attack.  ## Proof of Concept  - <https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html>  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Be sure to follow the [Checks Effects and Interactions safety pattern](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html) and update the `incentiveVeAsset = 0` before minting the token for the user. Alternatively, the developers can also add the `nonReentrant()` [modifier](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard) from OpenZeppelin to prevent any sort of potential reentrancy attacks.
