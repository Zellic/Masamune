# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L46  The comment at `poolFactory` L46  is a bit misleading. ``` require(getPool(token) == address(0)); // Must be a valid token ```  A similar checks in `synthFactory` seems to be more clear. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/synthFactory.sol#L38  ```         require(getSynth(token) == address(0), "exists"); // Synth must not already exist ```  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L46 ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It seems that `PoolFactory` is the only contract that does not provide detailed revert messages. I wonder whether the devs do this because of the concern about the code size limit. If that's the case, I recommend refactoring it to libraries or even uses a proxy factory to create new pools.
