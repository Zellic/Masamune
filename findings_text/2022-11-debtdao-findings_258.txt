The lender will be left with a bad debt and the borrower will keep the borrowed amount and the collateral. ## Proof of Concept The `close` function of `LineOfCredit` doesn't check whether a credit exists or not. As a result, the `count` variable is decreased in the internal `_close` function when the `close` function is called with an non-existent credit ID: [LineOfCredit.sol#L388](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L388): ```solidity function close(bytes32 id) external payable override returns (bool) {     Credit memory credit = credits[id];     address b = borrower; // gas savings     if(msg.sender != credit.lender && msg.sender != b) {       revert CallerAccessDenied();     }      // ensure all money owed is accounted for.
