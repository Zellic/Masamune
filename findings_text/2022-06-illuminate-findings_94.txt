The 0 index is incorrectly used in Pendle `lend()` function as the output amount. As a result the value of `returned` will be the invalid (i.e. the input rather than the output).  Since this impacts how many PTs will be minted to the `msg.sender`, the value will very likely be significantly over or under stated depending on the exchange rate. Hence the `msg.sender` will receive an invalid number of PT tokens.  ## Proof of Concept  ```solidity             address[] memory path = new address[](2);             path[0] = u;             path[1] = principal;              returned = IPendle(pendleAddr).swapExactTokensForTokens(a - fee, r, path, address(this), d)[0]; ```   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The amount of `principal` returned should be index 1 of the array returned by `swapExactTokensForTokens()`.
