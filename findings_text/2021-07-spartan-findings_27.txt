# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  2 conditions enable the `DEPLOYER` to drain the funds in the DAOVault.  - `DAOVault` is missing `purgeDeployer()` function - `onlyDAO()` is callable by both the `DAO` and the `DEPLOYER`  The `DEPLOYER` can, at any time, call `depositLP()` to increase the LP funds of any account, then call `withdraw()` to withdraw the entire balance.  The only good use case for the `DEPLOYER` here is to help perform emergency withdrawals for users. However, this could use a separate modifier, like `onlyDeployer()`.  ### Proof of Concept  1. `DEPLOYER` calls `depositLP()` with any arbitrary amount (maybe DAOVault's pool LP balance - Alice's deposited LP balance) for Alice and pool to increase their weight and balance. 2. At this point, Alice may vote for a proposal to swing it in her favour, or remove it otherwise (to implicitly vote against it) 3. `DEPLOYER` calls `withdraw()` for the Alice, which removes 100% of her balance (and therefore, the entire DAOVault's pool balance)  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  - Create a separate role and modifier for the `DEPLOYER`, so that he is only able to call `withdraw()` but not `depositLP()` - Include the missing `purgeDeployer()` function.
