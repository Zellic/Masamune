# Handle  loop   # Vulnerability details  When invoking `purchaseArbitrageTokens()` is will first check whether the auction is active using: ``` require(auctionActive(currentAuctionId), "No auction running"); ``` `auctionActive()` checks for the following things: ``` auction.active && now >= auction.startingTime; ``` As a result the require statement will fail if either `!auction.active` or `now < auction.startingTime`.   Later on in `purchaseArbitrageTokens()` two more require statements will check the same thing: ``` require(auction.startingTime <= now, "Auction hasn't started yet"); (...)  require(auction.active == true, "Auction is not active"); ``` These will always pass if `auctionActive(currentAuctionId)` is `true` and never be reached if it is `false`, making them redundant.  ## Proof of Concept - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L178 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L188-L190 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L268-L272  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove redundant require statements
