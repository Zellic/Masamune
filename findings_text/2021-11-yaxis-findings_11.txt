# Handle  TimmyToes   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas saving on deployment. Guaranteed consistency, especially if making the same check across multiple functions (and I'm about to suggest that you might want to check this more). Increased functionality of inheriting contracts. Improved readability and code organisation. Basically, every reason that modifiers exist in the first place.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/Alchemist.sol#L457 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/Alchemist.sol#L489  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Convert emergency exit check to modifier.
