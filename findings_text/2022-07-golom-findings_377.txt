The `removeDelegation` function is external, so when the call is done by `this.removeDelegation(_tokenId)` msg.sender changes to the contract address.  This causes the check in the `` function to (most likely) fail because the contract is not the owner of the NFT, and that will make the function revert. `require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');`  ## Tools Used Manual audit (VS Code & my mind)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Make the `removeDelegation` function public and call it without changing the context (i.e. without changing msg.sender to the contract's address).
