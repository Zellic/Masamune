As a result, a task might be completed when a builder doesn't want it.   ## Proof of Concept [approveHash() function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) can set only true so there is no method to cancel already approved hash without [passing validation here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L891).  So the below scenario would be possible.  - A builder, GC, and SC started a task and SC finished the task. - They are approved to complete the task and signed the signature. - But right before to call [setComplete()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L330) using the signature, the SC felt the cost is too low and raised a dispute to change the order using [raiseDispute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L493). - As I suggested with another medium issue, the task can't be completed when there is an ongoing dispute from [this document - "If there is no ongoing dispute about that project, task status is updated and payment is made."](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor#tasks-completion-and-payment). So `setComplete()` might revert. - Even if it doesn't check active disputes as now, `setComplete()` might revert when the funds haven't been allocated and a builder signed by fault. - After that, the HomeFi admin accepted the dispute, and the cost of the task was increased as SC wanted. - Then the builder would hope to get more results (or scores) from this task as the cost is increased rather than completed right away. - But SC can call `setComplete()` using the previous signature and complete the task without additional work. - A builder might know about that before and try to update task hash but it will revert because SC doesn't agree to [updateTaskHash()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L283). - In this case, it's logical to cancel the approved hash [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) but there is no such option.   I don't know if there would be similar problems with other functions that use signature and I think it would reduce the risk a little if we add an option to cancel the approved hash.   ## Tools Used Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Recommend modifying [approveHash()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) like below.  ``` function approveHash(bytes32 _hash, bool _bool) external override { //++++++++++++++++++++     address _sender = _msgSender();     // Allowing anyone to sign, as its hard to add restrictions here.     // Store _hash as signed for sender.     approvedHashes[_sender][_hash] = _bool; //+++++++++++++++++++      emit ApproveHash(_hash, _sender, _bool); //++++++++++++++++++++++ } ```  I am not so sure that a similar scenario would be possible in the [Community contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L501) also and recommend to change both functions together.
