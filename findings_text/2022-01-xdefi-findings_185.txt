# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  For the arithmetic operations that will never over/underflow, using the unchecked directive (Solidity v0.8 has default overflow/underflow checks) can save some gas from the unnecessary internal over/underflow checks.  ## Proof of Concept  ``` https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/master/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L274 ```  ## Tools Used  None   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider applying unchecked arithmetic where overflow/underflow is not possible.
