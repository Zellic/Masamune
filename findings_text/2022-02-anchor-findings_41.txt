This difference should be negligible in highly active markets, but it could lead to a lower borrow rate in low-activity markets, leading to suppliers losing out on interest.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Ensure that the markets are accrued regularly, or switch to a compound interest formula (which has a higher computational cost due to exponentiation, but can be approximated, see Aave).
