# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It's possible to save gas by optimizing the checks in conditional statements (`if`, `else if` and `else`). This would save a few opcodes and avoid redundant checks.  ## Proof of Concept In `CDSTemplate.sol:deposit()`, the code is as follows: ``` 140:         if (_supply > 0 && _liquidity > 0) {  141:             _mintAmount = (_amount * _supply) / _liquidity; 142:         } else if (_supply > 0 && _liquidity == 0) { 143:             //when vault lose all underwritten asset =  144:             _mintAmount = _amount * _supply; //dilute LP token value af. Start CDS again. 145:         } else { 146:             //when _supply == 0, 147:             _mintAmount = _amount; 148:         } ```  The conditions checks can be optimized with the following (read the `@audit-info` comments for futher information): ```         if (_supply == 0) {              _mintAmount = _amount;         } else if (_liquidity == 0) { // @audit-info : implicit _supply > 0 as above condition is false             //when vault lose all underwritten asset =              _mintAmount = _amount * _supply; //dilute LP token value af. Start CDS again.         } else { // @audit-info : implicit _supply > 0 and _liquidity > 0 as both the previous conditions are false             _mintAmount = (_amount * _supply) / _liquidity;         } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Compact conditions in mentioned logic statements
