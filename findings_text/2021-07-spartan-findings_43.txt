# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  In general, creating invalid proposals is easy due to the lack of validation in the `new*Proposal()` functions.  - The `typeStr` is not validated at all. For example, one can call `newActionProposal()` with `typeStr = ROUTER` or `typeStr = BAD_STRING`, both of which will pass. The first will cause `finaliseProposal()` to fail because the proposed address is null, preventing `completeProposal()` from executing. The second does nothing because it does not equate to any of the check `typeStr`, and so `completeProposal()` isn't executed at all. - Not checking the proposed values are null. The checks only happen in `finaliseProposal()` when the relevant sub-functions are called, like the `move*()` functions.  All of these scenarios lead to a mandatory 15 day wait since proposal creation in order to be cancelled, which prevents the creation of new proposals (in order words, denial of service of the DAO).  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Since the number of proposal types is finite, it is best to restrict and validate the `typeStr` submitted. Specifically,     - `newActionProposal()` should only allow `FLIP_EMISSIONS` and `GET_SPARTA` proposal types     - `newAddressProposal()` should only allow `DAO`, `ROUTER`, `UTILS`, `RESERVE`, `LIST_BOND`, `DELIST_BOND`, `ADD_CURATED_POOL` and  `REMOVE_CURATED_POOL` proposal types     - `newParamProposal()` should only allow `COOL_OFF` and `ERAS_TO_EARN` proposal types 2. Perhaps have a "catch-all-else" proposal that will only call `_completeProposal()` in `finaliseProposal()`  ```jsx function finaliseProposal() external {  ...  } else if (isEqual(_type, 'ADD_CURATED_POOL')){   _addCuratedPool(currentProposal);   } else if (isEqual(_type, 'REMOVE_CURATED_POOL')){     _removeCuratedPool(currentProposal);   } else {   completeProposal(_proposalID);  } } ```  3. Do null validation checks in `newAddressProposal()` and `newParamProposal()`  ```jsx function newAddressProposal(address proposedAddress, string memory typeStr) external returns(uint) {     require(proposedAddress != address(0), "!address");   // TODO: validate typeStr   ... }  function newParamProposal(uint32 param, string memory typeStr) external returns(uint) {     require(param != 0, "!param");   // TODO: validate typeStr   ... } ```
