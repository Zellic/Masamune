# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The `acceptOwner()` external function can be called indefinitely instead of only once. The contract's state doesn't reflect reality. The code doesn't follow the standard implementation of a 2-step ownership transfer.  ## Proof of Concept Here's the current `acceptOwner()` external function, which lacks a reset of `pendingOwner` to `address(0)` : ```     function acceptOwner() external override {         require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, 'E102');         owner = msg.sender;          emit AcceptOwner(msg.sender);     } ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the code to: ```     function acceptOwner() external override {         require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, 'E102');         owner = msg.sender;         pendingOwner = address(0); // @audit : line to add          emit AcceptOwner(msg.sender);     } ```
