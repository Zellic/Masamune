Before the token is actually sent to the contract, `tokensToSend` ERC777 hook is called and Alice reenters `depositFor`. - As the previous deposit hasn't been taken into account, the reentrancy passes the `depositCap` check. - Pool has 2.000 token now, despite the 1.000 deposit cap.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add reentrancy guards to `depositFor`.
