It is possible for an attacker (or any other user who happens to call `fillOrder()` at the same time) to fill the `originalOrder` before `acceptCounterOffer()` cancels it.  The impact is that both `originalOrder` and `order` are filled. The `msg.sender` of `acceptCounterOffer()` is twice as leveraged as they intended to be if the required token transfers succeed.  ## Proof of Concept  [acceptCounterOffer()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L573-L584) calls `cancel()` on the original order, however it will not revert if the order has already been filled. ```solidity     function acceptCounterOffer(         Order memory order,         bytes calldata signature,         Order memory originalOrder     ) public payable returns (uint256 positionId) {         // cancel the original order         cancel(originalOrder);           // accept the counter offer         uint256[] memory floorAssetTokenIds = new uint256[](0);         positionId = fillOrder(order, signature, floorAssetTokenIds);     } ```  [cancel()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L526-L535) does not revert if an order has already been filled it only prevents future `fillOrder()` transactions from succeeding. ```solidity     function cancel(Order memory order) public {         require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");           bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);           // mark the order as cancelled         cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;           emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);     } ```  Therefore any user may front-run the `acceptCounterOffer()` transaction with a `fillOrder()` transaction that fills the original order. As a result the user ends up filling both `order` and `originalOrder`. Then `acceptCounterOffer()` cancels the `originalOrder` which is essentially a no-op since it's been filled and continues to fill the new `order` resulting in both orders being filled.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider having `cancel()` revert if an order has already been filled. This can be done by adding the following line `require(_ownerOf[uint256(orderHash)] == 0)`.
