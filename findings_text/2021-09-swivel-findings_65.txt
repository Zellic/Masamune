# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  # Impact The function transferNotionalFrom of VaultTracker.sol uses temporary variables to store the balances. If the "from" and "to" address are the same then the balance of "from" is overwritten by the balance of "to". This means the balance of "from" and "to" are increased and no balances are decreased, effectively printing money.  Note: transferNotionalFrom can be called via transferVaultNotional by everyone.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/vaulttracker/VaultTracker.sol#L144-L196   function transferNotionalFrom(address f, address t, uint256 a) external onlyAdmin(admin) returns (bool) {     Vault memory from = vaults[f];     Vault memory to = vaults[t];     ...     vaults[f] = from;     ...     vaults[t] = to;    // if f==t then this will overwrite vaults[f]    https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L234-L238 function transferVaultNotional(address u, uint256 m, address t, uint256 a) public returns (bool) {     require(VaultTracker(markets[u][m].vaultAddr).transferNotionalFrom(msg.sender, t, a), 'vault transfer failed');     ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add something like the following:    require (f != t,"Same");
