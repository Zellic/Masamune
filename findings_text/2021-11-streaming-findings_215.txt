# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Streaming` contract allows the `deposit` and `reward` tokens to be the same token.  > I believe this is intended, think Sushi reward on Sushi as is the case with `xSushi`.  The reward and deposit balances are also correctly tracked independently in `depositTokenAmount` and `rewardTokenAmount`. However, when recovering tokens this leads to issues as the token is recovered twice, once for deposits and another time for rewards:  ```solidity function recoverTokens(address token, address recipient) public lock {     // NOTE: it is the stream creators responsibility to save     // tokens on behalf of their users.     require(msg.sender == streamCreator, "!creator");     if (token == depositToken) {         require(block.timestamp > endDepositLock, "time");         // get the balance of this contract         // check what isnt claimable by either party         // @audit-info depositTokenAmount updated on stake/withdraw/exit, redeemedDepositTokens increased on claimDepositTokens         uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens);         // allow saving of the token         ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, excess);          emit RecoveredTokens(token, recipient, excess);         return;     }          if (token == rewardToken) {         require(block.timestamp > endRewardLock, "time");         // check current balance vs internal balance         //         // NOTE: if a token rebases, i.e. changes balance out from under us,         // most of this contract breaks and rugs depositors. this isn't exclusive         // to this function but this function would in theory allow someone to rug         // and recover the excess (if it is worth anything)          // check what isnt claimable by depositors and governance         // @audit-info rewardTokenAmount increased on fundStream         uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount);         ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, excess);          emit RecoveredTokens(token, recipient, excess);         return;     }     // ... ```  #### POC Given `recoverTokens == depositToken`, `Stream` creator calls `recoverTokens(token = depositToken, creator)`.  - The `token` balance is the sum of deposited tokens (minus reclaimed) plus the reward token amount. `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens) + (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount)` - `if (token == depositToken)` executes, the `excess` from the deposit amount will be the reward amount (`excess >= rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount`). This will be transferred. - `if (token == rewardToken)` executes, the new token balance is just the deposit token amount now (because the reward token amount has been transferred out in the step before). Therefore, `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens`. If this is non-negative, the transaction does not revert and the creator makes a profit.  Example: - outstanding redeemable deposit token amount: `depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens = 1000` - funded `rewardTokenAmount` (plus `rewardTokenFeeAmount` fees): `rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount = 500`  Creator receives `1500 - 1000 = 500` excess deposit and `1000 - 500 = 500` excess reward.  ## Impact When using the same deposit and reward token, the stream creator can steal tokens from the users who will be unable to withdraw their profit or claim their rewards.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps One needs to be careful with using `.balanceOf` in this special case as it includes both deposit and reward balances.  Add a special case for `recoverTokens` when `token == depositToken == rewardToken` and then the excess should be `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount);`
