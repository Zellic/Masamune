# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Convenience/contracts/libraries/Borrow.sol#L121-L127   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact ``borrowGivenDebtETHCollateral`` function does never properly call ``ETH.transfer`` due to underflow. If ``borrowGivenDebtETHCollateral`` function is not deprecated, it would cause unexpected behaviors for users.   ## Proof of Concept Here are codes which contain a potential issue.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Convenience/contracts/libraries/Borrow.sol#L121-L127 ``` if (maxCollateral > dueOut.collateral) {     uint256 excess;     unchecked {         excess -= dueOut.collateral;     }     ETH.transfer(payable(msg.sender), excess); } ```  ``excess`` variable is ``uint256``, and ``dueOut.collateral`` variable is ``uint112`` as shown below. Hence, both variables will never be less than 0.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Core/contracts/interfaces/IPair.sol#L22-L26 ``` struct Due {     uint112 debt;     uint112 collateral;     uint32 startBlock; } ```  ``uint256 excess`` is initialized to 0. However, subtracting ``dueOut.collateral`` variable which is more than or equal to 0 from ``excess`` variable which is 0 will be less than 0. Hence, ``excess -= dueOut.collateral`` will be less than 0, and ``excess`` will be underflown.   ## Tools Used static code analysis   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The code should properly initialize ``excess`` variable.  ``borrowGivenPercentETHCollateral`` function uses ``uint256 excess = maxCollateral`` at similar functionality. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Convenience/contracts/libraries/Borrow.sol#L347  Hence, just initializing ``excess`` variable with ``maxCollateral`` can be a potential workaround to prevent the underflown. ``` if (maxCollateral > dueOut.collateral) {     uint256 excess = maxCollateral;     unchecked {         excess -= dueOut.collateral;     }     ETH.transfer(payable(msg.sender), excess); } ```
