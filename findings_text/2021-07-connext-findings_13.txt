# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value. (See [Line 201](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)) The `LIibERC20.approve` function does not do this - unlike OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove` implementation.  ## Impact Repeated USDT cross-chain transfers to the same user on receiving chain = ETH mainnet can fail due to this line not resetting the approval to zero first:  ``` require(LibERC20.approve(txData.receivingAssetId, txData.callTo, toSend), "fulfill: APPROVAL_FAILED"); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps `LiibERC20.approve` should do two `approve` calls, one setting it to `0` first, then the real one. Check OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove`.
