Title: Unnecessary Reentrancy Guards Severity: GAS  Where there is onlyOwner or Initializer modifer, the reentrancy gaurd isn't  necessary (unless you don't trust the owner or the deployer, which will lead to full security breakdown of the project and we believe this is not the case) This is a list we found of such occurrences:           LiquidityFarming.sol no need both nonReentrant and onlyOwner modifiers in reclaimTokens    Title: Change transferFrom to transfer Severity: GAS  'transferFrom(address(this), *, **)' could be replaced by the following more gas efficient 'transfer(*, **)'                This replacement is more gas efficient and improves the code quality.          LiquidityFarming.sol, 250 : lpToken.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msgSender, _nftId);   Title: Public functions to external Severity: GAS  The following functions could be set external to save gas and improve code quality.  External call cost is less expensive than of public functions.           ExecutorManager.sol, getAllExecutors         LPToken.sol, initialize         LPToken.sol, exists         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, initialize   Title: Use unchecked to save gas for certain additive calculations that cannot overflow Severity: GAS   You can use unchecked in the following calculations since there is no risk to overflow:          LiquidityFarming.sol (L#275) - accumulator += rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].rewardsPerSecond * (counter - max(lastUpdatedTime, rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp));    Title: State variables that could be set immutable Severity: GAS  In the following files there are state variables that could be set immutable to save gas.           liquidityProviders in LiquidityFarming.sol         tokenManager in LiquidityPool.sol         lpToken in LiquidityFarming.sol    Title: Use calldata instead of memory Severity: GAS   Use calldata instead of memory for function parameters In some cases, having function arguments in calldata instead of memory is more optimal.               LiquidityPool.depositErc20 (tag)         LPToken.initialize (_symbol)         LiquidityPool.sendFundsToUser (depositHash)         LiquidityPool.permitEIP2612AndDepositErc20 (tag)         LiquidityPool.permitAndDepositErc20 (tag)         LiquidityPool.depositNative (tag)         LPToken.updateTokenMetadata (_lpTokenMetadata)         LiquidityPool.checkHashStatus (depositHash)         LPToken.initialize (_name)    Title: Caching array length can save gas Severity: GAS   Caching the array length is more gas efficient. This is because access to a local variable in solidity is more efficient than query storage / calldata / memory. We recommend to change from:          for (uint256 i=0; i<array.length; i++) { ... }  to:       uint len = array.length       for (uint256 i=0; i<len; i++) { ... }           ExecutorManager.sol, executorArray, 31         TokenManager.sol, tokenConfig, 78         ExecutorManager.sol, executorArray, 47         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, _tokens, 228         LPToken.sol, nftIds, 77         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, _addresses, 180    Title: Storage double reading. Could save SLOAD Severity: GAS  Reading a storage variable is gas costly (SLOAD). In cases of multiple read of a storage variable in the same scope, caching the first read (i.e saving as a local variable) can save gas and decrease the  overall gas uses. The following is a list of functions and the storage variables that you read twice:           LiquidityProviders.sol: BASE_DIVISOR is read twice in _increaseLiquidity    Title: Unnecessary index init Severity: GAS   In for loops you initialize the index to start from 0, but it already initialized to 0 in default and this assignment cost gas.  It is more clear and gas efficient to declare without assigning 0 and will have the same meaning:          WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, 180         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, 228         LPToken.sol, 77         ExecutorManager.sol, 31         ExecutorManager.sol, 47         TokenManager.sol, 78     Title: Consider inline the following functions to save gas Severity: GAS       You can inline the following functions instead of writing a specific function to save gas.     (see https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested-findings/issues/167 for a similar issue.)               TokenManager.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771Context._msgData(); }         TokenManager.sol, _msgSender, { return ERC2771Context._msgSender(); }         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgData(); }         LiquidityPool.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgData(); }         LiquidityFarming.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgData(); }         LiquidityProviders.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgData(); }         LPToken.sol, _msgData, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgData(); }         LiquidityPool.sol, _msgSender, { return ERC2771ContextUpgradeable._msgSender(); }    Title: Use bytes32 instead of string to save gas whenever possible Severity: GAS       Use bytes32 instead of string to save gas whenever possible.     String is a dynamic data structure and therefore is more gas consuming then bytes32.               LPToken.sol (L140), string memory json = Base64.encode( bytes( string( abi.encodePacked( '{"name": "', name(), '", "description": "', description, '", "image": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,', Base64.encode(bytes(svgData)), '", "attributes": ', attributes, "}" ) ) ) );     Title: Unused state variables Severity: GAS  Unused state variables are gas consuming at deployment (since they are located in storage) and are  a bad code practice. Removing those variables will decrease deployment gas cost and improve code quality.  This is a full list of all the unused storage variables we found in your code base.           LPToken.sol, NATIVE    Title: Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments Severity: GAS  Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments.  Further more, using unchecked {++x} is even more gas efficient, and the gas saving accumulates every iteration and can make a real change There is no risk of overflow caused by increamenting the iteration index in for loops (the `++i` in `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i)`). But increments perform overflow checks that are not necessary in this case. These functions use not using prefix increments (`++x`) or not using the unchecked keyword:           just change to unchecked: ExecutorManager.sol, i, 47         just change to unchecked: LiquidityFarming.sol, index, 233         just change to unchecked: LPToken.sol, i, 77         just change to unchecked: WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, i, 228         just change to unchecked: WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, i, 248         just change to unchecked: TokenManager.sol, index, 78         just change to unchecked: WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, i, 180         just change to unchecked: ExecutorManager.sol, i, 31    Title: Unused inheritance Severity: GAS       Some of your contract inherent contracts but aren't use them at all.     We recommend not to inherent those contracts.              TokenManager.sol; the inherited contracts Pausable not used   Title: Internal functions to private Severity: GAS  The following functions could be set private to save gas and improve code quality:          WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, _msgData         LiquidityProviders.sol, _addLiquidity         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, _isSupportedToken   Title: Unused inheritance Severity: GAS       Some of your contract inherent contracts but aren't use them at all.     We recommend not to inherent those contracts.              TokenManager.sol; the inherited contracts Pausable not used   Title: Unused imports Severity: GAS   In the following files there are contract imports that aren't used Import of unnecessary files costs deployment gas (and is a bad coding practice that is important to ignore)          LiquidityPool.sol, line 5, import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, line 6, import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";         WhitelistPeriodManager.sol, line 5, import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/PausableUpgradeable.sol";     Title: Use != 0 instead of > 0 Severity: GAS   Using != 0 is slightly cheaper than > 0. (see https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/75 for similar issue)           LiquidityProviders.sol, 283: change '_amount > 0' to '_amount != 0'         LiquidityPool.sol, 401: change 'balance > 0' to 'balance != 0'         LiquidityPool.sol, 292: change 'balance > 0' to 'balance != 0'
