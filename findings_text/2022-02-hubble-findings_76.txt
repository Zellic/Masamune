However, a `safeTransfer()` to USDC blacklisted user will fail. It will also brick the withdrawal system because the blacklisted user is never cleared.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L53-L67  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Possible solutions: 1st solution: Implement 2-step withdrawals:     - In a for loop, increase the user's amount that can be safely withdrawn.     - A user himself withdraws his balance  2st solution: Skip blacklisted users in a processWithdrawals loop
