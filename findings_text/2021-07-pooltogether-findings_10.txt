# Handle  maplesyrup   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  This is a gas optimization, does not affect the contract negatively, only optimizes it.  ## Proof of Concept  According to Slither Analyzer documentation (https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#public-function-that-could-be-declared-external), functions that are never called within the contract should be declared as external to save gas for the contract.  In this case, there were only 2 functions in the contract that were found that should be declared as external for further gas optimization.  -----------  Code Snippet:  function approveMax() public {...} <---- should be declared external  (contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol, lines #61-65)  function depositToken() public view override returns (address underlyingMasset) {...} <---- should be declared external  (contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol, lines #69-71)   ------------  Console output:  INFO:Detectors: approveMax() should be declared external:  - MStableYieldSource.approveMax() (contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol#61-65) depositToken() should be declared external:  - MStableYieldSource.depositToken() (contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol#69-71) Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#public-function-that-could-be-declared-external  ## Tools Used  PoolTogether Contracts Solidity (v 0.7.4) Hardhat (v 2.5.0) Yarn (v 1.22.10) Slither Analyzer (v 0.8.0)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  1. Clone repository for PoolTogether Smart Contracts 2. Create a python virtual environment with a stable python version 3. Install Slither Analyzer on the python VEM 4. Run Slither against all contracts via artifacts
