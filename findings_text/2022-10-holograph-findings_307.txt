Misbehavior includes (i) downtime, (ii) double-signing transactions, and (iii) abusing transaction speeds. 50% of the slashed HLG will be rewarded to the next operator to execute the transaction, and the remaining 50% will be burned or returned to the Treasury.  The docs also include a guide for the number of slashes and the percentage of bond slashed. However, in the contract, there is no slashing of percentage fees. Rather, the whole _getBaseBondAmount() fee is [slashed from the job.operator instead.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/f8c2eae866280a1acfdc8a8352401ed031be1373/contracts/HolographOperator.sol#L374-L382)  ```         uint256 amount = _getBaseBondAmount(pod);         /**          * @dev select operator that failed to do the job, is slashed the pod base fee          */         _bondedAmounts[job.operator] -= amount;         /**          * @dev the slashed amount is sent to current operator          */         _bondedAmounts[msg.sender] += amount; ```  Documentation states that only a portion should be slashed and the number of slashes should be noted down.   ## Tools Used  Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement the correct percentage of slashing and include a mapping to note down the number of slashes that an operator has
