# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `emergencyWithdraw` function is implemented in all yield sources to allow the `onlyOwner` role to drain the contract's balance in case of emergency. The contract considers ETH as a zero address asset. However, there is a call made on `_asset` which will revert if it is the zero address. As a result, ETH tokens can never be withdrawn from the `NoYield` contract in the event of an emergency.  ## Proof of Concept  Consider the case where `_asset == address(0)`. An external call is made to check the contract's token balance for the target `_asset`. However, this call will revert as `_asset` is the zero address. As a result, the `onlyOwner` role will never be able to withdraw ETH tokens during an emergency.  ``` function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {     require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');     uint256 amount = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));     IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received);     received = amount; } ```  Affected function as per below: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L78-L83  ## Tools Used  Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider handling the case where `_asset` is the zero address, i.e. the asset to be withdrawn under emergency is the ETH token.
