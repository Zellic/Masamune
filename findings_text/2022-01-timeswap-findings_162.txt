# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  In the current implementation, `borrow()` takes a user input value of `zIncrease`, while the actual collateral asset transferred in is calculated at L319, the state of `pool.state.z` still increased by the value of the user's input at L332.  Even though a large number of `zIncrease` means that the user needs to add more collateral, the attacker can use a dust amount `xDecrease` (1 wei for example) so that the total collateral needed is rather small.  Plus, the attacker can always `pay()` the dust amount of loan to get back the rather large amount of collateral added.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L299-L338  ```solidity function borrow(     uint256 maturity,     address assetTo,     address dueTo,     uint112 xDecrease,     uint112 yIncrease,     uint112 zIncrease,     bytes calldata data ) external override lock returns (uint256 id, Due memory dueOut) {     require(block.timestamp < maturity, 'E202');     require(assetTo != address(0) && dueTo != address(0), 'E201');     require(assetTo != address(this) && dueTo != address(this), 'E204');     require(xDecrease > 0, 'E205');      Pool storage pool = pools[maturity];     require(pool.state.totalLiquidity > 0, 'E206');      BorrowMath.check(pool.state, xDecrease, yIncrease, zIncrease, fee);      dueOut.debt = BorrowMath.getDebt(maturity, xDecrease, yIncrease);     dueOut.collateral = BorrowMath.getCollateral(maturity, pool.state, xDecrease, zIncrease);     dueOut.startBlock = BlockNumber.get();      Callback.borrow(collateral, dueOut.collateral, data);      id = pool.dues[dueTo].insert(dueOut);      pool.state.reserves.asset -= xDecrease;     pool.state.reserves.collateral += dueOut.collateral;     pool.state.totalDebtCreated += dueOut.debt;      pool.state.x -= xDecrease;     pool.state.y += yIncrease;     pool.state.z += zIncrease;      asset.safeTransfer(assetTo, xDecrease);      emit Sync(maturity, pool.state.x, pool.state.y, pool.state.z);     emit Borrow(maturity, msg.sender, assetTo, dueTo, xDecrease, id, dueOut); } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/libraries/BorrowMath.sol#L62-L79  ```solidity function getCollateral(     uint256 maturity,     IPair.State memory state,     uint112 xDecrease,     uint112 zIncrease ) internal view returns (uint112 collateralIn) {     uint256 _collateralIn = maturity;     _collateralIn -= block.timestamp;     _collateralIn *= zIncrease;     _collateralIn = _collateralIn.shiftRightUp(25);     uint256 minimum = state.z;     minimum *= xDecrease;     uint256 denominator = state.x;     denominator -= xDecrease;     minimum = minimum.divUp(denominator);     _collateralIn += minimum;     collateralIn = _collateralIn.toUint112(); } ```  ## PoC  Near the maturity time, the attacker can do the following:  1. `borrow()` a dust amount of assets (`xDecrease` = 1 wei) and increase `pool.state.z` to an extremely large value (20x of previous `state.z` in our tests); 2. `pay()` the loan and get back the collateral; 3. `lend()` a regular amount of `state.x`, get a large amount of insurance token; 4. `burn()` the insurance token and get a large portion of the collateral assets from the defaulted loans.  ## Recommendation  Consider making `pair.borrow()` to be `onlyConvenience`, so that `zIncrease` will be a computed value (based on `xDecrease` and current state) rather than a user input value.
