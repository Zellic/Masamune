# Handle  fr0zn   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details On the `AirdropDistribution.sol`, the `airdrop_supply` ([line 462](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L462)) value is set to be `20160000`. However, adding all the `airdropBalances` does show that the value should be `20159997` instead.   ## Impact This does cause some operations on the contract to mislead in the results. This is more noticed on bigger airdropped accounts.  ## Proof of Concept Adding all the `airdropBalances` values do show the difference.  ## Tools Used Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The `airdrop_supply` should be reflecting the actual airdropped balance without misleading the total amount. Change the value to `20159997`.
