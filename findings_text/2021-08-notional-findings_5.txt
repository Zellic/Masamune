# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The code contains "pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;" In the later Solidity versions it is no longer necessary to use the "experimental" version. Using experimental constructions is not recommended for production code.  See: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/layout-of-source-files.html#abiencoderv2  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/Router.sol ```JS pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; ```  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; with pragma abicoder v2;  And make sure you use at least solidity version 0.7.5
