# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The check for array lengths is unnecessary in two places where the following check on txHash will anyway fail if the lengths don’t match with what was hashed earlier during schedule. Removing the length check can save a little gas.  Such a require() in cancel() can be removed because if there is a mismatch, the entry lookup in transactions[] will fail anyway and also, this will not be sceduled/executed.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/utils/TimeLock.sol#L70-L72  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/utils/TimeLock.sol#L81-L85   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Evaluate and remove these checks.
