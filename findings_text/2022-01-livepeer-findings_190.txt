# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  In the current implementation of `DelegatorPool.sol#claim()`, it first requires `claimedInitialStake < initialStake`, or it throws an error of `DelegatorPool#claim: FULLY_CLAIMED`.  However, since it's an `onlyMigrator` function, the felicity of `_delegator` and `_stake` should be assured by the `Migrator` contract, otherwise, this `require` statement itself also can not prevent bad results caused by the wrong inputs.  Furthermore, even if the purpose of this `require` statement is to make sure that `claimedInitialStake` can never surpass the `initialStake`, the expression should be `claimedInitialStake + _stake <= initialStake` instead of `claimedInitialStake < initialStake`.  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/pool/DelegatorPool.sol#L58-L93  ```solidity function claim(address _delegator, uint256 _stake) external onlyMigrator {     require(         claimedInitialStake < initialStake,         "DelegatorPool#claim: FULLY_CLAIMED"     );      // Calculate stake owed to delegator     uint256 currTotalStake = pendingStake();     uint256 owedStake = (currTotalStake * _stake) /         (initialStake - claimedInitialStake);      // Calculate fees owed to delegator     uint256 currTotalFees = pendingFees();     uint256 owedFees = (currTotalFees * _stake) /         (initialStake - claimedInitialStake);      // update claimed balance     claimedInitialStake += _stake;      // Transfer owed stake to the delegator     transferBond(_delegator, owedStake);      // Transfer owed fees to the delegator     IBondingManager(bondingManager).withdrawFees(         payable(_delegator),         owedFees     );      emit Claimed(_delegator, owedStake, owedFees); } ```  ## Recommandation  Consider removing it or changing to:  ```solidity require(     claimedInitialStake + _stake <= initialStake,     "DelegatorPool#claim: FULLY_CLAIMED" ); ```
