Recipients:  - NFT creator(s) - NFT seller - Protocol - Buy referrer (optional)  It is possible to have multiple NFT creators. Sale revenue will be distributed to each NFT creator address. Revenue distribution is done by calling `SendValueWithFallbackWithdraw._sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw` and providing an appropriate gas limit to prevent consuming too much gas. For the revenue distribution to the seller, protocol and the buy referrer, a gas limit of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT = 20_000` is used. However, for the creators, a limit of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS = 210_000` is used. This higher amount of gas is used if `PercentSplitETH` is used as a recipient.  A maximum of `MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS = 5` NFT creator recipients are allowed.  For example, a once honest NFT collection and its 5 royalty creator recipients could turn "malicious" and could "steal" gas from NFT buyers on each NFT sale and therefore grief NFT sales. On each NFT sell, the 5 creator recipients (smart contracts) could consume the full amount of `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS = 210_000` forwarded gas. Totalling `5 * 210_000 = 1_050_000` gas. With a gas price of e.g. `20 gwei`, this equals to additional gas costs of `21_000_000 gwei = 0.028156 eth`, with a `ETH` price of `2000`, this would total to ~`56.31 $` additional costs.  ## Proof of Concept  [mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L130](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/792e00df429b0df9ee5d909a0a5a6e72bd07cf79/contracts/mixins/shared/MarketFees.sol#L130)  ```solidity /**   * @notice Distributes funds to foundation, creator recipients, and NFT owner after a sale.   */ function _distributeFunds(   address nftContract,   uint256 tokenId,   address payable seller,   uint256 price,   address payable buyReferrer )   internal   returns (     uint256 totalFees,     uint256 creatorRev,     uint256 sellerRev   ) {   address payable[] memory creatorRecipients;   uint256[] memory creatorShares;    uint256 buyReferrerFee;   (totalFees, creatorRecipients, creatorShares, sellerRev, buyReferrerFee) = _getFees(     nftContract,     tokenId,     seller,     price,     buyReferrer   );    // Pay the creator(s)   unchecked {     for (uint256 i = 0; i < creatorRecipients.length; ++i) {       _sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw(         creatorRecipients[i],         creatorShares[i],         SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS // @audit-info A higher amount of gas is forwarded to creator recipients       );       // Sum the total creator rev from shares       // creatorShares is in ETH so creatorRev will not overflow here.       creatorRev += creatorShares[i];     }   }    // Pay the seller   _sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw(seller, sellerRev, SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT);    // Pay the protocol fee   _sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw(getFoundationTreasury(), totalFees, SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT);    // Pay the buy referrer fee   if (buyReferrerFee != 0) {     _sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw(buyReferrer, buyReferrerFee, SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT);     emit BuyReferralPaid(nftContract, tokenId, buyReferrer, buyReferrerFee, 0);     unchecked {       // Add the referrer fee back into the total fees so that all 3 return fields sum to the total price for events       totalFees += buyReferrerFee;     }   } } ```  ## Tools Used  Manual review  ## Recommended mitigation steps  Consider only providing a higher amount of gas (`SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLE_RECIPIENTS`) for the first creator recipient. For all following creator recipients, only forward the reduced amount of gas `SEND_VALUE_GAS_LIMIT_SINGLE_RECIPIENT`.
