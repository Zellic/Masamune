# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The _handleTransferIn() functions use a conditional check (_amount > 0) to execute the transfer-in logic of tokens. This should really be a require() to prevent zero amount transfers into the protocol which will allow subsequent logic to execute and potentially utilize any dust/stuck funds from earlier to be accounted to the sender.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L198-L210  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Synth.sol#L202-L206  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L110-L114  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change condition check to a require() which will revert any transfers of zero tokens/funds.
