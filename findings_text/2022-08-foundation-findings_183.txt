If such receiver is a contract that does not support the ERC721 protocol, the NFT will be locked and cannot be retrieved.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L262-L274 ```   function _mint(string calldata tokenCID) private onlyCreator returns (uint256 tokenId) {     require(bytes(tokenCID).length != 0, "NFTCollection: tokenCID is required");     require(!cidToMinted[tokenCID], "NFTCollection: NFT was already minted");     unchecked {       // Number of tokens cannot overflow 256 bits.       tokenId = ++latestTokenId;       require(maxTokenId == 0 || tokenId <= maxTokenId, "NFTCollection: Max token count has already been minted");       cidToMinted[tokenCID] = true;       _tokenCIDs[tokenId] = tokenCID;       _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);       emit Minted(msg.sender, tokenId, tokenCID, tokenCID);     }   } ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L171-L187 ```   function mintCountTo(uint16 count, address to) external onlyMinterOrAdmin returns (uint256 firstTokenId) {     require(count != 0, "NFTDropCollection: `count` must be greater than 0");      unchecked {       // If +1 overflows then +count would also overflow, unless count==0 in which case the loop would exceed gas limits       firstTokenId = latestTokenId + 1;     }     latestTokenId = latestTokenId + count;     require(latestTokenId <= maxTokenId, "NFTDropCollection: Exceeds max tokenId");      for (uint256 i = firstTokenId; i <= latestTokenId; ) {       _mint(to, i);       unchecked {         ++i;       }     }   } ```  For reference, [OpenZeppelin's documentation for `_mint`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_mint-address-uint256-) states: "Usage of this method is discouraged, use _safeMint whenever possible".  ## Proof of Concept The following steps can occur when minting an NFT of a NFT collection or NFT drop collection. 1. The [`_mint`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L262-L274) or [`mintCountTo`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L171-L187) function is called with `msg.sender` or the `to` input corresponding to a contract. 2. The OpenZeppelin's `ERC721Upgradeable` contract's [`_mint`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function is called with `msg.sender` or `to` used in Step 1 as the receiver address. 3. Since calling the OpenZeppelin's `ERC721Upgradeable` contract's [`_mint`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function does not execute the same contract's [`_checkOnERC721Received`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L400-L422) function, it is unknown if the receiving contract inherits from the `IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable` interface and implements the `onERC721Received` function or not. It is possible that the receiving contract does not support the ERC721 protocol, which causes the minted NFT to be locked.  ## Tools Used VSCode  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTCollection.sol#L271 can be changed to the following code. ``` _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId); ```  Also, https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation/blob/main/contracts/NFTDropCollection.sol#L182 can be changed to the following code. ``` _safeMint(to, i); ```
