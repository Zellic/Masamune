# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  WJLP set configuration variables via setAddresses initialize function that has no access controls, so whenever it is being run not atomically with contract creation it can be front run by an attacker. The fix is to redeploy the contracts.  ## Proof of Concept  WJLP.setAddresses: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L102  WJLP.constructor: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/AssetWrappers/WJLP/WJLP.sol#L82  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  a. Either set access rights in the constructor and restrict initialize access b. Or run setAddresses atomically along with contract construction each time  It is also advised to check for zero addressed supplied by a caller both in constructor and setAddresses. Misconfiguration with zero address also leads to redeployment.
