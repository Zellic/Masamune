This makes it possible for `storedTotalAssets -= amount` to revert when the withdrawal amount exceeds `storedTotalAssets`, as the withdrawal amount may include part of the `unlockedRewards` in the current cycle.  ### PoC  Given:  - rewardsCycleLength = 100 days  1. Alice `deposit()` 100 TRIBE tokens; 2. The owner transferred 100 TRIBE tokens as rewards and called `syncRewards()`; 3. 1 day later, Alice `redeem()` with all shares, the transaction will revert at `xERC4626.beforeWithdraw()`.  Alice's shares worth 101 TRIBE at this moment, but `storedTotalAssets` = 100, making `storedTotalAssets -= amount` reverts due to underflow.  4. Bob `deposit()` 1 TRIBE tokens; 5. Alice `withdraw()` 101 TRIBE tokens, `storedTotalAssets` becomes `0`; 6. Bob can't even withdraw 1 wei of TRIBE token, as `storedTotalAssets` is now `0`.  If there are no new deposits, both Alice and Bob won't be able to withdraw any of their funds until `rewardsCycleEnd`.  ### Recommendation  Consider changing to:  ```solidity function beforeWithdraw(uint256 amount, uint256 shares) internal virtual override {     super.beforeWithdraw(amount, shares);     uint256 _storedTotalAssets = storedTotalAssets;     if (amount >= _storedTotalAssets) {         uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();         // _totalAssets - _storedTotalAssets == unlockedRewards         lastRewardAmount -= _totalAssets - _storedTotalAssets;         lastSync = block.timestamp;         storedTotalAssets = _totalAssets - amount;     } else {         storedTotalAssets = _storedTotalAssets - amount;     } } ```
