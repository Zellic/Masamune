# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The uint32 conversion in setWinner of the RCMarket doesn't work as expected. The first statement: "uint32(block.timestamp)" already first the block.timestamp in a uint32. If it is larger than type(uint32).max it wraps around and starts with 0 again The testcode below shows this.  Check for "<= type(uint32).max" in the second statement is useless because _blockTimestamp is always  <= type(uint32).max  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L507  function setWinner(uint256 _winningOutcome) internal { ...             uint256 _blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);             require(_blockTimestamp <= type(uint32).max, "Overflow");   //Testcode: pragma solidity 0.8.7; contract Convert {    uint256 public a = uint256( type(uint32).max )+1; // a==4294967296    uint32  public b = uint32(a); // b==0    uint256 public c = uint32(a); // c==0 }     ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Do the require first (without a typecast to uint32):              require( block.timestamp <= type(uint32).max, "Overflow");             uint256 _blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
