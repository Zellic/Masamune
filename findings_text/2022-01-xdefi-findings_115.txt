# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  It's a best practice to use constant variables rather than literal values to make the code easier to understand and maintain.  Consider defining a constant variable for the literal value used and giving it a clear and self-explanatory name.  Instances include:  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L82-L82  ```solidity require(duration <= uint256(18250 days), "INVALID_DURATION"); ```  Consider changing `uint256(18250 days)` to `MAX_DURATION` constant.
