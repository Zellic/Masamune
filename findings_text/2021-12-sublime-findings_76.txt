# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Possible confusion  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L326-L368  Compare this to the standard ERC20 versions.  ``` approve(address spender, uint256 amount)  vs   approve(uint256 amount, address token, address to)  ```  Having the amount at the beginning is very odd imo and I'd expect it at the end.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change `approve(uint256 amount, address token, address to)` to `approve(address token, address to, uint256 amount)` and similar for other functions.  I'd also change `to` to the standard `spender` but this is nbd.
