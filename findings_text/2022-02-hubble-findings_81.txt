The solution uses: `"@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.2.0"`. This dependency has a known high severity vulnerability: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTS-2320176 Which makes this contract vulnerable: ``` File: Governable.sol 05: import { Initializable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol"; ... 24: contract Governable is VanillaGovernable, Initializable {} ```  This contract is inherited at multiple places: ``` contracts/AMM.sol:   11: contract AMM is IAMM, Governable {  contracts/InsuranceFund.sol:   13: contract InsuranceFund is VanillaGovernable, ERC20Upgradeable {  contracts/Oracle.sol:   11: contract Oracle is Governable {  contracts/legos/HubbleBase.sol:   15: contract HubbleBase is Governable, Pausable, ERC2771Context {  contracts/ClearingHouse.sol:   11: contract ClearingHouse is IClearingHouse, HubbleBase {  contracts/MarginAccount.sol:   25: contract MarginAccount is IMarginAccount, HubbleBase { ```   ìnitializer()` is used here: ``` contracts/AMM.sol:   99:     ) external initializer {  contracts/ClearingHouse.sol:   44:     ) external initializer {  contracts/MarginAccount.sol:   124:     ) external initializer {  contracts/Oracle.sol:   20:     function initialize(address _governance) external initializer {  ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Upgrade `@openzeppelin/contracts` to version 4.4.1 or higher.
