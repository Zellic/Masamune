# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/c9297ccd925ebb2c44dbc6eaa3effd8db5d2368a/royalty-vault/contracts/RoyaltyVault.sol#L76-L83   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The owner of `RoyaltyVault` can set `_platformFee` to any arbitrary value (e.g. 100% = 10000) and that share of the contracts balance and future balances will be set to the `platformFeeRecipient` (which is in the owners control) rather than the splitter contract.  As a result the owner can steal the entire contract balance and any future balances avoiding the splitter.  ## Proof of Concept  ```     function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {         platformFee = _platformFee;         emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);     } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  This issue may be mitigated by add a maximum value for the `_platformFee` say 5% (or some reasonable value based on the needs of the platform).  Also consider calling `sendToSplitter()` before adjusting the `platformFee`. This will only allow the owner to change the fee for future value excluding the current contract balance.  Consider the following code. ```     function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {         require(_platformFee < MAX_FEE);         sendToSplitter(); // @audit this will need to be public rather than external         platformFee = _platformFee;         emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);     } ```
