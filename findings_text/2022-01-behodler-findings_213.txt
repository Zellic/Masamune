# Handle  csanuragjain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to contract at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol  2. Observe the configure function which has below require condition  ``` require(priceBoostOvershoot < 100, "Set overshoot to number between 1 and 100."); ```  3. This means priceBoostOvershoot can be set to 0 which contradicts the require statement message mentioning "Set overshoot to number between 1 and 100." ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the require condition to   ``` require(priceBoostOvershoot < 100 && priceBoostOvershoot > 0, "Set overshoot to number between 1 and 100."); ```
