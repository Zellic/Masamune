# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Time ranges are typically open-ended which includes the start & end times, and not close-ended. So the releaseTime would be interpreted as the time it would be released i.e. block.timestamp >= releaseTime would be the expected check here instead of ‘>’. Similarly, on L406, it should be ‘<=‘ instead of ‘<‘.  Impact: Claims of escrow and receipts are expected to succeed in a particular block but they revert and have to wait until the next block.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/Liquidation.sol#L112  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/74e720ee100fd027c592ea44f272231ad4dfa2ab/src/contracts/Liquidation.sol#L406  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Unless justified, change the strict inequality and make it ‘>=‘ and ‘<=‘ to convert open ranges to closed ranges for block.timestamp comparisons.
