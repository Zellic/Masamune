The expectation of the noContract modifier is to allow access only to accounts inside EOA or Whitelist, if access is controlled using ! access control with _account.isContract(), then because isContract() gets the size of the code length of the account in question by relying on extcodesize/address.code.length, this means that the restriction can be bypassed when deploying a smart contract through the smart contract's constructor call.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Modify the code to `require(msg.sender == tx.origin);`
