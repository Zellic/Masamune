Next, by changing settings in a custom reward token that reverts for specific addresses, the owner can prevent that specific receipt owner from withdrawing: ```solidity File: contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol   #1  230               success = success && IERC20(pool.rewardTokens[i]).transfer(receipt.owner, transferAmount); 231           } 232    233           success = success && IERC20(pool.depositToken).transfer(receipt.owner, receipt.amountDepositedWei); 234           require(success, 'Token transfer failed'); ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-factorydao/blob/db415804c06143d8af6880bc4cda7222e5463c0e/contracts/PermissionlessBasicPoolFactory.sol#L230-L234  While the sponsor mentions that malicious tokens make the pool malicious, this particular issue has a straight forward fix outlined below in the mitigation section  ## Tools Used Code inspection  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Rather than reverting the whole withdrawal if only one transfer fails, return a boolean of whether all withdrawals were successful, and allow `withdraw()` to be called multiple times, keeping track of what has been transferred and what hasn't
