(because of `ERC1155` there can be more than one token for a `tokenId`, so it would be possible to transfer it)  ## Proof of Concept This is `_takeOrders()` and `` and `` code: ```   /**    * @notice Internal helper function to take orders    * @dev verifies whether order can be executed    * @param makerOrder the maker order    * @param takerItems nfts to be transferred    * @param execPrice execution price    */   function _takeOrders(     OrderTypes.MakerOrder calldata makerOrder,     OrderTypes.OrderItem[] calldata takerItems,     uint256 execPrice   ) internal {     bytes32 makerOrderHash = _hash(makerOrder);     bool makerOrderValid = isOrderValid(makerOrder, makerOrderHash);     bool executionValid = IComplication(makerOrder.execParams[0]).canExecTakeOrder(makerOrder, takerItems);     require(makerOrderValid && executionValid, 'order not verified');     _execTakeOrders(makerOrderHash, makerOrder, takerItems, makerOrder.isSellOrder, execPrice);   } ``` As you can see it uses `canExecTakeOrder()` to check that it is valid to perform matching. This is `canExecTakeOrder()` and `areTakerNumItemsValid()` and `doTokenIdsIntersect()` code which are used in execution flow to check orders and matching validity: ```   /**    * @notice Checks whether take orders with a higher order intent can be executed    * @dev This function is called by the main exchange to check whether take orders with a higher order intent can be executed.           It checks whether orders have the right constraints - i.e they have the right number of items, whether time is still valid           and whether the nfts intersect    * @param makerOrder the maker order    * @param takerItems the taker items specified by the taker    * @return returns whether order can be executed    */   function canExecTakeOrder(OrderTypes.MakerOrder calldata makerOrder, OrderTypes.OrderItem[] calldata takerItems)     external     view     override     returns (bool)   {     return (makerOrder.constraints[3] <= block.timestamp &&       makerOrder.constraints[4] >= block.timestamp &&       areTakerNumItemsValid(makerOrder, takerItems) &&       doItemsIntersect(makerOrder.nfts, takerItems));   }    /// @dev sanity check to make sure that a taker is specifying the right number of items   function areTakerNumItemsValid(OrderTypes.MakerOrder calldata makerOrder, OrderTypes.OrderItem[] calldata takerItems)     public     pure     returns (bool)   {     uint256 numTakerItems = 0;     uint256 nftsLength = takerItems.length;     for (uint256 i = 0; i < nftsLength; ) {       unchecked {         numTakerItems += takerItems[i].tokens.length;         ++i;       }     }     return makerOrder.constraints[0] == numTakerItems;   }    /**    * @notice Checks whether tokenIds intersect    * @dev This function checks whether there are intersecting tokenIds between two order items    * @param item1 first item    * @param item2 second item    * @return returns whether tokenIds intersect    */   function doTokenIdsIntersect(OrderTypes.OrderItem calldata item1, OrderTypes.OrderItem calldata item2)     public     pure     returns (bool)   {     uint256 item1TokensLength = item1.tokens.length;     uint256 item2TokensLength = item2.tokens.length;     // case where maker/taker didn't specify any tokenIds for this collection     if (item1TokensLength == 0 || item2TokensLength == 0) {       return true;     }     uint256 numTokenIdsPerCollMatched = 0;     for (uint256 k = 0; k < item2TokensLength; ) {       for (uint256 l = 0; l < item1TokensLength; ) {         if (           item1.tokens[l].tokenId == item2.tokens[k].tokenId && item1.tokens[l].numTokens == item2.tokens[k].numTokens         ) {           // increment numTokenIdsPerCollMatched           unchecked {             ++numTokenIdsPerCollMatched;           }           // short circuit           break;         }         unchecked {           ++l;         }       }       unchecked {         ++k;       }     }      return numTokenIdsPerCollMatched == item2TokensLength;   } ``` As you can see there is no logic to check that `token IDs` in one collection of order are different and code only checks that total number of tokens in one `order` matches the number of tokens specified and the ids in one order exists in other list defined. function `doTokenIdsIntersect()` checks to see that `tokens ids` in one collection can match list of specified tokens. because of this check lacking there are some scenarios that can cause fund lose for `ERC1155` tokens (normal `ERC721` requires more strange conditions). here is first example:  1. for simplicity let's assume collection and timestamp are valid and match for orders and token is `ERC1155` 2. `user1` has signed this order: A:`(user1 BUY 3 NFT IDs[(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)] at 15 ETH)` (buy `1` token of each `id=1,2,3`) 3. `NFT ID[1]` fair price is `1 ETH`, `NFT ID[2]` fair price is `2 ETH`, `NFT ID[3]` fair price is `12 ETH` 4. `attacker` who has 3 of `NFT ID[1]` create this list: B:`(NFT IDs[(1,1), (1,1), (1,1)] )` (list to trade `1`token of `id=1` for 3 times) 5. attacker call `takeOrders()` with this parameters: makerOrder: A , takerNfts: B 6. contract logic would check all the conditions and validate and verify orders and their matching (they intersect and total number of token to sell is equal to total number of tokens to buy and all of the B list is inside A list) and perform the transaction. 7. `attacker` would receive `15 ETH` for his 3 token of `NFT ID[1]` and steal `user1` funds. `user1` would receive 3 of `NFT ID[1]` and pays `15 ETH` and even so his order A has been executed he doesn't receive `NFT IDs[(2,1),(3,1)]` and contract would violates his signed parameters.  This examples shows that in verifying one to many order code should verify that one order's one  collection's token ids are not duplicates. (the function `doTokenIdsIntersect()` doesn't check for this).  This scenario is performable to `matchOneToManyOrders()` and `matchOrders()` and but exists in their code (related check logics) too. more important things about this scenario is that it doesn't require off-chain maching engine to make mistake or malicious act, anyone can call `takeOrders()` if NFT tokens are `ERC1155`. for other `NFT` tokens to perform this attack it requires that `seller==buyer` or some other strange cases (like auto selling when receiving in one contract).  ## Tools Used VIM  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps add checks to ensure `order`'s one `collection`'s token ids are not duplicate in `doTokenIdsIntersect()`
