The VTVLVesting contract defines: - a start time (Claim::startTimestamp) and an end time (Claim::endTimestamp) at which vesting starts and ends for a entitled user - the calculated points in time when the fractions of the total amount are released and therefore can be withdrawn (which are defined by Claim::releaseIntervalSecs). The entitled user can either withdraw after each interval elapses, or after the whole vesting period is over or any variant of the two options.  The administrator of the contract can revoke the claim for a user at any time, which for vesting assets is expected. For example an employee with a vesting stock allocation of 1000 shares vesting at each quarter over a period of 4 years, may resign after 2 years and therefore the only half of the shares would be vested and therefore sold by the employee. The employee can either sell them at each quarter, or before, or after resigning, in any case the half of the shares have vested and are by legal right owned by the employee.  The VTVLContract revoke has the following defects: - it ignores the amount already vested and now yet withdrawn - if called, say half-way the total period, just after claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes only the right to vest the remaining part in future. - if called, say half-way the total period, right before the claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes both the already vested amount and the right to vest the remaining part in future.  Raising as high impact because it actually causes: - loss of already vested amounts of a user with a valid claim that has already righteously vested a part but not withdrawn - different outcomes depending on the order in which withdraw and revokeClaim functions are called which means that one of the two behavoiurs is certainly in conflict with the other causing a loss on one of the two sides, contract or claimer (by definition of Vesting rights, the claimer). - lack of trust by the potential claimers/users whch can be at any time deprived of righteously vested amounts.  ## Proof of Concept  The following two tests prove the behaviour difference when the order by which revokeClaim vs withdraw are called, whch shows that the vesting right is not guaranteed.  ```solidity   // NOTE: USES ORIGINAL REVOKE BEHAVIOUR   it('sample revoke use case USER LOSE: employee withdraw immediately after resignation', async () => {     const {tokenContract, vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});      const startTimestamp = await getLastBlockTs() + 100;     const endTimestamp = startTimestamp + 2000;     const terminationTimestamp = startTimestamp + 1000 + 50; // half-way vesting, plus half release interval which shall be discarded     const releaseIntervalSecs = 100;      await vestingContract.createClaim(owner2.address, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);      // move clock to termination timestamp (half-way the vesting period plus a bit, but less than release interval seconds)     await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [terminationTimestamp]);          let availableAmt = await vestingContract.claimableAmount(owner2.address)     // revoke the claim preserving the "already vested but not yet withdrawn amount"     await (await vestingContract.revokeClaim(owner2.address)).wait();          let userBalanceBefore = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);     await expect(vestingContract.connect(owner2).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith('NO_ACTIVE_CLAIM');     let userBalanceAfter = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);      // move the clock to the programmed end of vesting period     await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [endTimestamp]);      // cliffTimestamp < startTimestamp < terminationTimestamp, hence expected cliffAmount + (1/2 * anlinearVestAmount)     let expectedVestedAmount = cliffAmount.add(linearVestAmount.div(2));      // RESIGNING EMPLOYEE LOSES HIS VESTED AMOUNT BECAUSE OF WITHDRAWING IMMEDIATELY AFTER RESIGNATION     expect(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore)).to.be.equal(0);     // VTVLVesting CONTRACT TOOK ALREADY VESTED AMOUNT FROM OWNER2     expect(await vestingContract.finalClaimableAmount(owner2.address)).to.be.equal(0);   });    // NOTE: USES ORIGINAL REVOKE BEHAVIOUR   it('sample revoke use case USER WIN: employee withdraw immediately before resignation', async () => {     const {tokenContract, vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});      const startTimestamp = await getLastBlockTs() + 100;     const endTimestamp = startTimestamp + 2000;     const terminationTimestamp = startTimestamp + 1000 + 50; // half-way vesting, plus half release interval which shall be discarded     const releaseIntervalSecs = 100;      await vestingContract.createClaim(owner2.address, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);      // move clock to termination timestamp (half-way the vesting period plus a bit, but less than release interval seconds)     await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [terminationTimestamp]);      let userBalanceBefore = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);     await (await vestingContract.connect(owner2).withdraw()).wait();     let userBalanceAfter = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);      // revoke the claim preserving the "already vested but not yet withdrawn amount"     await (await vestingContract.revokeClaim(owner2.address)).wait();          // move the clock to the programmed end of vesting period     await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [endTimestamp]);      console.log(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore));     // RESIGNING EMPLOYEE RECEIVES HIS VESTED AMOUNT BY WITHDRAWING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE RESIGNATION     expect(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore)).to.be.greaterThan(0);     expect(await vestingContract.finalClaimableAmount(owner2.address)).to.be.equal(0);   }); ```solidity  ## Tools Used  n/a  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Below are, in order, a test and a diff/patch for a proposed fix. The proposed fix is just an idea at how to fix, or in other words, a way to preserve the already vested amount when claim is revoked.  The diff/patch add a deactivationTimestamp to claim, and a new revokeClaimProper that shall replace the revokeClaim function to correct the behaviour. The deactivationTimestamp is used to track the deactivation time for the claim in order to preserve the amount vested so far and allow the user to withdraw the amount righteously earned so far. The _baseVestedAmount and hasActiveClaim have been updated to do proper math when isActive is false but deactivationTimestamp is greater than 0.  The finalVestedAmount has been update to show the "what would be" amount if the vesting would have reached the claim endTimestamp while the finalClaimableAmount takes into consideration the deactivationTimestamp if the claim has been revoked.  The test shows that the already vested amount (cliff + half way linear vesting) is preserved.  ```solidity diff --git a/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol b/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol index 133f19f..7ab955c 100644 --- a/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol +++ b/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol @@ -34,6 +34,7 @@ contract VTVLVesting is Context, AccessProtected {          // Gives us a range from 1 Jan 1970 (Unix epoch) up to approximately 35 thousand years from then (2^40 / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) ~= 35k)          uint40 startTimestamp; // When does the vesting start (40 bits is enough for TS)          uint40 endTimestamp; // When does the vesting end - the vesting goes linearly between the start and end timestamps +        uint40 deactivationTimestamp;          uint40 cliffReleaseTimestamp; // At which timestamp is the cliffAmount released.
