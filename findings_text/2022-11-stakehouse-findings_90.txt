In other words, the mapping `sETHUserClaimForKnot` is still holding the claimed amount based on the time 5 sETH were staked.  If, after some time, the ETH is accumulated per free floating share for the BLS public key that Alice was staking for, Alice will be qualified to some more ETH to claim (because she has still 2 sETH staked).   If Alice unstakes by calling `unstake(...)` or claim ETH by calling `claimAsStaker(...)`, in both calls, the function `calculateUnclaimedFreeFloatingETHShare` will be called to calculate the amount of unclaimed ETH: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/syndicate/Syndicate.sol#L652  In this function, we will have:  - `stakedBal = sETHStakedBalanceForKnot[BLS][Alice]` = 2 * 10^18  - `userShare = (newAccumulatedETHPerShare * stakedBal) / PRECISION`   The return value which is unclaimed ETH will be: ``` userShare - sETHUserClaimForKnot[BLS][Alice] =  (newAccumulatedETHPerShare * 2 * 10^18) / PRECISION - (5 * 10^18 * accumulatedETHPerFreeFloatingShare) / PRECISION ```  This return value is not correct (it is highly possible to be smaller than 0, and as a result Alice can not claim anything), because the claimed ETH is still based on the time when 5 sETH were staked, not on the time when 2 sETH were remaining/staked.  The vulnerability is that during unstaking, the mapping `sETHUserClaimForKnot` is not updated to the correct value. In other words, this mapping is updated in `_claimAsStaker`, but it is updated based on 5 sETH staked, later when 3 sETH are unstaked, this mapping should be again updated based on the remaing sETH (which is 2 sETH).  As a result, Alice can not claim ETH or she will qualify for less amount.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps The following line should be added on line 274: ``` sETHUserClaimForKnot[_blsPubKey][msg.sender] =                 (accumulatedETHPerShare * sETHStakedBalanceForKnot[_blsPubKey][msg.sender]) / PRECISION ```  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/syndicate/Syndicate.sol#L274
