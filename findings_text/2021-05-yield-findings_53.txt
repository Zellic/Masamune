# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  flashFeeFactor is uninitialized at declaration and so zero initially until set by setFlashFeeFactor(). As indicated in one of the the explainer videos, the idea is to set this by default to uint256.max to disable flash loans by default.  Currently, flash loans are enabled by default with a zero flash fee unless changed by setFlashFeeFactor().  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Join.sol#L26  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Join.sol#L32-L39  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Join.sol#L107-L110  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Join.sol#L117-L119  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield/blob/e4c8491cd7bfa5dc1b59eb1b257161cd5bf8c6b0/contracts/Join.sol#L132   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Initialize at declaration with a reasonable value which could be uint256.max to disable flash loans by default.
