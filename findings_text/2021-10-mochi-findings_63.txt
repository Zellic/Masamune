# Handle  jonah1005   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact MochiEngine allows the operator to change the NFT contract. [MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93) All the vaults would point to a different NFT address. As a result, users would not be access their positions. The entire protocol would be broken.  IMHO, A function that would break the entire protocol shouldn't exist.  I consider this is a high-risk issue. ## Proof of Concept [MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93)  ## Tools Used None ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the function.
