This can cause users to believe they are due X amount but will receive Y.  ## Proof of Concept If the `inflationRecipient` is set, then `poolStakedIntegral` will be incremented in `claimableRewards()` but not in any other function like `allClaimableRewards()` or `poolCheckpoint()`.  If a user calls `claimableRewards()` after the `inflationRepient` has been set, `claimableRewards()` will return a larger value than `allClaimableRewards()` or the amount actually returned by `claimRewards()`.  ## Tools Used Manual review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps To make the logic consistent, `claimableRewards()` needs `if (inflationRecipient == address(0))` added to it.
