# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` to burn their liquidity, it calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#burn()` -> `_updatePosition()`:  https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L525-L553  The `_updatePosition()` function will return `amount0fees` and `amount1fees` of the whole position with the `lower` and `upper` tick and send them to the `recipient` alongside the burned liquidity amounts.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Alice minted $10000 worth of liquidity with `lower` and `upper` tick set to 99 and 199; 2. Alice accumulated $1000 worth of fee in token0 and token1; 3. The attacker can mint a small amount ($1 worth) of liquidity using the same `lower` and `upper` tick; 4. The attacker calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` to steal all the unclaimed yield with the ticks of (99, 199) include the $1000 worth of yield from Alice.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider making `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` always use `address(this)` as `recipient` in:  ```solidity position.pool.burn(abi.encode(position.lower, position.upper, amount, recipient, unwrapBento)); ```  and transfer proper amounts to the user.
