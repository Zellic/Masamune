# Handle  TomFrench   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `NestedReserve.transferFromFactory` is unused and so increases deployment costs for no gain  ## Proof of Concept  `NestedReserve` has a `transferFromFactory` which can be seen not to be used in the codebase (and in the case the `NestedFactory` needs to send tokens to the reserve it can do so directly.)  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedReserve.sol#L55-L60  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove this function.
