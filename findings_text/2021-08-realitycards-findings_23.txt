# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are a number of functions in `RCTreasury.sol` which make external calls to another contract before updating the underlying market balances. More specifically, these affected functions are `deposit()`, `sponsor()`, and `topupMarketBalance()`. As a result, these functions would be prone to reentrancy exploits. However, as `safeTransferFrom()` operates on a trusted ERC20 token (RealityCard's token), this issue is of low severity.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L385-L391 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L561-L563 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCTreasury.sol#L459-L461  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Modify the aforementioned functions such that all state changes are made before a call to the ERC20 token using the `safeTransferFrom()` function.
