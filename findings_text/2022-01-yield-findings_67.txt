# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost due to unnecessary automatic underflow checks.  Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers.  When an overflow or an underflow isn't possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation, or the operation doesn't depend on user input), some gas can be saved by using an `unchecked` block.  https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic  ## Proof of Concept In `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol:_calcRewardIntegral()`, `bal - rewardRemaining` can't underflow at line 222 as the conditional statement line 221 prevents it: ``` File: ConvexStakingWrapper.sol 221:         if (_supply > 0 && (bal - rewardRemaining) > 0) { 222:             rewardIntegral = uint128(rewardIntegral) + uint128(((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply); //@audit-info (bal - rewardRemaining) can't underflow because of above if statement ``` This substraction should get computed inside an `unchecked` block and stored in a variable, which would then be used in the checked calculation for `rewardIntegral`.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Uncheck arithmetic operations when the risk of underflow or overflow is already contained by wrapping them in an `unchecked` block
