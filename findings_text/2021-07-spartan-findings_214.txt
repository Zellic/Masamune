# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In Synth.sol, the function burnSynth() calculates a division between two variables. Since they can be zero, it's better to have a require with a clear error message when the division is not possible, otherwise an user wouldn't know why a transaction reverted.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/main/contracts/Synth.sol#L176  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a require(denom != 0, "LPDebt = 0").
