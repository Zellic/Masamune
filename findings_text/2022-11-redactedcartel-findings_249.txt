At this time, if AutoPxGmx#compound () is called by bot:  AutoPxGmx#compound() -> PirexRewards#.claim() -> old_PirexGmx#claimRewards()  Old_PirexGmx#claimRewards () will return zero rewards  and the reward of AutopXGMX will be lost.   old PirexGmx still can execute https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-redactedcartel/blob/03b71a8d395c02324cb9fdaf92401357da5b19d1/src/PirexGmx.sol#L824-L828  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-redactedcartel/blob/03b71a8d395c02324cb9fdaf92401357da5b19d1/src/PirexGmx.sol#L940-L949  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  There are two ways to solve the problem. 1. set the producer of PirexRewards to the new PirexGmx in completeMigration (). 2. In #migrateReward (), set the old PirexGmx's "pirexRewards" to address(0), so that you can't use the old PirexGmx to get rewards  Simply use the second, such as: ```solidity     function migrateReward() external whenPaused {         if (msg.sender != migratedTo) revert NotMigratedTo();         if (gmxRewardRouterV2.pendingReceivers(address(this)) != address(0))             revert PendingMigration();          // Transfer out any remaining base reward (ie. WETH) to the new contract         gmxBaseReward.safeTransfer(             migratedTo,             gmxBaseReward.balanceOf(address(this))         ); +       pirexRewards ==address(0);   //*** set pirexRewards=0,Avoid claimRewards () being called by mistake.***//     } ``` ```
