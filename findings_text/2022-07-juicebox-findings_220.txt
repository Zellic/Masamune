It might open up possibility to bypass the ballot waiting time depending on the ballot's implementation.  ## Proof of Concept  - [proof of concept](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/a8c6067923a87af8e001c05442258370#file-2022-07-juiceboxv2-t-sol-L77-L115)  The proof of concept is almost the same as [`TestReconfigure::testReconfigureProject`](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2-code4rena/blob/828bf2f3e719873daa08081cfa0d0a6deaa5ace5/contracts/system_tests/TestReconfigure.sol#L77-L114). In the original test, the owner of the project is reconfiguring funding cycle, but it is not in effect immediately because ballot is set. Only after 3 days the newly set funding cycle will be the current one. In the above proof of concept, only one parameter of the funding cycle is modified: `mustStartAtOrAfter` is set to `type(uint56).max`. As the result, the newly set funding cycle is considered as the current one without waiting for the ballot.  The cause of this is missing check on `mustStartAtOrAfter` upon setting [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2-code4rena/blob/828bf2f3e719873daa08081cfa0d0a6deaa5ace5/contracts/JBFundingCycleStore.sol#L306-L312). If the given `_mustStartAtOrAfter` is huge, it will be passed eventually to the `_initFor`, `_packAndStoreIntrinsicPropertiesOf`. Then it will 'overflow' by shifting and set to the funding cycle, which [essentially can be set to any value including the past](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2-code4rena/blob/828bf2f3e719873daa08081cfa0d0a6deaa5ace5/contracts/JBFundingCycleStore.sol#L518-L522). Also, it seems like the number will be also effected because the bigger digit will carry over.  ```solidity // in JBFundingCycleStore::_packAndStoreIntrinsicPropertiesOf // where the `_start` is derived from `_mustStartAtOrAfter`  ./JBFundingCycleStore.sol-518-    // start in bits 144-199. ./JBFundingCycleStore.sol:519:    packed |= _start << 144; ./JBFundingCycleStore.sol-520- ./JBFundingCycleStore.sol-521-    // number in bits 200-255. ./JBFundingCycleStore.sol-522-    packed |= _number << 200; ```  ## Tools Used  foundry  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a check for the `_mustStartAtOrAfter`: ```solidity // example check for _mustSTartAtOrAfter // in JBFundingCycleStore::configureFor  if (_mustStartAtOrAfter > type(uint56).max) revert INVALID_START(); ```
