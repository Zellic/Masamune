# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  When transferring pool tokens to oneself the `Pool._beforeTokenTransfer` overwrites the `effectiveInterestWithdrawn` of the user with a higher amount than expected. It uses the previous balance + the transfer amount instead of just the previous balance:  ```solidity // @audit if from == to: overwrites with last _to statement => bug lenders[_from].effectiveInterestWithdrawn = (_fromBalance.sub(_amount)).mul(_totalRepaidAmount).div(_totalSupply); lenders[_to].effectiveInterestWithdrawn = (_toBalance.add(_amount)).mul(_totalRepaidAmount).div(_totalSupply); ```  # Impact The bug is not in the user's favor and would lead to them being able to withdraw fewer repayments in the future.  #### POC - user calls `Pool.transfer(from=user, to=user, amount=pool.balanceOf(user))` - pending repayments are withdrawn first by the `_withdrawRepayment` calls. (second one does not lead to a second withdrawal as the `effectiveInterestWithdrawn` is already increased in the first call) - `lenders[user].effectiveInterestWithdrawn` is then set using `2 * userBalance`. - This has the effect that the user appears to have claimed twice as many repayments as their balance indicates already and they won't be able to claim anymore for a while.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We still recommend fixing this bug, for example, by disallowing self-transfers.
