# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It would be helpful if function build explicitly check that seriesId != bytes12(0). In practice, it is not possible to have a series with an id of 0, so this check will not pass:     require (ilks[seriesId][ilkId] == true, "Ilk not added to series"); however, the error message is not very informative, thus I am suggesting adding an explicit check.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps require (seriesId != bytes12(0), "Series id is zero");
