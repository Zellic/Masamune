# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L192   # Vulnerability details  `withdraw` will revert if the account has not been settled yet. This is just due to the implementation and can be avoided by, well, settling the account.  ## Impact `withdraw` reverts unnecessarily. Protocols and users which will use wfCash4626 will have to discover this and settle by themselves.  ## Proof of Concept `withdraw` [calls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L192) `previewWithdraw`, which ends up calling `_getMaturedValue`, which [will revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L23) if the account is not settled yet.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add to `withdraw`: ``` NotionalV2.settleAccount(address(this)); ``` This will ensure that the account is settled and `withdraw` will not revert.
