# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/Kernel.sol#L325   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are no checks to ascertain that the policy being removed is registered in the `Kernel`. Trying to remove a non-registered results in the policy registered at 0th index of `activePolicies` being removed.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/Kernel.sol#L325  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Adding `require(activePolicies[idx] == policy_, "Unregistered policy");` will prevent this, where `idx = getPolicyIndex[policy_]`.  **NOTE:** The issue is less likely to happen as this is handled solely by the executor, but having safeguards in the contract is always better than relying on an external factor.
