# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Inability to set a sensible range which covers all borrow assets without being overly wide.  ## Proof of Concept  `PoolFactory` has a set requirement that created pool must ask to borrow an amount of assets which are within a certain range as encoded in the `poolSizeLimit`.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/PoolFactory.sol#L286  This doesn't take into account the relative values of each borrow asset so it's hard to choose a one-size-fits-all value for these limits (A 100 WBTC loan could be sensible but a 100 USDC loan will be dwarfs by the gas costs to deploy the pool.)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Place limits on the USD value of the borrowed amount as reported by the factory's price oracle.
