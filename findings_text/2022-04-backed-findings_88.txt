The attacker can set bad values of `lendInfo` (e.g. very long duration, and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout don't expect.  ## Proof of Concept  An attacker lends a loan, and `loanAssetContractAddress` in `loanInfo` is ERC777 which is suffering from reentrancy attack. When a lender (victim) try to buyout the loan of the attacker:  1. The victim called `lend()`. 2. In `lend()`, it always call `ERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransfer` to send `accumulatedInterest + previousLoanAmount` to `currentLoanOwner` (attacker). 3. The `transfer` of `loanAssetContractAddress` ERC777 will call `_callTokensReceived` so that the attacker can call `lend()` again in reentrancy with parameters:     * loanId: same loan Id     * interestRate: set to bad value (e.g. 0)     * amount: same amount     * durationSeconds: set to bad value (e.g. a long durationSeconds)     * sendLendTicketTo: same address of the attacker (`currentLoanOwner`) 4. Now the variables in `loanInfo` are changed to bad value, and the victim will get the lend ticket but the loan term is manipulated, and can not set it back (because it requires a better term).  ## Tools Used  vim  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use `nonReentrant` modifier on `lend()` to prevent reentrancy attack:  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol
