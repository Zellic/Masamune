Consequences: A borrower who requests a loan with a malicious oracle can avoid legitimate liquidation.  ## Proof of Concept  - Borrower requests loan with an malicious oracle - Lender accepts loan unknowingly - Borrowers's bad oracle is set to never return a liquidating rate on `oracle.get` call. - Lender cannot call `removeCollateral` to liquidate the NFT when it should be allowed, as it will fail the check on [L288](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-abranft/blob/5cd4edc3298c05748e952f8a8c93e42f930a78c2/contracts/NFTPairWithOracle.sol#L288) - To liquidate the NFT, the lender would have to whitehat along the lines of H-01, by atomically updating to an honest oracle and calling `removeCollateral`.  ## Mitigations  - Add `require(params.oracle == accepted.oracle)` as a condition in `_lend` - Consider only allowing whitelisted oracles, to avoid injection of malicious oracles at the initial loan request stage
