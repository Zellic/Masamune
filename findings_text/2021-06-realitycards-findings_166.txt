# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The variable `domainSeperator` in `EIP712Base` is cached in the contract storage and will not change after the contract is initialized. However, if a hard fork happens after the contract deployment, the `domainSeperator` would become invalid on one of the forked chains due to the `block.chainid` has changed.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [EIP712Base.sol#L25-L44](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/lib/EIP712Base.sol#L25-L44)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using the [implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol) from OpenZeppelin, which recalculates the domain separator if the current `block.chainid` is not the cached chain ID.
