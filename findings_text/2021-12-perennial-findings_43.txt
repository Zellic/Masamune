# Handle  ye0lde   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Transfer amount can be checked for > 0 before calling `push' which makes a call to `safeTransfer`. This can save gas by avoiding the external call.  ## Proof of Concept  The transfer is here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L237-L238   ## Tools Used Visual Studio Code, Remix  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check that transfer amount > 0 before L#237-238 are executed.  Consider checking for `amount` > 0 in these functions: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/utils/types/Token18.sol#L51 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/utils/types/Token18.sol#L68 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/utils/types/Token18.sol#L85
