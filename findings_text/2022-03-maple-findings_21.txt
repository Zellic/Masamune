# QA Report  ## Non-Critical Findings  ### Redundant type cast to `address`  #### Description  Variable `asset` is defined as `address public override asset`, the type casting to `address` is redundant.  #### Findings  [RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L162](https://github.com/maple-labs/revenue-distribution-token/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L162)   [RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L181](https://github.com/maple-labs/revenue-distribution-token/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L181)  #### Recommended mitigation steps  Remove redundant type cast.  From:  ```solidity require(ERC20Helper.transfer(address(asset), receiver_, assets_), "RDT:B:TRANSFER"); ```  To:  ```solidity require(ERC20Helper.transfer(asset, receiver_, assets_), "RDT:B:TRANSFER"); ```  ---  ### Open TODOs in code  #### Description  Open TODOs can hint at programming or architectural errors that still need to be fixed.  #### Findings  [RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L78](https://github.com/maple-labs/revenue-distribution-token/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L78)   [RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L276](https://github.com/maple-labs/revenue-distribution-token/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/RevenueDistributionToken.sol#L276)    #### Recommended mitigation steps  Implement open TODOs and remove comments.  ### `xMPL.performMigration()` is safe to be called by everyone  #### Description  `xMPL.performMigration()` is currently only allowed to be called by the contract owner, but as there are no funds at risk and no downsides to having everyone (public) call the function, the modifier `onlyOwner` can be removed.  It even states so in the [README](https://github.com/maple-labs/xMPL/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/README.md):  ``` 3. After the time delay, anyone can call `performMigration`, which executes the migration with the parameters set 10 days prior. ```  #### Findings  [xMPL.performMigration()](https://github.com/maple-labs/xMPL/blob/v1.0.0-beta.1/contracts/xMPL.sol#L51)  #### Recommended mitigation steps  Remove modifier `onlyOwner`.  ## Low Risk  None found.
