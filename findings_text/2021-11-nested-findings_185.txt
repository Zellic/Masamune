# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The use of _msgSender() when there is no implementation of a meta transaction mechanism that uses it, such as EIP-2771, very slightly increases gas consumption.   ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following contracts.  "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L135" "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L111" "https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/5d113967cdf7c9ee29802e1ecb176c656386fe9b/contracts/NestedReserve.sol#L32"  ## Tools Used  Code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Replace _msgSender() with msg.sender if there is no mechanism to support meta-transactions like EIP-2771 implemented.
