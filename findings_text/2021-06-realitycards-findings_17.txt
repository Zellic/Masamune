# Handle  heiho1   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  RCMarket#initialize(uint256,uint32[],uint256,uint256,address,address,address[],address,string) has a potentially expensive loop that modifies state continually over an indeterminate number of cards.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L252  ## Tools Used  Slither  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Potentially a gas-expensive loop because of arbitrary length of _cardAffiliateAddresses possibly assigning to state variable cardAffiliateCut multiple times. * It appears that the loop may be exited on the first cardAffiliateCut = 0 to optimize gas * Alternatively a local variable may be assigned temporarily and then assigned to state: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#costly-operations-inside-a-loop
