# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  `newParamProposal()` takes in a `uint32 param` as an input argument. The valid scenarios for this proposal are for changing the cooloff period and erasToEarn via the `changeCooloff()` and `changeEras()`. These functions however cast the `param` to `uint256` before assigning it to the relevant variable.   We therefore have either of the following cases:  1.  `uint32 param` should be increased to `uint256 param` 2. `coolOffPeriod` and `erasToEarn` can be decreased in size to `uint32` instead of `uint256`. For further optimizations, these 2 variables should be grouped together so that they take up 1 storage slot instead of 2 separate ones.
