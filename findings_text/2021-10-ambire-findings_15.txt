# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In the function setAddrPrivilege of Identity.sol the value of privileges[addr] is compare to 0 and 1 in the following way: "if (privileges[addr] != bytes32(0) && privileges[addr] != bytes32(uint(1)))"  As 0 and 1 are adjacent, you could also check "uint(privileges[addr]) > 1". This saves a (small amount) of gas.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/Identity.sol#L59  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps replace if (privileges[addr] != bytes32(0) && privileges[addr] != bytes32(uint(1))) ... with if (uint(privileges[addr]) > 1) ...
