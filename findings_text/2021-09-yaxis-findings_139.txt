# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact `NativeStrategyCurve3Crv._harvest` calls `getMostPremium` to get the best stablecoin to convert to. This function however is wrong in the case of `balancesUSDC = balancesUSDT < balancesDAI`, because it returns DAI, when it should be USDC or USDT. This is naturally a rare occasion, but a bad actor can set the balances (by depositing/withdrawing the Curve pool) like this just before the harvest function is called. Since this would imbalance even more the pool, the bad actor could also gain a profit by making the right swaps after the harvest.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/strategies/NativeStrategyCurve3Crv.sol#L83  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Convert all `<` into `<=` inside `getMostPremium()`.
