# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function getMarketInfo of RCFactory only can give results back in the range 0...marketInfoResults  Supplying _skipResults doesn't help, it then just skips the first _skipResults  records.  Assume marketInfoResults == 10 and _skipResults == 20: Then no result will be given back because "_resultNumber < marketInfoResults" will never allow _resultNumber  to be bigger than 10  Note: this is low risk because getMarketInfo is a backup function (although you maybe want the backup to function as expected)  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCFactory.sol#L227   function getMarketInfo( IRCMarket.Mode _mode, uint256 _state, uint256 _skipResults  )  external view         returns ( address[] memory, string[] memory, string[] memory, uint256[] memory ) {            ..         uint256 _resultNumber = 0;        ..         while (_resultNumber < marketInfoResults && _marketIndex > 1) {            ...                 if (_resultNumber < _skipResults) {                     _resultNumber++;                 } else {                     _marketAddresses[_resultNumber] = _market;   // will never reach this part if _skipResults >= marketInfoResults                      ....                     _resultNumber++;                 }             }         }         return (_marketAddresses, _ipfsHashes, _slugs, _potSizes);     }   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Update the code to something like the following:       uint idx;  while (idx < marketInfoResults && _marketIndex > 1) {             _marketIndex--;             address _market = marketAddresses[_mode][_marketIndex];             if (IRCMarket(_market).state() == IRCMarket.States(_state)) {                 if (_resultNumber < _skipResults) {                     _resultNumber++;                 } else {                     _marketAddresses[idx] = _market;                     _ipfsHashes[idx] = ipfsHash[_market];                     _slugs[idx] = addressToSlug[_market];                     _potSizes[idx] = IRCMarket(_market).totalRentCollected();                     idx++;                 }             }         }
