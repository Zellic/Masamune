# Handle  paulius.eth   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability details  Every loan has its own fundingPeriod which is set once in the constructor: fundingPeriod          = globals.fundingPeriod(); fundingPeriod in globals can change. It does not effect already deployed Loans. However, in Loan contract function unwind() calls LoanLib.unwind which checks against globals.fundingPeriod():         IGlobals globals = _globals(superFactory);         // Only callable if time has passed drawdown grace period, set in MapleGlobals         require(block.timestamp > createdAt.add(globals.fundingPeriod()), "Loan:FUNDING_PERIOD_NOT_FINISHED"); at this time, globals.fundingPeriod() could be different than this specific Loan's fundingPeriod.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Check expiration against local fundingPeriod.
