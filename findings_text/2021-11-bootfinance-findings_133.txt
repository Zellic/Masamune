# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas optimization  ## Proof of Concept  On Swap.sol at L190 and L191, it is checked that whether _a and _a2 is bigger equal to 0. Since they are both uint256, this condition is always satisfied. Therefore, those conditions are not required.  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis
