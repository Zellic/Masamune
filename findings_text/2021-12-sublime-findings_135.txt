# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The strategy contracts define an `unlockShares` function that must accept an `asset` parameter as the **share** token (yield token, aToken, cToken, etc.), otherwise, the code does not work. However, all comments say that `asset` is the address of the **underlying token**.  ```solidity /**   * @notice Used to unlock shares   * @param asset the address of underlying token   * @param amount the amount of shares to unlock   * @return received amount of shares received   **/ function unlockShares(address asset, uint256 amount) external override onlySavingsAccount nonReentrant returns (uint256) {     if (amount == 0) {         return 0;     } } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Fix the comments for all `unlockShares` by saying `asset` is the share token, not the underlying token.
