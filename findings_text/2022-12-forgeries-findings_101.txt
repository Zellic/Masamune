For example: - `keyHash` is not validated within `coordinator.requestRandomWords()`. Providing an invalid `keyHash` will allow the raffle to start but prevent the oracle from actually supplying a random value to determine the raffle result.     - https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/00f9c6e41f843f96108cdaa118a6ca740b11df35/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L407-L409     - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L163 - The admin/owner could alternatively ensure that the owner-provided chain.link VRF subscription does not have sufficient funds to pay at the time the oracle attempts to supply random values in `fulfillRandomWords()`.     - https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/00f9c6e41f843f96108cdaa118a6ca740b11df35/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L594-L596  In addition, the owner/admin could simply avoid ever calling `startDraw()` in the first place.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Depending on the desired functionality with respect to the raffle owner, a successful callback to `fulfillRandomWords()` could be a precondition of the admin/owner reclaiming the reward NFT. This would help ensure the owner does not create raffles that they intend will never pay out a reward.
