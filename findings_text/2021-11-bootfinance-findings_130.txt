# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Suppose you are eligible for the last part of your airdrop (or your entire airdrop if you haven't claimed anything yet). Then you call the function claim() of AirdropDistribution.sol, which has the following statement: "assert(airdrop[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);" This statement will prevent you from claiming your airdrop because it will stop execution.  Note: with the function claimExact() it is possible to claim the last part.  ## Proof of Concept // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L522-L536  function claim() external nonReentrant {        ..         assert(airdrop[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);         airdrop[msg.sender].amount -= claimable;  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the assert statement. Also add the following to validate() , to prevent claiming the airdrop again:       require(validated[msg.sender]== 0, "Already validated.");
