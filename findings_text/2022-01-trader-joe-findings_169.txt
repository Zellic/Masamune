# Handle  kirk-baird   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The function [allowEmergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L520) may be called by the `rocketJoeFactory.owner()` at any time. If it is called while the protocol is in Stage 3 and a pair has been created then the LP tokens will be locked and both issues and depositors will be unable to withdraw.  ## Proof of Concept  If `allowEmergencyWithdraw()`  is called `stopped` is set to `true`. As a result functions [withdrawIncentives()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L468) and [withdrawLiquidity()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L438) will revert due to the `isStopped(false)` modifier reverting.  Additionally, [emergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L494) will revert since all the `WAVAX` and `token` balances have been transferred to the liquidity pool.  Thus, depositors and issuers will have no methods of removing their LP tokens or incentives.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding the requirement `require(address(pair) != address(0), "LaunchEvent: pair not created");` to the function `allowEmergencyWithdraw()`.
