Therefore, this array element should be cached in a local variable and then be loaded  again using this local variable, skipping the redundent second array boundaries check:           ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, variable name: _accounts times: 5 at: _calcRewardIntegral         ConvexStakingWrapper.sol, variable name: _accounts times: 5 at: _calcCvxIntegral
