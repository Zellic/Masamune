# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `FYToken.constructor` performs an external call to `IERC20Metadata(address(IJoin(join_).asset())).decimals()`. This function was optional in the initial ERC-20 and might fail for old tokens that therefore did not implement it.  ## Impact FyTokens cannot be created for tokens that implemented the old initial ERC20 without the `decimals` function.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider using the helper function in the utils to retrieve it `SafeERC20Namer.tokenDecimals`, the same way the `Pool.constructor` works.
