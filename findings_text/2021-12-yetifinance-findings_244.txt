# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact ecrecover returns an empty address when the signature is invalid. As far as I checked, with the current codebase, there is no way to exploit it to gain any benefits, but it is a good practice to check against that. ```solidity   address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);   require(recoveredAddress == owner, 'YUSD: invalid signature'); ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps require recoveredAddress != address(0)  You could also consider using OZ's ECDSA library for signature verifications: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol
