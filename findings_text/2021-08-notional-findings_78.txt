# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details The `TokenHandler.transfer` should handle the `if (token.tokenType == TokenType.Ether)` case first, as if the token type is `Ether` but `netTransferExternal <= 0` it treats the token as an `ERC20` token and tries to call `ERC20` functions on it.   ## Impact Luckily, trying to call ERC20 functions on the invalid token address will revert which is the desired behavior.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps We still recommend reordering the branches and adding a `netTransferExternal <= 0` check. The code becomes cleaner and it's more obvious that the transaction will fail.
