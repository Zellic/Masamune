# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are TODOs left in the code. While this does not cause any direct issue, it indicates a bad smell and uncertainty. In previous reports, such submissions were assigned a score of 'low' so I think it's a fair game to submit this as an issue here also.  Reference: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/67 https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tempus-findings/issues/39  Also, there are some misleading comments, e.g.: ```solidity     /// @notice Internal update function to price, cap, and pay funding.     function update () public virtual returns ( ``` the comment says that function is internal but it is actually declared as public.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider implementing or removing TODOs and updating misleading comments.
