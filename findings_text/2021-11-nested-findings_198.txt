# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Whenever condition of the ```_handleUnderSpending``` function fails function call gas costs are wasted. The cost of checking the condition is paid anyway, while when it doesn't hold the function call costs are avoidable.  ## Proof of Concept  ```_handleUnderSpending``` checks for ```_amountToSpent - _amountSpent > 0```.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L481  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  When the check condition is false ```_handleUnderSpending``` shouldn't be called and this way the check with corresponding variables to be placed in caller functions:  _submitInOrders https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L306  _safeSubmitOrder https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L415
