# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   Due to how the EVM natively works on 256 bit numbers, using a 8 bit number in for-loops introduces additional costs as the EVM has to properly enforce the limits of this smaller type.  See the warning at this link: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage : > When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size. > It is only beneficial to use reduced-size arguments if you are dealing with storage values because the compiler will pack multiple elements into one storage slot, and thus, combine multiple reads or writes into a single operation. When dealing with function arguments or memory values, there is no inherent benefit because the compiler does not pack these values.    ## Proof of Concept   ``` Vault.sol:109:        for (uint128 i = 0; i < 2; i++) { ```  ## Tools Used   VS Code      ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Use `uint256` as a counter in for-loops.
