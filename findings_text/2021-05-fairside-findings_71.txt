# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas optimization is possible for the current `rootPows` implementation.  ## Proof of Concept  The original implementation of `rootPows` requires 4 `mul` and 2 `sqrt`:  ```solidity function rootPows(bytes16 x) private pure returns (bytes16, bytes16) {     // fourth root     x = x.sqrt().sqrt();     // to the power of 3     x = _pow3(x);     // we offset the root on the second arg     return (x, x.mul(x)); } ```  However, the calculation process can be simplified to be more gas-efficient than the original with only 1 `mul` and 2 `sqrt` requried:  ```solidity function rootPows(bytes16 x) private pure returns (bytes16, bytes16) {     bytes16 x1_2 = x.sqrt();     bytes16 x3_2 = x.mul(x1_2);     bytes16 x3_4 = x3_2.sqrt();     return (x3_4, x3_2); } ```  Referenced code: [FairSideFormula.sol#L67-L75](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside/blob/main/contracts/dependencies/FairSideFormula.sol#L67-L75)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  To save gas, change the implementation of `rootPows` as mentioned above.
