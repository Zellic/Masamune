The address could frontrun the `updateAddress` call and spend their entire buffer, then the buffer is replenished and they can spend their entire buffer a second time.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Keep the old buffer value, capped by the new `bufferCap`:  ```diff + uint256 newBuffer = individualBuffer(rateLimitedAddress);    rateLimitData.lastBufferUsedTime = block.timestamp.toUint32();   rateLimitData.bufferCap = _bufferCap;   rateLimitData.rateLimitPerSecond = _rateLimitPerSecond; - rateLimitData.bufferStored = _bufferCap; + rateLimitData.bufferStored = min(_bufferCap, newBuffer); ```
