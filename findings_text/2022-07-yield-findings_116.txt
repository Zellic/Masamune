Cause errors for liquidators to run normally.  ## Proof of Concept In the function `auction`, there is on input validation around whether the `to` is `address(0)` or not. and if the `auctioneerReward` is set to an value > 0 (as default),  each liquidate call will call `Join` module to pay out to `auctioneer` with the following line:  ```jsx if (auctioneerCut > 0) {     ilkJoin.exit(auction_.auctioneer, auctioneerCut.u128()); } ```  This line will revert if `auctioneer` is set to `address(0)` on some tokens (revert on transferring to address(0) is a [default behaviour of the OpenZeppelin template](https://www.notion.so/Yield-Witch-555e6981c26b41008d03a504077b4770)). So if someone start an `auction` with `to = address(0)`, this auction becomes un-liquidatable.  A malicious user can run a bot to monitor his own vault, and if the got underwater and they don’t have enough collateral to top up, they can immediately start an auction on their own vault and set actioneer to `0` to avoid actually being liquidated, which breaks the design of the system.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add check while starting an auction:  ```jsx function auction(bytes12 vaultId, address to)     external     returns (DataTypes.Auction memory auction_) {     require (to != address(0), "invalid auctioneer");   ... }   ```
