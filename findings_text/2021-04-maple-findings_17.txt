# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  LoanLib.sol has a definition of enum State and Loan.sol has the same definition. The LoanLib.sol does not seem to be used This means dead code and could be confusing.  ## Proof of Concept  Loan.sol:       enum State { Ready, Active, Matured, Expired, Liquidated } LoanLib.sol:    enum State { Ready, Active, Matured, Expired, Liquidated }  ## Tools Used  grep "enum" *.sol -S  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the unused definition from LoanLib.sol (or make sure there is just one definition for the enum and include that elsewhere)
