# Handle  defsec   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  From Pragma 0.8.0, ABI coder v2 is activated by default. The pragma abicoder v2 can be deleted from the repository. That will provide gas optimization.  ## Proof of Concept  1. Navigate to the following code sections.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-slingshot/blob/main/contracts/Adminable.sol#L3  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-slingshot/blob/main/contracts/ApprovalHandler.sol#L3  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-slingshot/blob/main/contracts/Executioner.sol#L3  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-slingshot/blob/main/contracts/Slingshot.sol#L3  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ABI coder v2 is activated by default. It is recommended to delete redundant codes.   From Solidity v0.8.0 Breaking Changes https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/080-breaking-changes.html
