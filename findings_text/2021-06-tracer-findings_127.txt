# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In LibBalances.applyTrade() we need to collect a fee from the trade. The current code however subtracts a fee from the short position and adds it to the long. The correct implementation is to subtract a fee to both (see TracerPerpetualSwaps.sol#L272). This issue causes withdrawals problems, since Tracer thinks it can withdraw the collect fees, leaving the users with an incorrect amount of quote tokens.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibBalances.sol#L187  ## Tools Used Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change +fee to -fee in the highlighted line.
