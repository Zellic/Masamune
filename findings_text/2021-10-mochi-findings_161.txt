# Handle  leastwood   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `withdrawLock()` does not prevent users from calling this function when locking has been toggled. As a result, withdraws may be made unexpectedly.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/treasury/MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L40-L42  ## Tools Used  Manual code review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider adding `require(lockCrv, "!lock");` to `withdrawLock()` to ensure this function is not called unexpectedly. Alternatively if this is intended behaviour, it should be rather checked that the lock has not been toggled, otherwise users could maliciously relock tokens.
