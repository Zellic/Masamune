# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `transferFromFactory()` function is missing the `valid(address(_token))` modifier that is present in the `transfer()` and `withdraw()` functions.  It is in our opinion that these sanity checks on the token address are redundant, because the transaction will revert anyway in the SafeERC20 library.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Either add in the modifier check for the `transferFromFactory()` function. Alternatively, remove them from all the functions as a gas optimization.
