# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The DAO codebase not handle deflationary asset tokens. However, this is handled in similar _handleTransferIn functions of Router and poolFactory which indicates that protocol allows/anticipates listing of deflationary tokens which require a start balance check/subtraction before and after transfers to account for the actual amount transferred instead of taking the face-value amount from the parameter without considering any transfer fees imposed by the token contract.  Rationale for Medium severity: This is typically a low-severity finding in protocols that uniformly do not handle deflationary/inflationary/rebasing tokens because they either whitelist-away such tokens or do not anticipate handling them (by documenting and warning users) in their protocols. Spartan however has code indicative of expecting/handling deflationary tokens in Router and poolFactory but is missing similar special handling in DAO which is a case of missed handling and so is more serious because it leads to mis-accounting and potential fund loss in different parts of the protocol code.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Dao.sol#L266  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Router.sol#L206-L208  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/poolFactory.sol#L111-L113  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add code similar to Router and poolFactory to handle deflationary tokens in DAO.
