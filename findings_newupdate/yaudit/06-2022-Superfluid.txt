18. Unchecked counter incrementation in "for" loop Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
19. Potential underflow condition Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
20. Potential hash collision Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
21. Logic inconsistency between callAgreementWithContext() and callAppActionWithContext() Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
22. Upgradable Superfluid.sol has hardcoded version Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
23. _callAppAction() logic varies from _callAgreement() Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
24. Use named cached variable Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
25. _replacePlaceholderCtx() logic could be simplified Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
26. _callCallback() logic can be simplified Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
27. Broken link Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
28. FIXME or TODO comments remain in code Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
29. Typos Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
30. Incorrect external code reference Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
31. Match callInfo masks and shifts to data size Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
32. isConfigWordClean doesn't check some unused bits Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
33. Remove unnecessary casting to ISuperApp type Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
34. Incorrect comments Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
35. Variation in isTrustedForwarder() implementations Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: 
36. Implementation contracts not initialized Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: Superfluid, SuperfluidAgreement, SuperTokenFactory are deployed as UUPS proxy contracts. Anyone call their initialize() function as implementation contracts are not initialized. 
37. Possible to register multiple apps with same registrationKey Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: Governance's owner can call setConfig() to allow an address a (hashed into key) to register a SuperApp with Superfluid.sol (host). The value parameter is the timestamp until which the address can register the app. a can initiate a transaction to register multiple apps through registerAppWithKey() as long as block.timestamp <= value. 
38. Valid context is not checked before modifying it Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: For reference, appCallbackPush() has asserts a valid context through assertValidCtx(ctx). There is no such verification for appCallbackPop().
