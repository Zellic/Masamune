1. staking.unstake() should set rebasing bool to true Severity: High Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: The steps that the YieldStreamer functions take to withdraw yield to stream tokens occur in this order Calculate yield in gOHM Unwrap gOHM to sOHM Unstake sOHM to OHM Convert OHM to stream token The problem is in step 3. The rebasing bool is set to false, which will cause the staking contract to take gOHM from msg.sender instead of taking sOHM as the YieldStreamer contract requires. The logic for the rebasing boolean in the staking contract is if (_rebasing) { sOHM.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount); amount_ = amount_.add(bounty); } else { gOHM.burn(msg.sender, _amount); // amount was given in gOHM terms amount_ = gOHM.balanceFrom(amount_).add(bounty); // convert amount to OHM terms & add bounty } In order to convert sOHM to OHM in the staking.unstake() function, which is required in step 3 of the steps outlined above, the rebasing parameter must be set to true. Otherwise gOHM will be converted instead. https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/Staking.sol#L181 Currently the rebasing boolean value is set to false in two locations https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L246 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L322 
2. Sandwich attack risk in YieldStreamer.sol Severity: High Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: This code is how the swap is performed in YieldStreamer.sol in two locations: https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L248-L255 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L324-L331 uint256[] memory calculatedAmounts = sushiRouter.getAmountsOut(totalOhmToSwap, sushiRouterPath); uint256[] memory amounts = sushiRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens( totalOhmToSwap, (calculatedAmounts[1] * (1000000 - maxSwapSlippagePercent)) / 1000000, sushiRouterPath, msg.sender, block.timestamp ); The amountOutMin value is the output of getAmountsOut(totalOhmToSwap, sushiRouterPath) minus some slippage percent maxSwapSlippagePercent. Examining the code of the swapExactTokensForTokens() function, we can see how amountOutMin is used. There is a check to confirm the result of the exchange is greater than the amountOutMin https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/56cedd0e06a6cf665083b3a662f9f77b80303ebe/contracts/uniswapv2/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L233 amounts = UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path); require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT'); But because the swapExactTokensForTokens() function is using the exact same getAmountsOut() function that was used in YieldStreamer.sol to calculate amountOutMin and is calculated in the same transaction, the result is that the two getAmountsOut() output values will always be equal. So the amountOutMin set in YieldStreamer.sol serves no purpose because it can never yield a result where the amountOutMin value reverts the swap, because amountOutMin is getAmountsOut() minus some slippage, which will always be less than or equal to getAmountsOut(). The current calculation to provide an amountOutMin value is a waste of gas. Even in a scenario where a private relay is used, miners cannot guarantee that a block will not become an uncle block. If the block is uncled, the mempool data becomes public and an uncle bandit attack is possible. 
3. Denial of service in upkeep "for" loop in YieldStreamer.sol Severity: Medium Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: This code is how the swap is performed in YieldStreamer.sol in two locations: https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L248-L255 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L324-L331 uint256[] memory calculatedAmounts = sushiRouter.getAmountsOut(totalOhmToSwap, sushiRouterPath); uint256[] memory amounts = sushiRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens( totalOhmToSwap, (calculatedAmounts[1] * (1000000 - maxSwapSlippagePercent)) / 1000000, sushiRouterPath, msg.sender, block.timestamp ); The amountOutMin value is the output of getAmountsOut(totalOhmToSwap, sushiRouterPath) minus some slippage percent maxSwapSlippagePercent.

There is a check to confirm the result of the exchange is greater than the amountOutMin https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/56cedd0e06a6cf665083b3a662f9f77b80303ebe/contracts/uniswapv2/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L233 amounts = UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path); require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT'); But because the swapExactTokensForTokens() function is using the exact same getAmountsOut() function that was used in YieldStreamer.sol to calculate amountOutMin and is calculated in the same transaction, the result is that the two getAmountsOut() output values will always be equal.

4. donatedTo and depositsTo only return the first of N possible donation or deposit mappings Severity: Low Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/main/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L195 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/main/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L256 
5. _redeemAll() does not delete recipientLookup Severity: Low Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: In the _redeem() function, receiptIds.pop(); and delete recipientLookup[depositId_] are called https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L429-L455 But in the similar _redeemAll() function, there is no delete recipientLookup[depositId_]; call. https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L460-L488 
6. Declare function external for gas savings Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L315 
7. Use == for gas savings Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: <= is used instead of == in three modifiers https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L71-L81 >= can be simplified to < by flipping the if/else clauses in two locations https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L415 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L163 An example of flipping the if/else clauses is shown. Here is the original code: if (amount_ >= _toAgnostic(depositInfo[depositId_].principalAmount)) { amountWithdrawn = _withdrawAllPrincipal(depositId_, msg.sender); } else { _withdrawPrincipal(depositId_, amount_, msg.sender); amountWithdrawn = amount_; } And here is the modified code with a minor gas savings. This specific gas savings may be negated if the _withdrawAllPrincipal clause is used most of the time: if (amount_ < _toAgnostic(depositInfo[depositId_].principalAmount)) { _withdrawPrincipal(depositId_, amount_, msg.sender); amountWithdrawn = amount_; } else { amountWithdrawn = _withdrawAllPrincipal(depositId_, msg.sender); }

10. Remove functions to save gas on deployment Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: balanceTo and balanceFrom in gOHM.sol convert between sOHM and gOHM using the current index exchange rate https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/governance/gOHM.sol#L111-L127 The YieldSplitter.sol functions _fromAgnostic and _toAgnostic duplicate this functionality https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/types/YieldSplitter.sol#L170-L186

12. Gas savings with memory variable Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: The _closeDeposit() function in YieldSplitter.sol uses the value "depositInfo[id_].depositor" twice https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/types/YieldSplitter.sol#L144 The _redeemAll() in YieldDirector.sol function uses the value "depositInfo[receiptIds[index - 1]].depositor" twice https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldDirector.sol#L460

14. Miscellaneous Improvement Ideas Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: Examples of overlap between YieldDirector.sol and YieldStreamer.sol include: YieldDirector.sol has modifiers isInvalidDeposit, isInvalidUpdate, and isInvalidWithdrawal, but YieldStreamer.sol only checks the boolean value depositDisabled, withdrawDisabled, or upkeepDisabled. YieldStreamer.sol may benefit from the same modifiers used in YieldDirector.sol. Functions like desposit() and addToDeposit() perform almost identical actions but have different names for input parameters and different natspec comments. These could be standardized better across the two contracts. Examples of magic numbers that should be converted to constant variables are found in several places: https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L436 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L445 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L251 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L318 https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/f92425ff278b93cfc2a580299924417182da432a/contracts/peripheral/YieldStreamer.sol#L327
