A1 Optimization suggestions STATUS INFO In the RelayEncoder.sol contract the function encode_withdraw_unbonded() uses several arithmetic operations with numbers that can be expressed as powers of 2. Thus, the multiplications and the divisions can be replaced with bitwise operations for more eiciency and maintainability. Furthermore, in Encoding.sol::scaleCompactUint:45 the 0xFF can be removed since the uint8() casting will give the same result even without the AND operation. 
A2 Tests for minor changes ACKNOWLEDGED The auditors appreciated the inclusion of tests for all major changes. It would be benecial to include tests also for smaller changes that seem to be missing (for instance we could not nd a test for the case totalXcKSMPoolShares == 0 and totalVirtualXcKSMAmount != 0). Although this check is minor, the fact that it was missing in the previous version makes it worthy of a test. A3 Compiler known issues INFO The code is compiled with Solidity 0.8.0 or higher. For deployment, we recommend no floating pragmas, i.e., a specic version, to be condent about the baseline guarantees 4 oered by the compiler. Version 0.8.0, in particular, has some known bugs, which we do not believe aect the correctness of the contracts
