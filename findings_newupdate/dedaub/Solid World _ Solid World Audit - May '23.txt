A1 SolidStakings Stake event does not capture the msg.sender WONT FIX The SolidStaking Stake event captures the recipient account but not the msg.sender, thus this piece of information is not recorded if the recipient is not also the msg.sender. A2 LiquidityDeployer::getTokenDepositors can be optimized to save gas WONT FIX The function LiquidityDeployer::getTokenDepositors copies the depositors array from storage to memory by performing a loop over each element of the array instead of just returning the array. LiquidityDeployer::getTokenDepositors function getTokenDepositors() external view returns (address[] memory tokenDepositors) { } tokenDepositors = new address[](depositors.tokenDepositors.length); for (uint i; i < depositors.tokenDepositors.length; i++) { tokenDepositors[i] = depositors.tokenDepositors[i]; } By changing the code to:  function getTokenDepositors() external view returns (address[] memory tokenDepositors) { } return depositors.tokenDepositors; the cost of calling getTokenDepositors is reduced by 33% and the deployment cost of the LiquidityDeployer is reduced by ~1.5%.
