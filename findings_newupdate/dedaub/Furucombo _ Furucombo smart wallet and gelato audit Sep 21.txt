L1 Proliferous use of weak blacklists Furucombo Gelato makes use of a number of blacklists including: - Who can create a new task - What task can be created It is however trivial for any user to get around this blacklisting style. For instance, in the case of a task, one can simply add some additional calldata which does not aect the semantics of the task. Therefore, if there is a reason to blacklist users or tasks, a stronger mechanism needs to be designed. L2 delegateCallOnly methods not properly guarded in Actions CLOSED In TaskExecutor the delegateCallOnly() modier is dened to ensure that the batchExec() method is only called via delegate call, as intended by the deployers. This can be reused by the other Actions as well, to make sure that they are not misused. 0 OTHER/ ADVISORY ISSUES: This section details issues that are not thought to directly aect the functionality of the project, but we recommend addressing them. ID Description 
A1 Floating pragma STATUS CLOSED The floating pragma pragma solidity ^0.6.0; is used in most contracts, allowing them to be compiled with the 0.6.0 - 0.6.12 versions of the Solidity compiler. Although the dierences between these versions are small, floating pragmas should be avoided and the pragma should be xed to the version that will be used for the contracts deployment. A2 Compiler known issues INFO The contracts were compiled with the Solidity compiler 0.6.12 which, at the time of writing, has multiple issues related to memory arrays. Since furrucombo-smart-wallet makes heavy use of memory arrays, and sending and receiving these to third party contracts, it is worth considering switching to a newer version of the Solidity compiler. 0
