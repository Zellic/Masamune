[N05] Inconsistencies around time  While much of the codebase uses timestamps to measure time, some time intervals are measured instead as a number of blocks. In these instances, comments are used to indicate the time interval desired that led to the specified number of blocks, however, these comments use inconsistent methods of estimation.  For instance, in GovernorAlpha the votingPeriod value, 17280, is accompanied by inline documentation that assumes 15-second block times. In CoreOrchestrator, the INCENTIVE_GROWTH_RATE value has inline documentation that assumes 12-second block times. The whitepaper and other project documentation generally match this inline documentation.  Even when a number of blocks is converted to a time interval using a consistent block time assumption, those approximations can deviate from reality. Inconsistent block time assumptions only make things more confusing. Block times can and will be variable, and the actual current block times of the Ethereum network have been closer to ~13s. This means that the actual time intervals observed in production could deviate from the documentation by as much as 13%. For example, the votingPeriod value is documented as being equivalent to approximately three days, when, in reality, it would be closer to two days and fourteen hours  a significant deviation that could result in user confusion.  To reduce confusion and increase the predictability of time intervals, consider using block timestamps for time intervals where possible. Alternatively, document assumptions about block times clearly and consistently, and be sure to explicitly reflect the variability of the time intervals they represent.  Update: Fixed in PR#50. Now, block times are assumed to be of ~13s.  [N06] Inconsistent coding style  There are general inconsistencies and some deviations from the Solidity Style Guide throughout the codebase. Below is a non-exhaustive list of inconsistent coding styles observed.  While most public function names do not contain an underscore, some begin with one underscore and others begin with two underscores. For example:  The _feiTribeExchangeRate function  The __acceptAdmin function  The __abdicate function  Some internal function names start with an underscore, while others do not. For example:  _writeCheckpoint and safe32 are both internal functions in the Tribe contract.  _setBeneficiary and setLockedToken are both internal functions in the LinearTokenTimelock contract.

We looked at the code and now publish our results.  Scope  We audited commit 29aeefddd97f31c7f2a598fb3dca3ef24dc0beb4 of the fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core repository. In scope were the contracts directly inside the /contracts folder, however the contracts within /contract/mocks were out of scope. Note: the repository in question is private at the time of writing, so many hyperlinks will only work for the  team.  System overview   Protocol is the first protocol creating a stablecoin using a new stability mechanism called direct incentives. This stablecoin, named FEI, is not fully collateralized, but instead uses a system of incentives to encourage trading activity that brings the token back to its USD peg. This is achieved by attaching incentives to trades through an ETH/FEI Uniswap Pair, that mint or burn FEI tokens in certain situations.  The protocol uses a bonding curve to price FEI, implements a Protocol Controlled Value to enable the incentive design, and has a governance token called TRIBE to allow user-controlled upgrades to the system  Below we summarize some of the key aspects of the  Protocol.  Protocol Controlled Value  In many DeFi applications, all of the funds deposited within the protocol actually belong to a user, and the user is minted tokens to represent the amount that the protocol owes them. Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) instead is money that the protocol owns outright  that is not owed to a user. This value is what allows the protocol to provide incentives and influence market conditions. The protocols bonding curve is what allows the protocol to calculate and accrue PCV.  Genesis Period  The Genesis period is 3 days in which a contract known as the GenesisGroup collects the ETH needed to bootstrap the protocol. During this time, any user can deposit ETH into the contract, and receive FGEN tokens in return. These tokens entitle the user to an amount of FEI and TRIBE tokens as a reward after launch. Users contributing to the Genesis are guaranteed that they will receive FEI at a maximum price of $0.90, which should then be pegged to $1 after launch and after a thawing period.  The Genesis period ends after 3 days, or earlier if the protocol collects enough ETH. The contract will then add liquidity to the FEI/TRIBE and ETH/FEI Uniswap pools, initialize the bonding curve oracle, and deposit rewards back into the GenesisGroup contracts for contributors to collect.   Reward pool  Incentive contracts  Privileged roles  The admin will be able to:  Add and revoke roles,  Perform emergency reweights to restore the FEI peg,  Modify the scale, buffer, and allocations of the bonding curve,  Change the address of the FEI token,  Transfer/allocate unallocated TRIBE tokens,  Flip the kill switch for the bonding curve oracle,  Change the oracle durations used to calculate time-weighted average prices,  Change the protocol controlled value (PCV) deposit address,  Change the reweight incentive amount,  Change the minimum distance from the peg required for reweight incentivization,  Change incentive contract addresses,  Add and remove addresses that are exempt from incentivizations,  Change the growth rate and time weight for the incentivization calculations,  Withdraw FEI from the Uniswap pool back to the protocol treasury,  Setup new token pairs for use by the protocol,  Change oracle addresses,  Change the genesis group address,  Assign a new beneficiary for the IDO contract  There are functions in place to transfer these roles to other addresses and to allow for the abdication of the Guardian role in the future.  In addition to these roles, there are also Minter, Burner, and PCV Controller roles. The Governor can assign these roles to any address, and has all of their abilities.  They can:  Mint new tokens,  Burn tokens held by any address  Security model and trust assumptions  Voters use TRIBE to vote. It is paid out to liquidity providers, traders, and referrers. TRIBE can be delegated and is transferable. The voting system has the ability to arbitrarily update many critical variables and contracts. This includes the ability to change pricing oracles, which means the voting system has all the powers of an oracle, along with many more. In this audit, we assume that the voters will not pass proposals that would harm FEI.  The  protocol is pegged to the exchange rate of ETH/USDC as a proxy for ETH/USD. Therefore, FEI is exposed to the risks inherent in USDC. In this audit, we do not assess the risks in the USDC protocol and their effects on the  protocol.

In this audit, we assume that the voters will not pass proposals that would harm FEI.  The Fei protocol is pegged to the exchange rate of ETH/USDC as a proxy for ETH/USD. Therefore, FEI is exposed to the risks inherent in USDC. In this audit, we do not assess the risks in the USDC protocol and their effects on the Fei protocol.  The Fei protocol is initialized to use the Uniswap pricing oracle, which is integral to the system. During this audit, we assumed that the administrator and price feeds are available, honest, and not compromised.  Findings  Here we present three client-reported issues, followed by our findings.  Bypass burn penalty (client reported)  The client reported an economic vulnerability that could be used to bypass the burn penalty applied upon selling FEI. Contracts which hold pooled FEI owned by users and with the ability to withdraw to an arbitrary address, the following attack is possible:  Withdraw FEI from the pooled contract to the FEI/ETH Uniswap pool.  The burn penalty is then borne by the contract which holds FEI pooled from other users.  Execute the swap on Uniswap to receive ETH.  This attack can be executed by a secondary Uniswap market, or other contracts that pool ERC20 tokens. This has been addressed in PR#10.  Rounding errors during reweight (client reported)  The client reported an issue that affects the accuracy of reweighting to re-establish the peg. If a reweight happens when the protocol is the only liquidity provider, the dust left in the Uniswap pool prevents accuracy when reweighting the peg. The error can be over 5% at times. This has been addressed in PR#22.  Attacker can manipulate ETH/FEI spot price on allocations (client reported)  The client reported a vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate the spot price of the ETH/FEI Uniswap pool by performing a flash loan to borrow ETH and buy FEI, moving the price up right before an allocation is executed, and sell that FEI amount after the allocation is done to make a profit. This has been addressed in PR#81.  Update  Most of the following issues have been either fixed, partially fixed, or acknowledged by the Fei Team. Our analysis of the mitigations is limited to the specific changes made to cover the issues, and disregards all other unrelated changes in the pull requests and in the codebase.  Critical severity  [C01] Anyone can steal all the TRIBE tokens from the reward pool  The FeiPool contract allows users to deposit FEI/TRIBE liquidity pool (LP) tokens and earn TRIBE tokens as a reward. The amount of TRIBE that a user can claim is given by the following formula:  Where releasedReward is the total amount of released reward tokens from the total amount available, redeemablePoolTokens is the amount of reward tokens that the user can claim, and totalRedeemablePoolTokens is the total amount of redeemable pool tokens by all the stakers participating in the pool. Both redeemablePoolTokens and totalRedeemablePoolTokens increase over time, which means that the more time the user leaves their stake in the pool, the more rewards they will be able to claim.  The issue lies in the fact that burnFrom function from ", "html_url": "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/fei-protocol-audit#genesisgroup", "labels": ["OpenZeppelin"]}, {"title": "Update: Fixed in PR#32.", "body": "The FeiPool contract no longer inherits from the ERC20Burnable contract. Additionally, the burnFrom public function was removed, and a new _burnFrom function was added to be used in the _withdraw function.  [L02] Authorized burners can burn FEI balances without an amount restriction  The Protocol uses a Burner role to manage permissions around token burning, which the incentivization model requires.  burnFrom function in the  Fei contract uses the internal  _burn function from the OpenZeppelin  burnFrom function from the OpenZeppelin  For the FEI token, consider using the burnFrom function from ERC20Burnable rather than the _burn function from the ERC20 contract to minimize risk.  Update: Acknowledged. In the words of the Fei team: We feel that this risk is appropriate as the burner should not need ERC20 approval and is only given to one contract.  [L03] Core contract cannot allocate all Tribe tokens  The function allocateTribe in the Core contract is used to distribute TRIBE tokens to specified addresses. A percentage of TRIBE tokens remains undistributed as a treasury. According to the Fei whitepaper, the community can distribute this as it sees fit as the protocol develops.  However, in the allocation process, the function requires that the amount to be distributed is strictly less than the contracts TRIBE balance. This means that the contract cannot allocate all of the TRIBE tokens it holds, and a single unit of TRIBE will be locked in the contract.  Consider changing the require statement to use >= instead of >, so that all of the TRIBE it holds can be allocated.  Update: Fixed in PR#33.  [L04] Multiple outdated Solidity versions in use  Outdated versions of Solidity are being used in all contracts. The compiler options in the truffle-config file specifies version 0.6.6, which was released on April 6, 2020. Throughout the codebase there are also different versions of Solidity being used. For example, most of the Solidity files specify supported versions ^0.6.0, while the following files specify supported versions ^0.6.2:  IPCVDeposit.sol  IUniswapPCVController.sol  IFei.sol  IIncentive.sol  IUniswapIncentive.sol  As Solidity is now under a fast release cycle, consider using a more recent version of the compiler, such as version 0.7.6. In addition, to avoid unexpected behavior, consider specifying explicit Solidity versions in pragma statements.  Update: Not fixed. In the words of the Fei Team: It is not possible due to dependence on solidity compiler version 0.6.6 due to Uniswap interfaces.  [L05] Not checking for 0 addresses  Some constructors do not check that an initialized address is not 0. This could result in loss of control or locked funds. Examples include:  beneficiary address in the LinearTokenTimelock constructor  admin address in the Timelock constructor  Consider validating that addresses are not 0 to ensure contracts operate as intended.  Update: Fixed in PR#39.  [L06] Not using SafeMath and SafeCast  Throughout the codebase there are math operations that are not checked for overflow or underflow using the SafeMath library. Examples can be found in the following locations, however this list is not exhaustive:  The Roots library  The LinearTokenTimelock contract  The alreadyReleasedAmount function  The _beforeTokenTransfer function  The checkAllocation function  The getFinalPrice function  Although we did not observe instances which appear at high risk of overflow, consider checking all math operations using SafeMath as a best practice. In addition, the getFinalPrice function casts an int256 value to uint256 without any checks. Consider using the SafeCast library to check casting operations.  Update: Partially fixed in PR#37 and PR#67. There are still some ocurrencies where SafeMath and SafeCast are not being used.  [L07] queueTransaction does not check transaction value  The queueTransaction function uses ETH in the Timelock contract to execute transactions. The contract is funded using the receive function, which can then be used to execute queued transactions. However, there is no easy way to withdraw ETH from the contract, and queueTransaction does not validate that ETH being sent in a queued transaction was provided for that purpose.  Consider making queueTransaction a payable function and validating msg.value == value to ensure proper allocation of funds. In addition, consider implementing a way to withdraw any remaining ETH from the contract after confirming success in the executeTransaction function.  Update: Not fixed. In the words of the Fei Team: We want to minimize changes to forked DAO contracts.

Reflexer Labs\u2019 statement for this issue:", "body": "We will have to delay this but we will take care of it.  [L09] Lack of input sanitization  Throughout the codebase, many contracts have an instance of the function modifyParameters(), which allows authorized accounts to change parameters of the protocol. For example, such functions exist in the CoinSavingsAccount contract and in the GlobalSettlement contract, among many others.  GlobalSettlement contract, no changes to  AccountingEngine contract, some delay parameters are not bounded, allowing them to be set to excessively high values. And in the  CollateralAuctionHouse contract, some parameters are immediately cast to  Furthermore, values passed into constructors for various contracts do not contain input checks. For example, the constructor for the BasicCollateralJoin contract contains no checks that the two address parameters are not address(0), and neither does the constructor of the CollateralAuctionHouse contract.  Update: Aknowledged, not fixed. Reflexer Labs statement for this issue:  We understand the concern although wed like to stick to what we inherited from MCD.  [L10] Repeated code  Throughout the code base, there is consistent use of repeated code. Some instances of repeated code are as follows:  All the arithmetic functions, such as in AccountingEngine or in OracleRelayer, are repeated in many contracts. Note that these arithmetic functions are well covered by OpenZeppelin Math libraries, which are battle tested and widely adopted contracts.  The governance functions addAuthorization and removeAuthorization, and the modifier isAuthorized are repetitive.  Similarly, the either and both functions, which are just performing logical OR and AND operations, are often repeated in the code base.  Lines 199-201 of the disableContract function in the StabilityFeeTreasury contract are the same as the joinAllCoins function.  The conditions on lines 317-320 and line 348 of the LiquidationEngine contract are identical.  Lines 489-491 and 353-355 of the SAFEEngine contract are repeated.  Lines 717 and 726 of the FixedDiscountCollateralAuctionHouse contract are repeated.  getApproximateCollateralBought and getCollateralBoughtfunctions of the FixedDiscountCollateralAuctionHouse contract are almost identical.  Solidity language provides the use of libraries to call functions that need to be accessed by several contracts and that are always the same. Having libraries is easy for code maintenance since any bug or new functionality can be coded in only one single contract that serves all the others. Also, libraries can also help in reducing the gas cost associated with deployment and use of the contracts while reducing the potential attack surface. Contracts can also define internal functions that are then called internally in many places.  Consider adopting libraries and internal functions design to improve code size, quality and readability at the same time.  Update: Partially fixed in pull request #84. Lines 199-201 in StabilityFeeTreasury have been replaced with a call to joinAllCoins, and the getAdjustedBid function has been created to consolidate functionality for getApproximateCollateralBought and getCollateralBought.  [L11] Uncommented assembly block  The OracleRelayer contract includes an assembly block in the rpower() function. The same assembly block is repeated in the TaxCollector and CoinSavingsAccount contracts.  CollateralAuctionHouse,  LiquidationEngine,  SAFEEngine,  StabilityFeeTreasury and  TaxCollector contracts are using assembly lines without any docstring or comment.  While this does not pose a security risk per se, it is at the same time a complicated and critical part of the system. Moreover, as this is a low-level language that is harder to parse by readers, consider including extensive documentation regarding the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what every single assembly instruction does. This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to verify it, and for developers to build on top of it or update it.  Note that the use of assembly discards several important safety features of Solidity, which may render the code unsafer and more error-prone. Hence, consider implementing thorough tests to cover all potential use cases of these functions to ensure they behave as expected.    We will have to delay this.  [L12] Unnecessary require statements  There are several instances in the code base where the require statements or conditional checks are unnecessary. For instance:  In the OracleRelayer contract, the require statement in the modifyParameters function at line 189 checks if the input parameter data &gt; 0. This is unnecessary since the same condition is already checked in the require statement at line 187.  In the StabilityFeeTreasury contract, the require statement in the constructor at line 113 checks if the input address accountingEngine_ is not the same as address(this).
