While this does not pose a security risk per se and the code does not present vulnerabilities after thorough review, these blocks are a critical part of the system and should be better documented. Moreover, as this is a low-level language that is harder to parse by readers, consider including extensive documentation regarding the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what every single assembly instruction does. This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to verify it, and for developers to build on top of it or update it.  In particular, consider explaining:  Why the arguments have to be moved from calldata.  How delegateAndReturn and delegateToViewAndReturn provide the return value without the return keyword.  That the 0x20 hardcoded value in the reverts of delegateTo and delegateToViewImplementation exists to offset a bytes array, and the reason for this offset.  Why this offset is not used in the reverts of the delegateToViewAndReturn and delegateAndReturn functions.  Why the return is displaced by 0x40 in the delegateToViewAndReturn function and why it is not needed in the delegateAndReturn function.  Note that the use of assembly discards several important safety features of Solidity, which may render the code unsafe or more error-prone. Hence, consider implementing thorough tests to cover all potential use cases of these functions to ensure they behave as expected.  Low severity  [L01] Price manipulation possible in SimplePriceOracle  The setUnderlyingPrice and setDirectPrice functions from the SimplePriceOracle contract allow the caller to set asset prices in the contract storage. However, these functions do not implement any access control mechanism and have their visibility set as public, thus allowing anyone to execute them.  Any contract using this Oracle to determine the price of an asset could be subject to price manipulation attacks by anyone.  Although the Compound team has explained that this contract is only to be deployed on testnets, consider specifying this through comments or documentation, and consider enforcing this programmatically, perhaps by ensuring that chainid is not equal to 1.For the general public and the whole DeFi space, we highlight that this contract must not be deployed into mainnet.  [L02] Lack of indexed parameters in PricePosted event  None of the parameters in the PricePosted event defined in the SimplePriceOracle contract are indexed.  Consider indexing the asset parameter to ease the task of searching and filtering for specific events.  [L03] The SAI Price is Unchangeable after SCD shutdown  In the PriceOracleProxy contract, setSaiPrice is able to be called once, upon Single Collateral Dai shutdown, to set the price of SAI within Compound. Afterwards, this price cannot be changed. It is intended that the peg be set to equal the exchange rate at which Maker will purchase SAI for ETH after SCD shutdown.  In anticipation of this, Compound has already shut down the ability to supply or borrow SAI. Users may only withdraw SAI or repay borrows with SAI. Notably, users holding SAI may still take out loans.  Although it is unlikely that the actual market price of SAI will deviate from the peg, there is a chance that it could. If it does, Compound will have no way to change the internal price set for SAI without updating the price via governance. If SAIs real market price increases, it may cause confusion as users will be able to borrow less than they anticipate, and be liquidated sooner than anticipated, when using SAI as collateral. If SAIs real market price drops, users holding SAI as collateral may be able to borrow more value than the SAI they hold is worth, creating insolvency risk for the protocol.  In the unlikely event of SAIs price dropping, and assuming Compound holds a total of 600,000 SAI with a SAI collateral factor of 0.75, Compound would be at risk of losing at most $450,000 USD worth of value. Please note that this will be measured in ETH value post-SCD shutdown, so these figures may change. However for comparison, Compound currently custodies about $115M USD worth of assets, so this risk is small relative to the overall size of all Compound markets.  In the event that SAIs market price diverges from the peg, consider initiating a governance proposal to change the oracle to one that actively reports the real market price of SAI. Additionally, consider using the borrowAllowed hook to prevent users from any further borrowing until their balanceOf cSAI is 0.  Notes & Additional Information    Conclusion  No critical or high severity issues were found. Recommendations were made to mitigate risks related to edge cases involving specific market conditions, and to improve the projects overall quality and robustness.

Pods allow users to choose an intermediate point on this spectrum, where the probability of winning a particular lottery scales with the size of the pod, but each users share of the winnings is reduced accordingly.  It seems that the usefulness of this feature depends on each users ability to choose the size of the pod that they would like to join, and hence where they fall on the payoff spectrum. They may also want to join a pod with specific participants. However, the lack of access control or lock-in undermines this goal, since a given user may find themselves in a significantly larger or smaller pod than they anticipated, due to the actions of other users.  Consider introducing access control or lock-in requirements, or at least documenting the reason for their absence.  Update: The PoolTogether team have indicated that this is the intended behavior, since they prefer to launch this feature with minimal initial restrictions.  [N02] Magic constant  When a pod wins a lottery, the rewarded function is executed with a stipend of 200000 gas. The reason for this decision was explained to us during the audit but we believe it should also be documented in the contract. Consider documenting the reason for the limit, as well as why the particular value of 200000 was chosen.  Update: Fixed in PoolTogether PR#25. The BasePool.callRewarded comment includes an explanation of the stipend.  [N03] Duplicated Code  In the ExchangeRateTracker contract, the currentExchangeRateMantissa function could be simplified by calling the currentExchangeRate function.  Similarly, the tokenToCollateralValue function and the collateralToTokenValue function could reuse the tokenToCollateralValueAt and collateralToTokenValueAt functions respectively (perhaps after a minor refactor).  Update: Partially fixed in PR#8. The currentExchangeRateMantissa function was removed. The conversion functions were retained for convenience.  [N04] Reinitialize exchange tracker  The ExchangeRateTracker data structure can be reinitialized, effectively clearing its contents.  To improve predictability, consider preventing initialize from being called on an initialized tracker. If desired, a reset function can be used instead.  Update: Fixed in PR#9. There is a check to ensure initialize can only be called once.  [N05] Unnecessary addition  When calculating the unconsolidated balance, the result may be calculated by adding zero to the desired value. Consider setting the result directly without the unnecessary addition.  Update: This issue is obsolete because the function was removed when addressing [L03] Complicated Code.

To favor readability and avoid unnecessary validations, consider removing the unfulfillable condition.  [N05] Missing inheritance in Affiliates contract  To favor consistency and explicitness, consider modifying the Affiliates contract so that it inherits from the IAffiliates contract.  [N06] Redundant boolean check in ERC1155 contract  Lines 151 and 215 of the ERC1155 contract both explicitly compare a boolean value to true. This is a redundant operation because the result will be equivalent to the boolean value itself. Consider removing the redundant comparison.  [N07] ERC1155 token contract is an approved operator  returns true if the queried operator is the token contract itself. Although the contract can update balances at will, referring to it as an operator for a particular account may be confusing, particularly since it introduces an inconsistency between the  ERC1155 reference implementation.  Consider returning false when the queried operator is the token contract itself.  [N08] Unnecessary ERC1155 hooks in internal burn functions  _burn and  _burnBatch functions of the  To favor simplicity, consider removing the doAcceptanceCheck flag, and related logic, from the internal burn functions of the ERC1155 contract.

This function first  validates that the current universe is not forking before continuing execution.  Similarly, the migrateThroughOneFork function of the Market contract ensures the market is not finalized, but this condition is checked in the following call to disavowCrowdsourcers  To favor simplicity and reduce gas costs, consider removing the redundant validations.  [N10] Inconsistent behavior in GnosisSafeRegistry contract  The GnosisSafeRegistry contract implements two different functions for registering new Gnosis Safe Multisig wallets: register and callRegister. However, by calling register instead of callRegister, it is possible to register wallets that:  May not have approved Cash tokens to the Augur contract  May not have approved Cash tokens nor ShareTokens to the CreateOrder contract  May not have approved Cash tokens nor ShareTokens to the FillOrder contract  May not have set a fingerprint in the Affiliates contract  Consider either providing a single function for registering wallets in the GnosisSafeRegistry contract, or explicitly documenting the described inconsistent behavior between the register and callRegister functions, highlighting under which circumstances each function is expected to be called.  [N11] Naming  In the GnosisSafeRegistry contract, the getSafe function should be renamed to getCurrentSafe, getActiveSafe or similar.  In the WarpSync contract:  State variable MARKET_LENGTH should be renamed to MARKET_DURATION  Structure Data and state variable data should have more self-explanatory names.  [N12] Lack of explicit visibility in state variables  The following state variables are implicitly using the default visibility:  In the AffiliateValidator contract: keys, operators and usedSalts.  In the Market contract: affiliateValidator and affiliates.  To favor readability, consider explicitly declaring the visibility of all state variables.  [N13] Named return variables  Named return variables are used inconsistently. For example, while the ProxyFactory contract names its return variables, the Affiliates contract does not. Consider removing all named return variables, explicitly declaring them as local variables, and adding the necessary return statements where appropriate. This should improve both explicitness and readability of the project.  [N14] Reuse zero address constant in Market contract  In line 344 of Market.sol, considering replacing address(0) with the NULL_ADDRESS constant to favor consistency.  [N15] Inconsistent imports  The following imports are not used:  The IWarpSync.sol file unnecessarily imports the IUniverse contract.  The Market.sol file unnecessarily imports the IERC1155 contract.  Consider removing the unnecessary imports.  On the other hand, the following contracts rely on indirect imports:  GnosisSafeRegistry.sol uses the IAugur.sol imports to obtain the IERC20 contract.  WarpSync.sol uses the IMarket.sol imports to obtain the IAugur contract.  Consider importing these contracts explicitly.

However, only prices reported from trusted sources, defined in the sources array, are taken into account to calculate the official median price of an asset. This system design renders prices reported from untrusted reporters pointless, though at the same time allows them to submit prices.

Similarly, the get and put functions can also benefit from more self-explanatory naming.  The data address of the OpenOracleView contract should be renamed to clearly denote it refers to a contract address.  The source function of the OpenOracleData contract should be renamed to getSource, getSourceFromMessage or similar.  The PriceUpdated event of the DelFiPrice contract should be renamed to MedianPriceUpdated.  The prices mapping of the DelFiPrice contract should be renamed to medianPrices.  [N06] Declare uint as uint256  The projects code often uses uint as variable type. See for example lines 36, 53 and 58 of the DelFiPrice.sol contract.  To favor explicitness, all instances of uint should be declared as uint256.  [N07] Unnecessary casting operations  line 54 of DelFiPrice.sol, the  stored as an OpenOraclePriceData type. Therefore, consider removing the unnecessary casting operations.  [N08] Unused named return variable  The  DelFiPrice contract declares a named return variable called median. Given that it is not used, consider removing this variable.  [N09] Considerations on rogue sources  According to its specification, Compounds Open Oracle relies on a consortium of trusted sources that make asset prices available on known https endpoints. Anyone can query these public web endpoints, obtaining the signed data that is later expected to be posted on Ethereum smart contracts. Anyone can post data on chain, but only data signed by the trusted sources will be considered when calculating the median price for an asset.  Each source will have an associated Ethereum address under which their prices will be registered on chain. The number of sources is not enforced in any way at the smart contract level. More interestingly, the array holding all trusted sources addresses is set at deployment and cannot be later modified.  The oracles official price for an asset is the median of a set of prices reported by the trusted sources. Therefore, it only takes 50% of the sources to go rogue in order to manipulate the oracles price at will. The cartelized sources will have total control of the oracles official price, even if the remaining 50% of the sources keep reporting the real prices of an asset. It is unclear how many sources the Open Oracle will trust, but the lower the number of sources, the easier it would be to conduct this attack. While a conglomerate of malicious sources may sound unlikely at first, one should take into account that the incentives for a set of sources to take control over the oracle increase with the number of projects fully relying on the oracles prices. If initially trusted sources happen to go rogue and manipulate prices before the Compound team notices, all on-chain finance systems trusting the Open Oracle may suffer severe financial losses.  The Compound team is aware of the potential risk of rogue sources, and according to the specification The consortium operates on a trust-but-verify principle. If reporters use timestamps too far in the future or report prices which deviate too far from the norm, they will likely be voted out of the Compound Reference Price view. At the time of the audit there is no governance mechanism in place to vote out a trusted source. As a consequence, the only available way to replace sources is to re-deploy the DelFiPrice contract with a new set of sources.  So as to rapidly detect and mitigate any malicious behavior, we strongly advise closely monitoring the prices and timestamps posted on chain, tracking the Write event triggered after every price update.

There is alaso an exercise action that can be done only during a specific time window defined by the windowSize variable (which closes at expiry).  Instead of subtracting the windowSize from expiry to know the start point where exercise can be executed, it is clearer to define 2 variables: startsExercisability and endsExercisability.  Consider changing the logic to have a start time where these actions can be executed and an end time where the contract expires.  Note: this issue is related to [C01] Malicious users could steal with and from the OptionsContract contract and any mitigation should consider both simultaneously.  Update: The Opyn team explained the exercise window allows for the existence of both American and European Options. American Options can be exercised at any time until expiry, European Options can only be exercised on the last day or so.  [L07][Fixed] Repo owner could lose collateral if leftover oTokens are not burnt before the option expires  Currently, Repo owners are allowed to freely mint oTokens by providing collateral. However, there is no way for the Repo owner to redeem the corresponding collateral for any unsold oTokens after the option expires. The Repo owners are supposed to burn all unsold oTokens before expiry to avoid losing the corresponding collateral.  While this design works and makes sense, it is quite risky for the Repo owners and it is unclear that Repo owners are bearing risks of being stuck with their own oTokens.  Consider adding more documentation and warnings in the code to further advice Repo owners, or only allow issuing oTokens when a trade occurs.  Update: The team confirmed this is an expected behavior, comments are added in line 442 of the follow up commit to ensure users are only issuing oTokens when a trade occurs.  [L08][Fixed] Factorize Repo ownership into modifier  In several functions of the OptionsContract, such as issueOTokens, the function is marked as public but further restricts the operation to only the Repo.owner inside the code.  Since this pattern appears in several functions, consider implementing a isRepoOwner() modifier to write less error-prone code instead of copying the code to check repo ownership in each function independently.  Update: Fixed in the follow-up commit 3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e where repos was replaced by newly introduced vaults. The function locates targeted vaults through vaults[msg.sender] and runs a check on if current msg.sender has a vault using hasVault(msg.sender).  [L09][Fixed] Unbalanced ETH operations  In OptionsContract contract, there is a payable fallback function that allows ETH to be sent to the contract but there is no way to withdraw.  Consider adding a withdraw function to the contract or do not accept ETH in the fallback function.  Update: Fixed in the follow-up commit 3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e where the payable fallback function was removed.  [L10] Unbounded loops  the Repo structs and  the contract addresses into the  Because there is no function that decreases the length of those arrays once those Repos and OptionsContracts are not needed, it is dangerous to loop through these arrays when they are too big.  In the contract OptionsContract the length of the repos array is used twice as a boundary for a for loop.  Because anyone can call the public openRepo function, someone could start creating Repos until the length of repos is too big to be processed in a block. At that moment, the function could not be called anymore.  Because the only function that uses the length of the repos array is getReposByOwner, and no other function calls getReposByOwner, the issue will not freeze the contracts logic. Nevertheless, consider removing unbounded loops from the contract logic in case a child contract uses a function implementing one of the loops.  Notes  [N01] No way to check liquidation allowance  Currently in OptionsContract contract, there is no way to check the maximum liquidation allowance. During a liquidation situation, liquidators have to blindly request an oToken amount they want to liquidate when calling liquidate.  Although it is within liquidators interest to liquidate as many oTokens as possible, there is no easy way to find out the maximum limit. The liquidate function will revert if liquidators try to liquidate too many oTokens. This design is not very user-friendly for liquidators, and it might cause liquidation events to fail multiple times due to the wrong balance being requested.  Consider adding a function to allow liquidators to get the maximum liquidation allowance for a certain Repo, or just allow liquidators to liquidate the maximum amount if their requests are over the maximum limit.

In OptionsContract, the isSafe function creates a variable called with the same name as the function. Consider changing the name to stillSafe.  In OptionsContract, the getPrice function gets the price of the asset in ETH, but the name where those values are saved suggest the opposite. Consider changing them to collateralToEthPrice and StrikeToEthPrice.

[N13][Fixed] Repo owners might not know their collateral balance  The project team mentioned that they are implementing new code into the getRepoByIndex function to return the collateral balance of a Repo owner. However, it might be confusing for a Repo owner to see their collateral value drops due to other users calling the exercise function.This issue was pointed out to us by the project team and asked for our recommendation.  The fact is when the collateral drops, the underlying contained in the contract increases with each exercise call. It might be beneficial to return both the collateral and underlying balances when a Repo owner checks their balance. It is self-explanatory that when other users call exercise, the collateral balance drops while the underlying balance increases. Consider retrieving both balances to the Repo owner to prevent confusions about their balances.  Update: Fixed in the follow-up commit 3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e where the newly added getVault() function returns both the collateral and underlying balances.

[N9][Partially Fixed] Misleading variable names  In OptionsContract, the variable amtCollateralToPayNum is actually the amount of collateral to pay in ETH, not in collateral.Consider renaming it to amtCollateralToPayInEthNum to avoid confusion.  In OptionsContract, the isSafe function creates a variable called with the same name as the function. Consider changing the name to stillSafe.  In OptionsContract, the getPrice function gets the price of the asset in ETH, but the name where those values are saved suggest the opposite. Consider changing them to collateralToEthPrice and StrikeToEthPrice.  Update: Partially Fixed in the follow-up commit 3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e where some of the variable names have been updated.  [N10][Fixed] Unknown use of multiple Repos per account  The OptionsContract allows any user to create a new Repo by calling the openRepo function.  However at the moment a single address can create as many Repos as they want but without getting a explicit benefit.  Consider adding to the documentation what are the benefits of doing this, or removing the possibility of having multiple Repos per account and allowing only one.  Update: Fixed in the follow-up commit 3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e where repos are replaced by vaults and only one vault is allowed per user.
