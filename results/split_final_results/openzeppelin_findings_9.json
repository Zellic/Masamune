The functions lacking input validation are either modified by the onlyGovernance modifier or are constructors. However simple human error in entering these values, by perhaps entering too many or too few 0s, can have far reaching negative consequences.  Some points where a lapse in input validation could be particularly problematic include:  There is no check in the callstack of the setAllocation function of the BondingCurve contract to ensure that the token featured in the BondingCurve is the token handled by the PCVDeposit. In the case this mismatch would occur, the PCVController would have to manually reallocate these stray tokens using the withdrawERC20 function.  The PCVDripController contract drips tokens from one PCVDeposit contract to another, but it never validates that the token each of them handle are the same. This means it could drip a token into a deposit contract that handles a different token. This mismatch could affect the accounting dictating the logic of the drip function. In particular, the check of dripEligible may wind up considering the balance of the wrong token.  The constructor of PCVSwapperUniswap contract does not check that the two tokens in the pair are tokenSpent and tokenReceived. This can affect the calculations of the inputs to the uniswap swap, leading to accounting errors in pcv.  Examples of onlyGovernor modified functions lacking input validation are:  The setFeiOracle function of the TribeReserveStabilizer contract doesnt check newFeiOracle is not the zero-address.  The setDuration function of the UniswapPCVController contract does not validation the _duration is non-zero or within sensible bounds.  The functions that could benefit from input validation in this codebase are numerous and there are many more than are listed here.  Consider implementing programmatic safeguards validating input parameters to ensure all function calls and contract constructions would fail early and loudly on erroneous inputs. This is needed especially in the case of functions or contracts vetted by governance, where subtle bugs in parameters that pass the governance process can have far reaching impacts on a system.  Update: Partially fixed in PR#75. The first 2 points outlined in this issue were not addressed, however the remaining issues were fixed.  [M04] ReserveStabilizer performs unsafe token transfer  The exchangeFei function of the ReserveStabilizer contract burns a users FEI and in exchange transfers them tokens at a discounted rate. However, the boolean return value of the token transfer performed is not checked. This means that ERC20-compatible tokens that return false on failure, such as ZRX, will not cause the call to revert. In turn the user will receive no tokens for their FEI.  Consider updating the token transfer to instead use OpenZeppelins SafeERC20, which will handle all edge cases of token transfers for you.  Update: Fixed in PR#71.  [M05] Incorrect use of Time-Weighted Average Prices  Throughout the codebase, oracles of type IOracle are used to update, and read asset prices. These prices are then used to inform decisions that together try to keep the price of FEI stable. The oracle interface is designed such that the protocol can use any combination of oracles from different protocols, but currently only those from Chainlink, and Uniswap have been integrated  with the live protocol solely using Uniswap at launch in January, and now solely Chainlink. However, the way that the protocol inverts the price read from IOracle is not safe when the price is a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) calculated with an arithmetic mean, as is the case with Uniswap V2.  For example, assume we have tokens ABC and DEF, where the price of ABC/DEF at time 1 is 100, and the price at time 5 is 700. With some simplification of scaling, the cumulative prices tracked in UniswapV2 would be:  The average prices over the window from 0 to 5 are therefore calculated as:  If instead of using the DEF price of 0.00314, the inverted ABC price is used, this is a price of 1/580 = 0.00172. This is approximately 54% of the correct price.  The codebase twice uses the IOracle.invert function to calculate the reciprocal of a price like this  without knowledge of whether the oracle is using Chainlink spot prices, Uniswap TWAPs, or something else. If these prices are TWAPs, the amount returned to a caller by the ReserveStabilizer, and the slippage parameter in the PCVSwapperUniswap will be incorrect by potentially large percentages.  Consider updating the code to ensure that Uniswap TWAPs are never inverted using a reciprocal, and instead the inverse accumulator is used to correctly calculate the inverse TWAP.

[N10] Missing Natspec  While the majority of the codebase is well-commented, with Natspec used for most functions, there are some places that Natspec is missing or incomplete. Some examples of this are:  setWhitelistUsers has no Natspec.  getPositionDebtShareOf does not describe its parameters. The same is true of getPositionDebts.  Natspec is missing throughout BNum. Though this contract is out of the scope of this audit, its functions are used in the scope of the audit.  The @return tag to describe return parameters is not used except in WMasterChef.  Consider updating the above examples and checking that complete Natspec exists for all functions throughout the codebase.  Update: Partially fixed in PR#116. Points 1 and 2 above were corrected, however the team chose not to correct points 3 and 4.  [N11] Naming issues hinder understanding and clarity of the codebase  To favor explicitness and readability, several parts of the contracts may benefit from better naming. Our suggestions are to rename:  event SetPrimarySource to event SetPrimarySources.  getPair in BalancerSpellV1, SushiswapSpellV1, and UniswapV2SpellV1 to getAndApprovePair.  px to price or ethPerX.  collateralSize to collateralAmount.  allBanks to tokensWithBank.  allowContractStatus to allowContractCalls.  balanceOfERC20 to localBalanceOfERC20.  struct Oracle to struct TokenFactors.  stSushi and enSushi to startSushiRewards and endSushiRewards, respectively.  stRewardPerToken and enRewardPerToken to startRewardPerToken and endRewardPerToken, respectively.  Consider renaming these parts of the contracts to increase overall code clarity.  Update: Partially fixed in PR#117. Some of the above recommendations were implemented.  [N12] No SPDX Identifiers  Consider adding SPDX License Identifiers to the top of each Solidity file in your codebase. Declaring the license associated with your codebase in this manner can help mitigate licensing confusions, and thereby increase community involvement, contributions, and collaborations.  Update: Fixed in PR#118.  [N13] Not using delete to zero values  In the unsetOracles function within the ProxyOracles contract, when entries inside the oracles mapping are unset, they are manually replaced with an empty Oracle struct.  To simplify the code and clarify intent, consider using delete instead.  Update: Fixed in PR#119.  [N14] Using now instead of block.timestamp  Throughout SushiswapSpellV1 and UniswapV2SpellV1, now is used rather than block.timestamp to refer to the block time. This term can be misleading and is deprecated in more recent versions of Solidity.  Consider using block.timestamp for clarity and to facilitate future upgrades.  Update: Fixed in PR#120.  [N15] Using outdated OpenZeppelin contracts  The codebase relies on OpenZeppelin Contracts version 3.2.0, which is outdated. Considering the Solidity version in use throughout the codebase, the latest compatible version of OpenZeppelin Contracts is 3.4.0. Consider using the most recent version of OpenZeppelin Contracts where possible.  Update: Fixed in PR#121  [N16] Visibility too permissive for ensureApprove  ensureApprove function accepts a  BasicSpell contract. Given that these approvals will only be relevant to the system if they are made from within a spell, the  Consider limiting function visibility where possible to improve the overall clarity and readability of the code.  Update: Fixed in PR#122.  [N17] Typos  The codebase contains the following typos:  Reserev should be Reserve.  the spell approve should be the spell has approved.  to the bank should be in the bank.  if not exist should be if it does not exist.  resolve should be resolved.  basis point should be basis points.  positon should be position.  trigger should be triggering.  bank not exists should be bank does not exist.

The pool id that that you received LP token back should be The pool id that you will receive LP tokens back to.  Consider correcting these typos to improve code readability.  Update: Partially fixed in PR#123  some of the above recommendations were implemented.  [N18] Declare uint as uint256  Throughout the codebase, the datatype uint is used as an alias for the more explicit uint256. To favor explicitness, consider declaring all instances of uint as uint256.    [N19] Uninformative revert messages in require statements  There are several instances in the codebase where require statements have ambiguous or imprecise error messages.

Aside from minor differences in revert messages, these functions sharing the same name have identical logic.  Assuming both of these PRs are merged without additional changes made, there will be duplicate functions across modules in this codebase. This can cause many problems in terms of the maintainability of the codebase.  Consider consolidating duplicate functions within a common library.  Update: Fixed in commit 3c684f4079b118d6aa42cbb4ce944a885f50707e.  [L02] Constant is not declared explicitly  The ATTESTATION_SIZE_BYTES constant is defined in the DisputeManager contract to be 161. Literal values in the codebase without an explained meaning make the code harder to read, understand and maintain, thus hindering the experience of developers, auditors, and external contributors alike.  Developers should define a constant variable for every magic value used (including booleans), giving it a clear and self-explanatory name. Additionally, for complex values, inline comments explaining how they were calculated or why they were chosen are highly recommended.  Consider either defining ATTESTATION_SIZE_BYTES to be a sum of intermediate constants or documenting in comments from where it is derived.  Update: Fixed in commit d5487d80f9dd099f2970ea98e34ff30813c7693e.  [L03] Same event used for multiple variables  The ParameterUpdated event of the Managed contracts (including the DisputeManager contract) is emitted whenever a new value is set for a contract parameter.  In the case of the _setSlashingPercentage function, the event is emitted only once two variables are set. Moreover, neither old nor new values are emitted together with the event.  Consider being more explicit in the event string input parameter to reflect that two variables have been set.  Update: Fixed in commit 7709b944fdbef185a06d48937a099f0b4b19339b.  [L04] Unclear lack of input validation  The initialize and setSlashingPercentage functions of the DisputeManager contract are lacking of any input validation for the _qrySlashingPercentage and _idxSlashingPercentage variables.  At the same time, the comment in line 264 suggests that those slashing percentages are allowed to be zero.  If this is true and theres a dispute that has been created, any call to acceptDispute will internally call the _slashIndexer and the call will ultimately fail and revert here because of the zero values of the slashing percentages.  This is not a security issue as in this case, to finalize the dispute, the drawDispute function should be called instead. However, unexpected failures may confuse the users.  Consider adding a check in the acceptDispute function that will revert early and loudly whenever a dispute is trying to be accepted with zero slashing percentages. Moreover, make sure to set these parameters to positive values if disputes are intended to be accepted.  Update: Fixed in commit 3b38f9e6d82b7cf7169cad111d9c9cf4cdea3326 where documentation was included to clarify that acceptDispute will fail under certain conditions and that best course of action is to resolve using drawDispute or rejectDispute.  Notes & Additional Information  [N01] Default value used  The IDisputeManager interface is using the zero value DisputeType.IndexingDispute as meaningful value for the enum.  Zero values should never be used to represent meaningful states or values for contract variables, as this can lead to confusion.  Consider adding an initial Null state to the enum to explicitly set non-zero values to proper DisputeTypes.  Update: Fixed in commit 59157c8705c7cda991b6609ede463c6e542d2201.

When the _tokens parameter is zero, the collect function can run without error, and emit its AllocationCollected event. This provides no useful feedback in the form of a revert message if the parameter was malformed by the client. Furthermore, the emission of the trivial AllocationCollected event may confuse off-chain services.  In the case that allowing collect to be called on zero _tokens was a design choice, consider properly documenting this in the code and other public-facing documentation.

Update: Fixed in commit bd06a61e1055a5e0585e8ea64e618a8d6ce65d7c where the collect function now includes documentation describing that zero values of _tokens are allowed.  [L02] Unclean code  In the lockTokens function of the Stakes contract the weightedAverage function is called, but it is not clear what function parameters each of its four inputs denote. This is because as the inputs are passed in, their names are not suggestive of, or similar to, the parameters belonging to the function signature of the weightedAverage function.  This hinders readability and understanding of the code by auditors or other stakeholders.  Consider either documenting as comments in the code the correspondence of each input to parameter or defining and using intermediate variables with suggestive names as inputs.  Update: Fixed in PR465 at commit bead8f1e9f248764eec8f4ae5f627c86da33c78d.  Notes & Additional Information  [N01] Misleading naming  The diff function of the MathUtils library is performing a difference of the two numbers or returning zero if the result is negative.  Consider changing the name of the function to diffOrZero or some other name that can be more explicit on the purpose of the function.  Update: Fixed in commit 3ef27446c7eef64590e133358119d2cbbb0cad65.  [N02] Erroneous docstrings  The private _setDelegationParameters function of the Staking contract is copy/pasting the docstrings from the above setDelegationParameters function.  Consider giving this private function appropriate docstrings or avoid duplicating them to improve code readability and clarity.  Update: Fixed in commit c8255c05f2dca0a4c7f1574c730255a8c0d39d8c.  [N03] Inconsistent style  The _sendRewards function of the Staking contract makes an ERC20 Graph Token transfer and checks its success with a require statement. Within this same pull request, the _pushTokens helper function was introduced, making the same transfer and checking its success. This helper function is used in all the Staking contracts functions, making a Graph Token transfer, except for the _sendRewards function.  Taking into consideration how much value a consistent coding style adds to the projects readability, enforcing a standard coding style is recommended. For consistency, consider using the _pushTokens function for the token transfer within the _sendRewards function.  Update: Fixed in commit e11d04183d98f06276cd3fd38c4ad90c4cfd9b65.

However, if this function is not called as soon as a new contract is deployed, users may happen to use the protocol with an old cached version of the contracts. The consequences of this could be various and of different severities since many contracts in the protocol extends from the Managed contract.  Additionally, theres no easy way for users to know exactly when the last sync of the cache was performed, even if tech-savvy users can retrieve that information from transaction timestamps.  Consider documenting how the syncAllContracts function will be called and when, especially when addresses change, and ensure users have access to this information. Moreover, consider saving the timestamp of the last performed cache update so that users can easily retrieve the information directly from the contract and compare it with the deploy time of a new contract whose address must be synced.  Update: Fixed in commit 824bb25f17b70cf27c76fe72265f2fdb294a121f where documentation was updated and a new event ContractSynced is called when an address changes.  [M02] _resolveContract return value can cause failure  _resolveContract function of the  unset.  The return value of _resolveContract is expected to be a contract satisfying one of many interfaces so that other functions can call its methods. But, when the returned value is the zero-address, these attempts to call its methods will fail because the zero-address does not have a fallback function.  Following the fail early and loudly principle, consider including specific and informative error-handling structures to avoid unexpected failures.  Update: Acknowledged but not fixed. The Graph did not include that check because it is a frequently used function, with low probability to be zero and they were concerned about the gas cost of doing that check.  Low Severity  [L01] Duplicated getters  The Managed contract has been refactored to add getter functions that retrieve the addresses of the five contracts through the call to the _resolveContract internal function.  Contracts are set in the _syncContract function to the addressCache mapping that uses the keccak256 representation of the contract names as key values.  At the same time, the addressCache mapping is defined as public, and it exposes an automatically generated getter function that can be used to retrieve the same addresses by the direct use of the keccak256 name representation.  To be more gas efficient, consider either defining the addressCache mapping as private or removing the explicit getters to avoid duplicate getter functions.  Update: Fixed in commit 01dea49469c3c7bee0c1989ff80baa267c14fb0f where the addressCache mapping is defined to be private.  Notes & Additional Information  [N01] Event lacks detail  The SetController event of the Managed contract is emitted whenever the controller is set by _setController function and has the new controller as its only parameter.  It may benefit off-chain services to receive both the old value and the new value of this updated variable.  Consider including both the old and new values of the controller as parameters to the SetController event.  Update: Acknowledged. In the words of The Graph team:  The reason for not adding the old value is to maintain consistency and avoid changing the signature that is currently being used by third party services and the network subgraph.  [N02] Lack of indexed parameters in events  None of the parameters in the events defined in the Managed contract are indexed. Consider indexing event parameters to avoid hindering the task of off-chain services searching and filtering for specific events.  Update: Akcnowledged. In the words of The Graph team:  The ParameterUpdated events are not currently carrying values, just a variable name that then a subgraph can read from the contract. For that reason we dont see a huge gain to change the interface at this moment.  [N03] Inconsistent style  The onlyController modifier of the Managed contract deviates from the style of the other modifiers of this contract in that it does not wrap an internal function call.  Considering how much value a consistent coding style adds to the projects readability, we recommend enforcing a standard coding style.  Consider refactoring the onlyController modifier to wrap internal function calls to have style consistent with the other modifiers of this contract.  Update: Fixed in commit b1d4fa52b47964c16942845b5d82b5d5eae37237.  [N04] Missing functionality  The syncAllContracts function is externally callable, and it updates five featured contracts in just one single execution.  To be more gas efficient, if just one or a few of the five contracts change, consider implementing a function to sync just one contract at a time.  Update: Acknowledged.

Consider emitting events after sensitive changes occur to facilitate tracking and notify off-chain clients following the contracts activity.  Update: Fixed in PR462 at commit 1714b78d1243a824f36106539b34f8a79ebf14f3.  [M02] Proposals update can assume prior states  The updateProposal function of the GraphGovernance contract is designed to update either the votes or the resolution of a proposal.  The function is not checking whether the new parameters for the proposal, passed as input values, are different from those stored in the proposals mapping, or even if they have been used previously.  Specifically, the _votes parameter can be reused multiple times. Even if _votes is an IPFS hash of a collection of signatures for each vote for the _proposalId, this doesnt amount to a replay vulnerability. However, the fact that the updateProposal function call is revisiting prior data may lead to confusion.  Even worse, a proposals resolution can be changed from Accepted to Rejected and vice versa as many times as this function is called.  Whether this is a design choice or an unexpected outcome, consider either properly documenting this design choice or avoiding having a non-permanent or repetitive resolution on a specific proposal.  Moreover, consider adding some checks to verify that the values passed as input parameters are different from the stored or previously referenced data.  Update: Fixed in PR463 at commit 8a4fb6e5aeaf777879258ef0b4bdacde23ae30d7 where documentation describing the consequences of this design choice were added.  Low Severity  [L01] Lack of input validation  The initialize function of the GraphGovernance contract is not validating the input parameter passed in.  Consider adding proper checks to determine if the zero address is passed as an input parameter to avoid mistakenly setting the governor to a null address.  Update: Fixed in PR463 at commit f01518d1b669aeed89d3ceaa112b315cbdfb8f85.  [L02] Lack of docstrings  The IGraphGovernance interface, as well as the ProposalCreated and ProposalUpdated events, are lacking documentation in the form of docstrings or comments.  In the GraphGovernance contract, there is no documentation specifying which encoding or representation the parameters taking on IPFS hash values realize.  Consider thoroughly documenting all events and files in the codebase. When writing docstrings, consider following the Ethereum Natural Specification Format (NatSpec).  Update: Fixed in PR463 at commit e3cd5e35896b6ea6bbc794b874f98c462cf8cc21.  Notes & Additional Information  [N01] Lack of indexed parameters in events  The ProposalCreated and ProposalUpdated events of the GraphGovernance contract are lacking indexed parameters.  Consider indexing event parameters to avoid hindering the task of off-chain services searching and filtering for specific events.  Update: Fixed in PR463 at commit d7b25e5158f31b46e16dae043e1eafc7e715b989.  [N02] Useless event parameter  The ProposalCreated and ProposalUpdated events of the GraphGovernance contract are emitting the address of the msg.sender as the first parameter.  The functions emitting those events are only callable by the governor due to the onlyGovernor modifier. For this reason, there is no way that the msg.sender can be different at some point.  Since it can be known beforehand who the msg.sender is when emitting such events, consider removing this parameter from the event definitions and emissions.  Update: Fixed in PR363 at commit b1439ac9ca806234d3a4721d7594af8cf753c358.  Conclusions  2 Medium and other lower severity issues were found with changes recommended to improve the codebase.

[M04] Orders registration can be frontrun  The governance can call the ReserveSwapper contract to register a market order for a token pair. Once the order is registered, users can start calling the swap function and exchange one token for the other.  If the governance tries to update an already existing order, an order with a limited amount of tokens, that call can be frontrun by a malicious actor, which can call the swap function for the same token pair, zeroing the order amount in the accounting balance.  If this happens, after the new governance order has been mined, any further call to the swap function can unexpectedly fail in transferring the tokens, since the actual balances of the contract are not taken into account when registering the orders amount.  Consider checking if the contract has enough balance of the respective tokens before setting any non-limited order amount.    Wont fix  generally speaking, this module is meant to be holdover until we can create a more robust DAO treasury management system as part of a larger effort.

[M05] Same transaction on different proposal could revert  The GovernorAlpha contract implements the functionality to propose, vote, and execute proposals, among other actions.  Each proposal can have multiple transactions to process when it is being executed. When a proposal succeeds, these transactions are queued in the Timelock contract by passing all the transactions information and the time in which the transaction will be able allowed for execution.  However, because different proposals could have one same transaction with the same parameters among many different transactions, if two proposals are queued under the same block, then the first time in which the transaction could be executed will be the same, meaning that the hash used to identify that transaction will be taken. Therefore, during the queue process of the second proposal, the requirement that checks if it was already queued will revert.  Consider adding a proposal nonce as part of the hashed data to identify identical transactions as different ones on different proposals.    Wont fix  safe to assume two proposals will never need to be committed in the same block, and we dont want to modify widely-used forked code unnecessarily.  [M06] Underlying tokens could get stuck  The Incentivizer contract allows users to receive reward tokens when staking underlying assets into the contract.  However, because the contract requests underlying assets to be transferred into the contract in order to proceed, and due to human nature, users may transfer directly those underlying tokens with a simple ERC20 transfer transaction instead of calling the stake function.  Although the contract has a function that can be used to move any token into the reserve, the rescue function, this function works with any token except the underlying asset. Therefore, any underlying asset sent through a regular transfer transaction will get stuck in the contract without any possibility of taking it back.  Because underlying assets may be sent directly into the contract on a daily basis , consider implementing the possibility to withdraw those stuck assets from the contract.  Update: Fixed on pull request 14.  [M07] Deprecated TokenVesting draft contract is used  The Vester contract is using the TokenVesting contract provided in a previous deprecated draft version provided by OpenZeppelin.  Using deprecated contracts which are in draft status and not properly audited can be dangerous and increase the attack surface.  Consider properly documenting this and correctly inform users of its use.  Update: Acknowledged.  [M08] Unnecessary ABIEncoderV2  The ProxyRoot and Registry contracts are using the experimental ABIEncoderV2 pragma directive but there is no explicit use of it in the contract.  Furthermore, the usage of the experimental ABIEncoderV2 is discouraged in older Solidity versions since there have been important fixes for this encoder since then. The risk can be mitigated by being extra thorough on the testing process of the project at all levels. However, even with great tests there is always a chance to miss important issues that will affect the project.  Consider removing the directive from the contract files, and consider also more conservative options, or upgrading the Solidity version used to a newer version where the ABIEncoderV2 is stable, or rewriting the project to use the current stable encoder.  Update: Fixed on pull request 13. The ProxyRoot contract has been removed along with the usage of the ABIEncoderV2 pragma in the Registry contract.

Examples are:  The amount variable of the stake and withdraw functions from the Incentivizer contract is not validated to be non zero.  The propose function from the GovernorAlpha contract is not checking whether the description is empty or not.  The approve function from the Stake contract is not validating the spender input parameter.  Even though this issue does not pose a security risk, the lack of validation on user-controlled parameters may result in erroneous transactions or useless use of gas.

However, the precision of the outcome could be increased by altering the order of the operations by multiplying the time elapsed and the 2**112 factor to then take the ratio of it, which internally multiplies first the numerator with the BASE constant.

[M04] Insufficient incentives to liquidator  The Holdefi contract implements the liquidation process for those accounts that may have an under-collateralized balance or that may have been inactive for a whole year without interacting with the project.  The liquidation process is a very important part of every DeFi project because it allows to extinguish the problem of having the whole system under-collateralized under critical conditions of the market, and it needs a design that incentivizes its speed of execution.  Nevertheless, the only incentive that a liquidator has when calling the liquidateBorrowerCollateral function is to update its last time of activity. Not only that, but also it only updates the latest activity time for the collateral type involved in the liquidation process and not all the activity times of all collaterals. Liquidators that do not have the collateral involved in the contract, or any collateral at all, will not have any benefit for calling the liquidation process.  the liquidateBorrowerCollateral function will be high due to the  the clearDebts function, as it was pointed out in the issue  the buyLiquidatedCollateral function, by increasing the gas price, just after the transaction to the  Consider improving the incentive design to give the liquidators higher incentives to execute the liquidation process, or merging the functionalities from the liquidateBorrowerCollateral and the buyLiquidatedCollateral functions under one.

Consider checking whether a given asset price has already been added to the system by checking its existence in the assetPrices mapping before calling the setPrice function inside the addStableCoin function.
