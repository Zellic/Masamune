In this case, we would need to make sure to update the bookkeeping for the public vault that the lien was transferred to.

And on the PublicVault side, yIntercept, slope, last, epochData of VaultData need to be updated (this requires knowing the lien's end). However, private vaults do not keep a record of these values, and the corresponding values are only saved in stacks off-chain and validated on-chain using their hash.",

If we backtrack function calls to _validateCommitment, we arrive to 3 exposed endpoints:  commitToLiens  buyoutLien  commitToLien A call to commitToLiens will end up having the receiver be the AstariaRouter. A call to buyoutLien will set the receiver as the recipient() for the vault which is either the vault itself for public vaults or the owner for private vaults. So we are only left with commitToLien, where the caller can set the value for the receiver directly. 8 A call to commitToLien will initiate a series of function calls, and so receiver is only supplied to _validateCommit- ment to check whether it is allowed to be used and finally when transferring safeTransfer) wETH. This opens up exploiting scenarios where an attacker: 1. Creates a new private vault by calling newVault, let's call it V . 2. Takes a valid commitment C and combines it with V and supply those to commitToLien. 3. Calls withdraw endpoint of V to withdraw all the funds. For step 2. the attacker can source valid commitments by doing either of the following: 1. Frontrun calls to commitToLiens and take all the commitments C0, (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) , Cn and supply them one by one along with V to commitToLien endpoint of the vault that was specified by each Ci . 2. Frontrun calls to commitToLien endpoints of vaults, take their commitment C and combine it with V to send to commitToLien. 3. Backrun the either scenarios from the above points and create a new commitment with new lien request that tries to max out the potential debt for a collateral while also keeping other inequalities valid (for example, the inequality regarding liquidationInitialAsk).",

This can be used in a number of harmful ways. Examples of vulnerable endpoints are:  createLien: If we create the first lien but pass a stack with other liens, those liens will automatically be included in the stack going forward, which means that the collateral holder will owe money they didn't receive.  makePayment: If we make a payment on behalf of a collateral with no liens, but include a stack with many liens (all owed to me), the result will be that the collateral will be left with the remaining liens continuing to be owed  buyoutLien: Anyone can call buyoutLien(...) and provide parameters that are spoofed but satisfy some constraints so that the call would not revert. This is currently possible due to the issue in this context. As a consequence the caller can  _mint any unminted liens which can DoS the system.  _burn lienIds that they don't have the right to remove.  manipulate any public vault's storage (if it has been set as a payee for a lien) through its handleBuyout- Lien.

A vault decides to buy out a collateral's lien to offer better terms and so signs a commitment and some- one on behalf of the vault calls VaultImplementation.buyoutLien which if executed would call LienTo- ken.buyoutLien with the following parameters: 15 LienActionBuyout({ incoming: incomingTerms, position: position, encumber: ILienToken.LienActionEncumber({ collateralId: collateralId, amount: incomingTerms.lienRequest.amount, receiver: recipient(), lien: ROUTER().validateCommitment({ commitment: incomingTerms, timeToSecondEpochEnd: _timeToSecondEndIfPublic() }), stack: stack }) }) 2. The attacker fronrun the call from step 1. and instead provide the following modified parameters to LienTo- ken.buyoutLien LienActionBuyout({ incoming: incomingTerms, // not important, since it is not used and can be zeroed-out to save tx gas position: position, encumber: ILienToken.LienActionEncumber({ collateralId: collateralId, amount: incomingTerms.lienRequest.amount, receiver: msg.sender, // address of the attacker lien: ILienToken.Lien({ // note that the lien here would have the same fields as the original message by the vault rep. ,! token: address(s.WETH), vault: incomingTerms.lienRequest.strategy.vault, // address of the vault offering a better term strategyRoot: incomingTerms.lienRequest.merkle.root, collateralId: collateralId, details: details // see below }), stack: stack }) }) Where details provided by the attacker can be calculated by using the below snippet: uint8 nlrType = uint8(_sliceUint(commitment.lienRequest.nlrDetails, 0)); (bytes32 leaf, ILienToken.Details memory details) = IStrategyValidator( s.strategyValidators[nlrType] ).validateAndParse( commitment.lienRequest, s.COLLATERAL_TOKEN.ownerOf( commitment.tokenContract.computeId(commitment.tokenId) ), commitment.tokenContract, commitment.tokenId ); The result is that:  The newLienId that was supposed to be _minted for the recipient() of the vault, gets minted for the at- tacker.  The call to VaultImplementation.buyoutLien would fail, since the newLienId is already minted, and so the vault would not be able to receives the interests it had anticipated.  When there is a payment or Seaport auction settlement, the attacker would receive the funds instead. 16  The attacker can intorduces a malicous contract into the protocol ken.ownerOf(newLienId) without needing to register for a vault. that would be LienTo- To execute this attack, the attacker would need to spend the buyout amount of assets. Also the attacker does not necessarily need to front run a transaction to buyout a lien.

However, these Clearing Houses are only needed if the collateral goes to auction at Seaport, either through liquidation or the collateral holder choosing to sell them. The Astaria team has indicated that this behavior is intentional in order to put the cost on the borrower, since liquidations are already expensive. I'd suggest the perspective that all pieces of collateral will be added to the system, but a much smaller percentage will ever be sent to Seaport. The aggregate gas spent will be much, much lower if we are careful to only deploy these contract as needed. Further, let's look at the two situations where we may need a Clearing House: 1) The collateral holder calls listForSaleOnSeaport(): In this case, the borrower is paying anyways, so it's a no brainer. 2) Another user calls liquidate(): In this case, they will earn the liquidation fees, which should be sufficient to justify a small increase in gas costs.",

This approach should enable the function to be called multiple times, thus avoiding an \"out-of-gas\" error. An out-of-gas error is currently not very likely considering the maximum possible role number of 255. However, the method exists and could be called with a subset of the roles a policyholder. The method contains the following check: if (balanceOf(policyholder) == 0) revert AddressDoesNotHoldPolicy(policyholder); Therefore, it is not possible to call the method multiple times.

This is required to reduce the chance that an // instance is deployed with an invalid configuration that results in the instance being unusable. // Role ID 1 is referred to as the bootstrap role. There are still several ways a user can misstep and lose access to LlamaCore.  Bootstrap Role Scenarios While the bootstrap role is still needed: 1. Setting an expiry on the bootstrap role's policyholder RoleHolderData and allowing the timestamp to pass. Once passed any caller may remove the BOOTSTRAP_ROLE from expired policyholders. 2. Removing the BOOTSTRAP_ROLE from all policyholders. 3. Revoking the role's permission with setRolePermission(BOOTSTRAP_ROLE, bootstrapPermissionId, false).  General Roles and Permissions Similarly, users may allow other permissions to expire, or remove/revoke them, which can leave the contract in a state where no permissions exist to interact with it. The BOOTSTRAP_- ROLE would need to be revoked or otherwise out of use for this to be a problem.  Misconfigured Strategies A misconfigured strategy may also result in the inability to process new actions. For example: 1. Setting minApprovals too high. 2. Setting queuingPeriod unreasonably high 3. Calling revokePolicy when doing so would make policy.getRoleSupplyAsQuantitySum(approvalRole) fall below minApprovals (or fall below minApprovals - actionCreatorApprovalRoleQty). 1 & 2 but applied to disapprovals. And more, depending on the strategy (e.g. if a strategy always responded true to isActive).  Removal of Strategies It should not be possible to remove the last strategy of a Llama instance It is possible to remove all strategies from an Ilama instance. It would not be possible to create a new action afterward. An action is required to add other strategies back. As a result, the instance would become unusable, and access to funds locked in the Accounts would be lost.  Misconfigured Guards An accidentally overly aggressive guard could block all transactions. There is a built-in protection to prevent guards from getting in the way of basic management if (target == address(this) || target == address(policy)) revert CannotUseCoreOrPolicy();. Again, the BOOTSTRAP_ROLE would need to be revoked or otherwise out of use for this to be a problem.",

All 6 policyholders could participate in the approval, and two approvals would be sufficient instead of 4.

Morpho users can borrow any asset against them which should not be possible:  Isolated assets are by definition riskier when used as collateral and should only allow borrowing up to a specific debt ceiling.  The borrows are not backed on Aave as the isolated asset is not treated as collateral there, lowering the Morpho Aave position's health factor and putting the system at risk of liquidation on Aave.",

        "body": "The current implementation of Morpho has a specific logic to handle the scenario where Aave sets the asset's LTV to zero. We can see how Morpho is handling it in the _assetLiquidityData function function _assetLiquidityData(address underlying, Types.LiquidityVars memory vars) internal view returns (uint256 underlyingPrice, uint256 ltv, uint256 liquidationThreshold, uint256 tokenUnit) { ,! } // other function code... // If the LTV is 0 on Aave V3, the asset cannot be used as collateral to borrow upon a breaking withdraw. // In response, Morpho disables the asset as collateral and sets its liquidation threshold // to 0 and the governance should warn users to repay their debt. if (config.getLtv() == 0) return (underlyingPrice, 0, 0, tokenUnit); // other function code... The _assetLiquidityData function is used to calculate the number of assets a user can borrow and the maximum debt a user can reach before being liquidated. Those values are then used to calculate the user Health Factor. The Health Factor is used to  Calculate both if a user can be liquidated and in which percentage the collateral can be seized.  Calculate if a user can withdraw part of his/her collateral. The debt and borrowable amount are used in the Borrowing operations to know if a user is allowed to borrow the specified amount of tokens. On Aave, this situation is handled differently. First, there's a specific distinction when the liquidation threshold is equal to zero and when the Loan to Value of the asset is equal to zero. Note that Aave enforces (on the configuration setter of a reserve) that ltv must be <= of liquidationThreshold, this implies that if the LT is zero, the LTV must be zero. In the first case (liquidation threshold equal to zero) the collateral is not counted as collateral. This is the same behavior followed by Morpho, but the difference is that Morpho also follows it when the Liquidation Threshold is greater than zero. In the second case (LT > 0, LTV = 0) Aave still counts the collateral as part of the user's total collateral but does not increase the user's borrowing power (it does not increase the average LTV of the user). This influences the user's health factor (and so all the operations based on it) but not as impactfully as Morpho is doing. In conclusion, when the LTV of an asset is equal to zero, Morpho is not applying the same logic as Aave is doing, removing the collateral from the user's collateral and increasing the possibility (based on the user's health factor, user's debt, user's total collateral and all the asset's configurations on Aave) to  Deny a user's collateral withdrawal (while an Aave user could have done it).  Deny a user's borrow (while an Aave user could have done it).  Make a user liquidable (while an Aave user could have been healthy).  Increasing the possibility to allow the liquidator to seize the full collateral of the borrower (instead of 50%). 9",

Repaying the delta should involve both decreasing the scaledDelta as well as decreasing the scaledP2PAmount by the matched amount. [1] However, the scaledP2PAmount update is delayed until the end of the repay function. The following repayFee call then reads the un-updated market.deltas.borrow.scaledP2PAmount storage variable leading to a larger estimation of the P2P fees that can be repaid. The excess fee that is repaid will stay in the contract and not be accounted for, when it should have been used to promote borrowers, increase idle supply or demote suppliers. For example, there could now be P2P suppliers that should have been demoted but are not and in reality don't have any P2P counterparty, leaving the entire accounting system in a broken state.  Example (all values are in underlying amounts for brevity.) Imagine a borrow delta of 1000, borrow.scaledP2PTotal = 10,000 supply.scaledP2PTotal = 8,000, so the repayable fee should be (10,000 - 1000) - (8,000 - 0) = 1,000. Now a P2P borrower wants to repay 3000 debt: 1. Pool repay: no pool repay as they have no pool borrow balance. 2. Decrease p2p borrow delta: decreaseDelta is called which sets market.deltas.borrow.scaledDelta = 0 (but does not update market.deltas.borrow.scaledP2PAmount yet!) and returns matchedBorrowDelta = 1000 3. repayFee is called and it computes (10,000 - 0) - (8,000 - 1,000) = 2,000.

With the PR, the operation will proceed because the supply to the Aave pool is skipped (see PoolLib.supplyToPool). Allowing this scenario in this specific context for the supplyCollateralLogic function will bring the following side effects:  The supplied user's amount will remain in Morpho's contract and will not be supplied to the Aave pool.  The user's accounting system is not updated because collateralBalance is increased by amount.rayDivDown(poolSupplyIndex) which is equal to zero. 21  If the marketBalances.collateral[onBehalf] was equal to zero (the user has never supplied the underly- ing to Morpho) the underlying token would be wrongly added to the _userCollaterals[onBehalf] storage, even if the amount supplied to Morpho (and to Aave) is equal to zero.  The user will not be able to withdraw the provided amount because the amount has not been accounted for in the storage.  Events.CollateralSupplied event is emitted even if the amount (used as an event parameter) has not been accounted to the user.",

A similar issue exists in the withdraw() function but the minimum check on the pool holdings limits the attacks impact. Consider the following scenario (swap fees ignored for simplicity): 1.

The Treasury wants to add another 3k DAI into the Aera vault, so it calls the deposit() function. 3. The attacker front-runs the Treasurys transaction. They swap 3k DAI into the Balancer pool and get out 0.5 WETH. The weights remain 0.5 and 0.5, but because WETH and DAI balances become 0.5 and 6k, WETHs spot price now becomes 12k. 4. Now, the Treasurys transaction adds 3k DAI into the Balancer pool and upgrades the weights to 0.5*1.5: 0.5 = 0.6: 0.4. 5. The attacker back-runs the transaction and swaps the 0.5 WETH they got in step 3 back to DAI (and recovers the WETHs spot price to near but above 3k). According to the current weights, they can get 9k*(1 - 1/r) = 3.33k DAI from the pool, where r = (20.4)(1/0.6). 6. As a result the attacker profits 3.33k - 3k = 0.33k DAI.",

In the same transaction, reduce the swap fees to ~0 (0.0001% is the minimum) and arbitrage the vault. The proposed fix was to limit the percentage change of the swap fee to a maximum of MAXIMUM_SWAP_FEE_- PERCENT_CHANGE each time. However, because there is no restriction on how many times the setSwapFee function can be called in a block or transaction, a malicious manager can still call it multiple times in the same transaction and eventually set the swap fee to the value they want.",

The AeraVault is itself the only liquidity provider of the Balancer pool deployed, so each week its entitled to claim those rewards.

The notice period has passed and the Treasury calls finalize() on the Aera vault. Assume the Balancer pool contains 1 WETH and 3000 DAI, and that WETH and DAI weights are both 0.5. 2. An attacker front-runs the Treasurys transaction and swaps in 3000 DAI to get 0.5 WETH from the pool. 3. As an unexpected result, the Treasury receives 0.5 WETH and 6000 DAI. Therefore an attacker can force the Treasury to accept the trade that they offer. Although the Treasury can execute a reverse trade on another market to recover the token amount and distribution, not every Treasury can execute such trade (e.g., if a timelock controls it).

        "body": "The Aera Vault constructor has the role to handle Balancers ManagedPool deployment. The con- structor should increase the number of user input validation and the Gauntlet team should be aware of the possible edge case that could happen given that the deployment of the Aera Vault is handled directly by the Treasury and not by the Gauntlet team itself. We are going to list all the worst-case scenarios that could happen given the premise that the deployments are handled by the Treasury. 1. factory could be a wrapper contract that will deploy a ManagedPool. This would mean that the deployer could pass correct parameters to Aera Vault to pass these checks, but will use custom and malicious parameters on the factory wrapper to deploy the real Balancer pool. 2. swapFeePercentage value is not checked. On Balancer, the deployment will revert if the value is not in- side this range >= 1e12 (0.0001%) and <= 1e17 (10% - this fits in 64 bits). Without any check, the Gauntlet accept to follow the Balancers swap requirements. 3. manager_ is not checked. They could set the manager as the Treasury (owner of the vault) itself. This would give the Treasury the full power to manage the Vault. At least these values should be checked: address(0), address(this) or owner(). The same checks should also be done in the setManager() function. 4. validator_ could be set to a custom contract that will give full allowances to the Treasury. This would make the withdraw() act like finalize() allowing to withdraw all the funds from the vault/pool. 17 5. noticePeriod_ has only a max value check. Gauntlet team explained that a time delay between the ini- tialization of the finalize process and the actual finalize is needed to prevent the Treasury to be able to instantly withdraw all the funds. Not having a min value check allow the Treasury to set the value to 0 so there would be no delay between the initiateFinalization() and finalize() because noticeTimeoutAt == block.timestamp. 6. managementFee_ has no minimum value check. This would allow the Treasury to not pay the manager because the managerFeeIndex would always be 0. 7. description_ can be empty. From the Specification PDF, the description of the vault has the role to De- scribes vault purpose and modelling assumptions for differentiating between vaults. Being empty could lead to a bad UX for external services that needs to differentiate different vaults. These are all the checks that are done directly by Balancer during deployment via the Pool Factory:  BasePool constructor#L94-L95 min and max number of tokens.  BasePool constructor#L102token array is sorted following Balancer specification (sorted by token address).  BasePool constructor calling _setSwapFeePercentage min and max value for swapFeePercentage.  BasePool constructor calling vault.registerTokens token address uniqueness (cant have same Following the pathBasePool is calling from function _registerMinimalSwapInfoPoolTokens it also checks that token != IERC20(0). should that call token in the pool), vault.registerTokens MinimalSwapInfoPoolsBalance.  ManagedPool constructor calling _startGradualWeightChange Check min value of weight and that the total sum of the weights are equal to 100%. _startGradualWeightChange internally check that endWeight >= WeightedMath._MIN_WEIGHT and normalizedSum == FixedPoint.ONE.",

The owner calls updateAllowList but this time with new parameters, specifically a new Merkle root that is computed from leaves that have MintParams.feeBps == 0. 3. Users/minters use the generated proof corresponding to the latest allow list update and pass their mintParams.feeBps as 0. And thus avoiding the protocol fee deduction for the creatorPaymentAddress (SeaDrop.sol#L187-L194).",

This introduces the risk of cross contract re-entrancy that can be used to circumvent the maxMintsPerWallet check. Here's an example of the attack: 1. Consider an ERC721 token that that has two allowed SeaDrop, one that accepts ETH as payment and the other that accepts USDC as payment, both with public mints and restrictedFeeRecipients set to false. 2. Let maxMintPerWallet be 1 for both these cases. 3. A malicious fee receiver can now do the following:  Call mintPublic for the Seadrop with ETH fees, which does the _checkMintQuantity check and trans- fers the fees in ETH to the receiver.  The receiver now calls mintPublic for Seadrop with USDC fees, which does the _checkMintQuantity check that still passes.  The mint succeeds in the Seadrop-USDC case.  The mint succeeds in the Seadrop-ETH case.  The minter has 2 NFTs even though it's capped at 1. Even if a re-entrancy lock is added in the SeaDrop, the same issue persists as it only enters each Seadrop contract once.",

        "body": "Spearbit discovered that the functions verifying if a contract is a pair do so by only checking the rst 54 bytes (i.e. the Proxy code). An attacker could deploy a contract that starts with the rst 54 bytes of proxy code but have a malicious payload, and these functions will still verify it as a legitimate clone. We have found this to be a critical issue based on the feasibility of a potential exploit. Consider the following scenario: 1. An attacker creates a malicious pair by making a copy of the source of cloneETHPair() supplying malicious values for factory, bondingCurve, nft and poolType using a valid template for the connected contract. 2. The attacker has a contract with valid proxy code, connected to a valid template, but the rest of the parameters are invalid. 3. The Pair is initialized via a copy of initialize() of LSSVMPair, which calls __Ownable_init() to set a malicious owner. 4 4. The malicious owner calls call(), with target equal to the router contract and the calldata for the function pairTransferERC20From(): // Owner is set by pair creator function call(address payable target, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner { // Factory is malicious LSSVMPairFactoryLike _factory = factory(); // `callAllowed()` is malicious and returns true require(_factory.callAllowed(target), \"Target must be whitelisted\"); (bool result, ) = target.call{value: 0}(data); require(result, \"Call failed\"); ,! } 5. The check for onlyOwner and require pass, therefore pairTransferERC20From() is called with the malicious Pair as msg.sender. 6. The router checks if it is called from a valid pair via isPair(): function pairTransferERC20From(...) external { // Verify caller is a trusted pair contract // The malicious pair passed this test require(factory.isPair(msg.sender, variant), \"Not pair\"); ... token.safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount); } 7. Because the function isPair() only checks the rst 54 bytes (the runtime code including the implementation address), isPair() does not check for extra parameters factory, bondingCurve, nft or poolType: 5 function isPair(address potentialPair, PairVariant variant) ... { ... } else if (variant == PairVariant.ENUMERABLE_ETH) { return ,! LSSVMPairCloner.isETHPairClone(address(enumerableETHTemplate),potentialPair); } ... } function isETHPairClone(address implementation, address query) ... { ... // Compare expected bytecode with that of the queried contract let other := add(ptr, 0x40) extcodecopy(query, other, 0, 0x36) result := and( eq(mload(ptr), mload(other)), // Checks 32 + 22 = 54 bytes eq(mload(add(ptr, 0x16)), mload(add(other, 0x16))) ) } 8.

        "body": "For ZkSync chain, the msg.sender is preserved for L1 -> L2 calls. One of the rules when pursuing a cross-chain strategy is to never assume that address control between L1 and L2 is always guaranteed. For EOAs (i.e., non-contract accounts), this is generally true that any account that can be accessed on Ethereum will also be accessible on other EVM-based chains. However, this is not always true for contract-based accounts as the same account/wallet address might be owned by different persons on different chains. This might happen if there is a poorly implemented smart contract wallet factory on multiple EVM-based chains that deterministically deploys a wallet based on some user-defined inputs. For instance, if a smart contract wallet factory deployed on both EVM-based chains uses deterministic CREATE2 which allows users to define its salt when deploying the wallet, Bob might use ABC as salt in Ethereum and Alice might use ABC as salt in Zksync. Both of them will end up getting the same wallet address on two different chains. A similar issue occurred in the Optimism-Wintermute Hack, but the actual incident is more complicated. Assume that 0xABC is a smart contract wallet owned and deployed by Alice on ZkSync chain. Alice performs a xcall from Ethereum to ZkSync with delegate set to 0xABC address. Thus, on the destination chain (ZkSync), only Alice's smart contract wallet 0xABC is authorized to call functions protected by the onlyDelegate modifier. 11 Bob (attacker) saw that the 0xABC address is not owned by anyone on Ethereum. Therefore, he proceeds to take ownership of the 0xABC by interacting with the wallet factory to deploy a smart contract wallet on the same address on Ethereum. Bob can do so by checking out the inputs that Alice used to create the wallet previously. Thus, Bob can technically make a request from L1 -> L2 to impersonate Alice's wallet (0xABC) and bypass the onlyDelegate modifier on ZkSync. Additionally, Bob could make a L1 -> L2 request by calling the ZKSync's BridgeFacet.xcall directly to steal Alice's approved funds. Since the xcall relies on msg.sender, it will assume that the caller is Alice. This issue is only specific to ZkSync chain due to the preservation of msg.sender for L1 -> L2 calls. For the other chains, the msg.sender is not preserved for L1 -> L2 calls and will always point to the L2's AMB forwarding the requests.",

Instance 2 - Renouncing admin role All the contracts that extend from ProposedOwnableFacet inherit a method called revokeRole. 1.

Assume that a malicious user calls the permissionless GnosisSpokeConnector.send function 1000 times (or any number of times that will cause an Out-of-Gas error later) within a single transaction/block on Gnosis causing a large number of Gnosis's outboundRoots to be forwarded to GnosisHubConnector on Ethereum. 2. Since the 1000 outboundRoots were sent at the same transaction/block earlier, all of them should arrive at the GnosisHubConnector within the same block/transaction on Ethereum. 13 3. For each of the 1000 outboundRoots received, the GnosisHubConnector.processMessage function will be triggered to process it, which will in turn call the RootManager.aggregate function to add the received out- boundRoot into the pendingInboundRoots queue. As a result, 1000 outboundRoots with the same commit- Block will be added to the pendingInboundRoots queue. 4. After the delay period, the RootManager.propagate function will be triggered. The function will call the dequeueVerified function to dequeue 1000 verified outboundRoots from the pendingInboundRoots queue by looping through the queue. This might result in an Out-of-Gas error and cause a revert. 5. If the above dequeueVerified function does not revert, the RootManager.propagate function will attempt to insert 1000 verified outboundRoots to the aggregated Merkle tree, which might also result in an Out-of-Gas error and cause a revert. If the RootManager.propagate function reverts when called, the latest aggregated Merkle root cannot be forwarded to the spokes.

Since Multichain's hub and spoke connectors are unable to send messages, cross-chain messaging using Multichain within Connext will not work. 17 function _sendMessage(address _amb, bytes memory _data) internal { Multichain(_amb).anyCall( _amb, // Same address on every chain, using AMB as it is immutable _data, address(0), // fallback address on origin chain MIRROR_CHAIN_ID, 0 // fee paid on origin chain ); } Additionally, for the payment of the execution gas fee, a project can choose to implement either of the following methods:  Pay on the source chain by depositing the gas fee to the caller contracts.  Pay on the destination chain by depositing the gas fee to Multichain's anyCall contract at the destination chain. If Connext decides to pay the gas fee on the source chain, they would need to deposit some ETH to the connector contracts. However, it is not possible because no receive(), fallback or payable function has been implemented within the contracts and their parent contracts for accepting ETH.",

Although the comment mentioned that the setRouterRecipient should only be set once, this is not true because this function will only revert if the _- prevRecipient == recipient. As long as the new recipient is not the same as the previous recipient, the function will happily accept the new recipient. Therefore, if the router's signing key is compromised by Bob (attacker), he could call the setRouterRecipient function to change the new recipient to his personal EOA and drain the funds within the router. The setRouterRecipient function is protected by onlyRouterOwner modifier. Since Bob's has the compromised router's signing key, he will be able to pass this validation check. 21 /** File: RoutersFacet.sol 157: 158: 159: 160: 161: 162: 163: 164: 165: _; } * @notice Asserts caller is the router owner (if set) or the router itself */ modifier onlyRouterOwner(address _router) { address owner = s.routerPermissionInfo.routerOwners[_router]; if (!((owner == address(0) && msg.sender == _router) || owner == msg.sender)) revert RoutersFacet__onlyRouterOwner_notRouterOwner(); The second validation is at Line 404, which checks if the new recipient is not the same as the previous recipient. The recipient variable is set to Bob's EOA wallet, while _prevRecipient variable is set to Alice's second EOA (0x456). Therefore, the condition at Line 404 is False, and it will not revert. So Bob successfully set the recipient to his EOA at Line 407. File: RoutersFacet.sol 401: 402: 403: 404: 405: 406: 407: function setRouterRecipient(address router, address recipient) external onlyRouterOwner(router) { // Check recipient is changing address _prevRecipient = s.routerPermissionInfo.routerRecipients[router]; if (_prevRecipient == recipient) revert RoutersFacet__setRouterRecipient_notNewRecipient(); // Set new recipient s.routerPermissionInfo.routerRecipients[router] = recipient; Per the Github discussion, the motivation for such a design is the following: If a routers signing key is compromised, the attacker could drain the liquidity stored on the contract and send it to any specified address. This effectively means the key is in control of all unused liquidity on chain, which prevents router operators from adding large amounts of liquidity directly to the contract. Routers should be able to delegate the safe withdrawal address of any unused liquidity, creating a separation of concerns between router key and liquidity safety. In summary, the team is trying to create a separation of concerns between router key and liquidity safety. With the current implementation, there is no security benefit of segregating the router owner role and recipient role unless the router owner has been burned (e.g. set to address zero). Because once the router's signing key is compromised, the attacker can change the recipient anyway. The security benefits of separation of concerns will only be achieved if the recipient can truly be set only once.",

On the destination chain, nextUSDC (local bridge asset) will be swapped to POS-USDC (adopted asset). The swap will incur low slippage because it is a stablewap.

Next, Alice called the _claimRedeemRequest function with R1 and its corresponding W 1. The _claimRedeemRequest will first process W 1. At the end of the function, it will check if W 1 matches all the amounts of R1. If not, it will call the _claimRedeemRequest function recursively with the same request id (R1) but increment the withdrawal event id (W2 = W1 + 1). The _claimRedeemRequest function recursively calls itself until all the amount of redeem request is \"expended\" or the next withdrawal event does not exist. In the above example, the _claimRedeemRequest will be called 7 times with W1...W7, until all the amount of R1 is \"expended\" (R1.amount == 0) However, if the amount of a redeem request is large (e.g. 1000 LsETH), and this redeem request is satisfied by many small chunks of withdrawal events (e.g. one withdrawal event consists of less than 10 LsETH), then the recursion depth will be large. The function will keep calling itself recursively until an out-of-gas error happens. If this happens, there is no way to claim the redemption request, and the user's LsETH will be locked. In the current implementation, users cannot break the claim into smaller chunks to overcome the gas limit.

The function prioritizes liquidity sources, starting with Balance- ToRedeem and then BalanceToDeposit, before asking validators to exit. However, if the validators are needed to release more liquidity, the function uses pickNextValidatorsToExit to determine which validators to ask to exit. This process can be quite gas-intensive, especially if the number of validators is large. The gas consumption of this function depends on several factors, including exitableOperatorCount, stoppedVal- idators.length, and the rate of decrease of _count. These factors may increase over time, and the msg.sender does not have control over them. The function includes two nested loops that contribute to the overall gas con- sumption, and this can be problematic for certain inputs. For example, if the operators array has no duplications and the difference between values is exactly 1, such as [n, n-1, n-2 ... n-k] where n can be any number and k is a large number equals exitableOperatorCount - 1 and _count is also large, the function can become extremely gas-intensive. The main consequence of such a potential issue is that the function may not release enough liquidity to the RedeemManager contract, resulting in partial fulfillment of redemption requests. Similarly, _pickNextValidatorsToDepositFromActiveOperators is also very gas intensive. If the number of de- sired validators and current operators (including fundable operators) are high enough, depositToConsensusLayer is no longer callable.",

However, it was observed that the incentive mechanism might not work as expected in some instances. Consider the following scenario: Assuming an operator called A has 5 slashed validators and 0 exited validators, the _getStoppedValidator- CountAtIndex function will return 5 for A since this function takes into consideration both stopped and slashed validators. Also, assume that the requestedExits of A is 5, which means that A has been instructed by the protocol to submit 5 exit requests to CL. In this case, the incentive mechanism seems to diminish as A will still be considered a fundable operator even if A does not respond to exit requests since the number of slashed validators is enough to \"help\" to push up the stopped validator count to satisfy the condition, giving the wrong impression that A has already submitted the exit requests. As such, A will continue to be selected to stake new deposits.",

Because the FVM holds all tokens for all pools in the same contract, assumes that a contract address is a unique identifier for a token, and relies on the return value of balanceOf for manipulated tokens to determine what transfers are needed during transaction settlement, multiple entrypoint tokens are not safe to be used in pools. For example, suppose there is a pool with non-zero liquidity where one token has a second valid address. An attacker can atomically create a second pool using the alternate address, allocate liquidity, and then immediately deallocate it. During execution of the _settlement function, getNetBalance will return a positive net balance for the double entrypoint token, crediting the attacker and transferring them the entire balance of the double entrypoint token. This attack only costs gas, as the allocation and deallocation of non-double entrypoint tokens will cancel out.",

In particular, the liquidation function can be front-runned by the owner of the position by calling unwind. This effectively means that users can prevent themselves from getting liquidated by watching the mempool and frontrunning calls to their liquidation position by calling unwind. Although this behaviour is similar to liquidations in lending protocols where a borrower can front-run a liquidation by repaying the borrow, the lack of collateral requirements for both unwind and liquidation makes this case special. Note: In practice, transactions for liquidations do not end up in the public mempool and are often sent via private relays such as flashbots. Therefore, a scenario where the user finds out about a liquidatable position by the public mempool is likely not common. However, a similar argument still applies. Note: Overlay also allows the owner of the position to be the liquidator, unlike other protocols like compound. The difference in price computation for the liquidation and unwind mechanism may make it better for users to liquidate themselves rather than unwinding their position. However, a check similar to compound is not effective at preventing this issue since users can always liquidate themselves from another address.",

However, all of the chainlink mainnet floor price feeds have a heartbeat of 86400 seconds (24 hours), so the chainlink strategies will revert with the PriceNotRecentEnough error quite often. At the time of writing, every single mainnet floor price feed has an updateAt timestamp well over 3600 seconds in the past, meaning the strategy would always revert for any mainnet price feed right now. This may have not been realized earlier because the Goerli floor price feeds do have a heartbeat of 3600, but the mainnet heartbeat is much less frequent. One of the consequences is that users might miss out on exchanges they would have accepted. For example, if a taker bid is interested in a maker ask with an eth premium from the floor, in the likely scenario where the taker didn't log-in within 1 hour of the last oracle update, the strategy will revert and the exchange won't happen even though both parties are willing. If the floor moves up again the taker might not be interested anymore.

Even though the strategy is fixed by the maker (since the stratgeyId has been signed), the strategy's implementation might involve a complex logic that might allow (if the strategy colludes with the taker somehow) a derivative token (that is owned by / linked to the to-be-transferred token) to be reattached to another token (think of accessories for an NFT character token in a game). And so the value of the to-be-transferred token would be reduced in that sense. A maker would not be able to check for this linked derivative token ownership during the transaction since there is no post-transfer hook for the maker (except in one special case when the token involved is ERC1155 and the maker is a custom contract). Also, note that all the implemented strategies would not alter the state when they are called (their endpoints have a pure or a view visibility). There is an exception to this in the StrategyTestMultiFillCollectionOrder test contract.",

It can only fail when an ERC20 token is used for the trade but since contracts are whitelisted in the system and probably vetted by the team, it's safe to say it's less probable that the receiver will have the ability to revert the entire transaction, although it is possible for contracts that implement a transferAndCall pattern. However, there's still the issue of transactions being reverted due to blacklistings (which have become more popular in the last year). In order to better assess the risk let's elaborate more on the 4 potential recipients of a transaction: 1. affiliate - The risk can be easily mitigated by proper handling at the front-end level. If the transaction fails due to the affiliate's address, the taker can specify address(0) as the affiliate. 2. recipient - If the transaction fails due to the recipient's address, it can only impact the taker in a gas-griefing way. 3. protocol - If the transaction fails due to the protocol's address, its address might be updated by the contract owner in the worst case. 4. creator - If the transaction fails due to the creator's address it can not be changed directly, but in the worst case creatorFeeManager can be changed.",

This is in contrast to StrategyCollectionOffer strategy that allows an arbitrary amount (although also required to be only one amount, [a]) Currently, Chainlink only provides price feeds for a selected list of ERC721 collections: https://docs.chain.link/ data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses So, if there are no price feeds for ERC1155 (as of now), the transaction would revert. Thus implicitly one can deduce that the chainlink floor strategies are only implemented for ERC721 tokens. Other strategies condition the amounts based on the assetType: 38  assetType == 0 or ERC721 collections can only have 1 as a valid amount  assetType == 0 or ERC1155 collections can only have a non-zero number as a valid amount If in the future chainlink or another token-price-feed adds support for some ERC1155 collections, one cannot use the current floor strategies to fulfill an order with an amount greater than 1.",

So in this case, OL might add a new asset type with TransferManager.transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections.selector as the selector and this transfer manager as the manager. Now, since this operator/LooksRareProtocol (and possibly other future implementations of approved operators) uses the same list of parameters for all endpoints, when _transferNFT gets called, the transfer manager using the transferBatchItemsAcrossCollections endpoint but with the following encoded data: the protocol would call abi.encodeWithSelector( managerSelectorOfAssetType[assetType].selector, collection, sender, recipient, itemIds, amounts ) ) A crafty OL might try to take advantage of the parameter type mismatch to create a malicious payload (address, address, address, uint256[], uint256[] ) that when decoded as (address[], address[], address, address, uint256[][], uint256[][]) It would allow them to transfer any NFT tokens from any user to some specific users. ; interpreted paramters | original parameter ,! ; ---------------------------------- ,! -------- c Ma.s or msg.sender 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c0 ; collections.ptr 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100 ; assetTypes.ptr ,! 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000X3 ; from ,! 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000X4 ; to ,! itemIds.ptr -> 0xa0 Tb.r or Mb.s x 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000140 ; itemIds.ptr ,! amounts.ptr -> 0xc0 + 0x20 * itemIds.length 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c0 ; amounts.ptr ,! itemIds.length | collection | from / | to / | | | ; ; | itemIds[0] | itemIds[1] ...

This is a good since users who sign their MakerBid or MakerAsk can trustlessly examine the strategy implementation before including them into their orders. Some strategies might depend on other actors such as price feeds. This is the case for StrategyUSDDynamicAsk and StrategyFloorFromChainlink. If for some reason these price feeds do not return the correct prices, these strategies can have a slight deviation from their original intent. Case StrategyUSDDynamicAsk If the price feed returns a lower price, a taker can bid on an order with that lower price. This scenario is guarded by MakerAsk's minimum price. But the maker would not receive the expected amount if the correct price was reported and was greater than the maker's minimum ask. Case StrategyFloorFromChainlink For executeFixedDiscountCollectionOfferStrategyWithTakerAsk and executeBasisPointsDiscountCollec- tionOfferStrategyWithTakerAsk if the price feeds reports a floor price higher than the maker's maximum bid price, the taker can match with the maximum bid. Thus the maker ends up paying more than the actual floor adjusted by the discount formula. For executeFixedPremiumStrategyWithTakerBid and executeBasisPointsPremiumStrategyWithTakerBid if the price feeds report a floor price lower than the maker's minimum ask price, the taker can match with the minimum ask price and pay less than the actual floor price (adjusted by the premium).",

One of the differences is the processing of msg.value for native tokens, see pieces of code below. The implementation of SwapperV2.sol sends previously available native token to the msg.sender. The following is exploit example. Assume that:  the LiFi Diamond contract contains 0.1 ETH.  a call is done with msg.value == 1 ETH.  and _swapData[0].fromAmount ETH, which is the amount to be swapped. Option 1Swapper.sol: initialBalances == 1.1 ETH - 1 ETH == 0.1 ETH. Option 2 SwapperV2.sol: initialBalances == 1.1 ETH. After the swap getOwnBalance()is1.1 - 0.5 == 0.6 ETH. Option 1 Swapper.sol: returns 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5 ETH. Option 2 SwapperV2.sol: returns 0.6 ETH (so includes the previously present ETH). 0.5 == Note: the implementations of noLeftovers() are also different in Swapper.sol and SwapperV2.sol. Note: this is also related to the issue \"Pulling tokens by LibSwap.swap() is counterintuitive\", because the ERC20 are pulled in via LibSwap.swap(), whereas the msg.value is directly added to the balance. As there normally shouldnt be any token in the LiFi Diamond contract the risk is limited. contract Swapper is ILiFi { function _fetchBalances(...) ... { ... for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) { address asset = _swapData[i].receivingAssetId; uint256 balance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(asset); if (LibAsset.isNativeAsset(asset)) { balances[i] = balance - msg.value; } else { balances[i] = balance; } } return balances; } } contract SwapperV2 is ILiFi { function _fetchBalances(...) ... { ... for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) { balances[i] = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData[i].receivingAssetId); } ... } } The following functions do a comparable processing of msg.value for the initial balance:  swapAndCompleteBridgeTokensViaStargate() of Executor.sol  swapAndCompleteBridgeTokens() of Executor.sol  swapAndExecute() of Executor.sol  swapAndCompleteBridgeTokens() of XChainExecFacet 25 if (!LibAsset.isNativeAsset(transferredAssetId)) { ... } else { startingBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(transferredAssetId) - msg.value; } However in Executor.sol function swapAndCompleteBridgeTokensViaStargate() isnt optimal for ERC20 tokens because ERC20 tokens are already deposited in the contract before calling this function. function swapAndCompleteBridgeTokensViaStargate(... ) ... { ... if (!LibAsset.isNativeAsset(transferredAssetId)) { startingBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(transferredAssetId); // doesn't correct for initial balance } else { ... } ,! } So assume:  0.1 ETH was in the contract.  1 ETH was added by the bridge.  0.5 ETH is swapped. Then the StartingBalance is calculated to be 0.1 ETH + 1 ETH == 1.1 ETH. So no funds are returned to the receiver as the end balance is 1.1 ETH - 0.5 ETH == 0.6 ETH, is smaller than 1.1 ETH. Whereas this should have been (1.1 ETH - 0.5 ETH) - 0.1 ETH == 0.5 ETH.",

It also doesnt detect accidentally sending of native tokens with ERC20 tokens. This approach is counterintuitive and leads to risks. Suppose someone wants to swap 100 USDC to 100 DAI and then 100 DAI to 100 USDT. If the first swap somehow gives back less tokens, for example 90 DAI, then LibSwap.swap() pulls in 10 extra DAI from msg.sender. Note: this requires the msg.sender having given multiple allowances to the LiFi Diamond. Another risk is that an attacker tricks a user to sign a transaction for the LiFi protocol. Within one transaction it can sweep multiple tokens from the user, cleaning out his entire wallet. Note: this requires the msg.sender having given multiple allowances to the LiFi Diamond. In Executor.sol the tokens are already deposited, so the \"pull\" functionality is not needed and can even result in additional issues. In Executor.sol it tries to \"pull\" tokens from \"msg.sender\" itself. In the best case of ERC20 implementations (like OpenZeppeling, Solmate) this has no effect.

This applies if some conditions are true, but you can see them here function _moveVotingPower( address src, address dst, uint256 amount ) private { if (src != dst && amount > 0) { if (src != address(0)) { (uint256 oldWeight, uint256 newWeight) = _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[src], _subtract, ,! amount); emit DelegateVotesChanged(src, oldWeight, newWeight); } if (dst != address(0)) { (uint256 oldWeight, uint256 newWeight) = _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[dst], _add, amount); emit DelegateVotesChanged(dst, oldWeight, newWeight); } } } When a vesting schedule is created, the creator has two options: 1) Specify a custom delegatee different from the beneficiary (or equal to it, but it's the same as option 2). 2) Leave the delegatee empty (equal to address(0)).  Scenario 1) empty delegatee OR delegatee === beneficiary (same thing) After creating the vesting schedule, the voting power of the beneficiary will be equal to the amount of tokens vested. If the beneficiary did not call tlc.delegate(beneficiary) previously, after releasing some tokens, its voting power will be decreased by the amount of released tokens. 23  Scenario 2) delegatee !== beneficiary && delegatee !== address(0) Same thing as before, but now we have two different actors, one is the beneficiary and another one is the delegatee of the voting power of the vested tokens. If the beneficiary did not call tlc.delegate(vestingScheduleDelegatee) previously, after releasing some to- kens, the voting power of the current vested schedule's delegatee will be decreased by the amount of released tokens.

Under this situation the following issues can occur:  Someone who has already claimed might be able to claim again.  Someone who has already claimed has too much.  Someone who has already claimed has too little, and cannot longer claim the rest because _setClaimed() has already been set.  someone who has not yet claimed might not be able to claim because _setClaimed() has already been set by another user.

This creates a position on Aave for Morpho The ETH price crashes and the position becomes liquidatable. A liquidator liquidates the position on Aave, earning the liquidation bonus.

        "body": "Users on the pool currently earn a much worse rate than users with P2P credit lines. There's a queue for being connected P2P. As this queue could not be fully processed in a single transaction the protocol introduces the concept of a max iteration count and a borrower/supplier \"delta\" (c.f. yellow paper). This delta leads to a worse rate for existing P2P users. An attacker can force a delta to be introduced, leading to worse rates than before. Example: Imagine some borrowers are matched P2P (earning a low borrow rate), and many are still on the pool and therefore in the pool queue (earning a worse borrow rate from Aave).  An attacker supplies a huge amount, creating a P2P credit line for every borrower. (They can repeat this step several times if the max iterations limit is reached.) 7  The attacker immediately withdraws the supplied amount again. The protocol now attempts to demote the borrowers and reconnect them to the pool. But the algorithm performs a \"hard withdraw\" as the last step if it reaches the max iteration limit, creating a borrower delta. These are funds borrowed from the pool (at a higher borrowing rate) that are still wrongly recorded to be in a P2P position for some borrowers. This increase in borrowing rate is socialized equally among all P2P borrowers. (reflected in an updated p2pBorrowRate as the shareOfDelta increased.)  The initial P2P borrowers earn a worse rate than before. If the borrower delta is large, it's close to the on-pool rate.  If an attacker-controlled borrower account was newly matched P2P and not properly reconnected to the pool (in the \"demote borrowers\" step of the algorithm), they will earn a better P2P rate than the on-pool rate they earned before.",

Morpho does not check this threshold and could allow users to borrow on the P2P side (avoiding the revert because it would not trigger the underlying compound borrow action). Morpho should anyway monitor the borrowCaps of the market because it could make increaseP2PDeltasLogic and _unsafeWithdrawLogic reverts.  Both Morpho and Compound do not check if a market is in \"deprecated\" state. This means that as soon as a user borrows some tokens, he/she can be instantly liquidated by another user.  If the flag is true on Compound, the Morpho User can be liquidated directly on compound.  If the flag is true on Morpho, the borrower can be liquidated on Morpho.

Technically, an attacker could even force no liquidity on the pool by frontrunning liquidations by borrowing the entire pool amount - preventing them from being liquidated on Morpho.

The im- plementation only correctly sorts _maxSortedUsers / 2 instead of the expected _maxSortedUsers.

This is done because a naive implementation that would insert new values at _maxSortedUsers (once the heap is full) and shift them up, then decrease the size to _maxSortedUsers - 1 again, would end up concentrating all new values on the same single path from the leaf to the root node. Cutting off the last level of nodes of the heap is a heuristic to remove low-value nodes (because of the heap property) while at the same time letting new values be shifted up from different leaf locations. In the end, the goal this tries to achieve is that more high-value nodes are stored in the heap and can be used for the matching engine.",

Test example showcasing the issue: contract Useless { // A contract that have no functions // No fallback functions // Will not accept ETH (only from selfdestruct/coinbase) } function test_transactorCALL() public { Useless useless = new Useless(); bool success; vm.deal(deployer, 3 ether); vm.deal(address(drippie), 0 ether); vm.deal(address(useless), 0 ether); vm.prank(deployer); // send 1 ether via `call` to a contract that cannot receive them 8 (success, ) = drippie.CALL{value: 1 ether}(address(useless), \"\", 100000, 1 ether); assertEq(success, false); vm.prank(deployer); // Perform a `call` to a not existing target's function (success, ) = drippie.CALL{value: 1 ether}(address(useless), abi.encodeWithSignature(\"notExistingFn()\"), 100000, 1 ether); assertEq(success, false); assertEq(deployer.balance, 1 ether); assertEq(address(drippie).balance, 2 ether); assertEq(address(useless).balance, 0); ,! } function test_transactorDELEGATECALL() public { Useless useless = new Useless(); bool success; vm.deal(deployer, 3 ether); vm.deal(address(drippie), 0 ether); vm.deal(address(useless), 0 ether); vm.prank(deployer); // send 1 ether via `delegatecall` to a contract that cannot receive them (success, ) = drippie.DELEGATECALL{value: 1 ether}(address(useless), \"\", 100000); assertEq(success, false); vm.prank(deployer); // Perform a `delegatecall` to a not existing target's function (success, ) = drippie.DELEGATECALL{value: 1 ether}(address(useless), abi.encodeWithSignature(\"notExistingFn()\"), 100000); assertEq(success, false); assertEq(deployer.balance, 1 ether); assertEq(address(drippie).balance, 2 ether); assertEq(address(useless).balance, 0); ,! }",

        "body": "The Transactor contract contains a \"general purpose\" DELEGATECALL function that allow the owner to execute a delegatecall toward a target address passing an arbitrary payload. Consider the following scenarios:  Scenario 1 A malicious target contract could selfdestruct the Transactor contract and as a consequence the contract that is inheriting from Transactor. Test example showcasing the issue: 9 contract SelfDestroyer { function destroy(address receiver) external { selfdestruct(payable(receiver)); } } function test_canOwnerSelftDestructDrippie() public { // Assert that Drippie exist assertStatus(DEFAULT_DRIP_NAME, Drippie.DripStatus.PAUSED); assertGt(getContractSize(address(drippie)), 0); // set it to active vm.prank(deployer); drippie.status(DEFAULT_DRIP_NAME, Drippie.DripStatus.ACTIVE); assertStatus(DEFAULT_DRIP_NAME, Drippie.DripStatus.ACTIVE); // fund the drippie with 1 ETH vm.deal(address(drippie), 1 ether); uint256 deployerBalanceBefore = deployer.balance; uint256 drippieBalanceBefore = address(drippie).balance; // deploy the destroyer SelfDestroyer selfDestroyer = new SelfDestroyer(); vm.prank(deployer); drippie.DELEGATECALL(address(selfDestroyer), abi.encodeWithSignature(\"destroy(address)\", deployer), gasleft()); ,! uint256 deployerBalanceAfter = deployer.balance; uint256 drippieBalanceAfter = address(drippie).balance; // assert that the deployer has received the balance that was present in Drippie assertEq(deployerBalanceAfter, deployerBalanceBefore + drippieBalanceBefore); assertEq(drippieBalanceAfter, 0); // Weird things happens with forge // Because we are in the same block the code of the contract is still > 0 so // Cannot use assertEq(getContractSize(address(drippie)), 0); // Known forge issue // 1) Forge resets storage var to 0 after self-destruct (before tx ends) 2654 -> https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2654 // 2) selfdestruct has no effect in test 1543 -> https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/1543 assertStatus(DEFAULT_DRIP_NAME, Drippie.DripStatus.PAUSED); ,! }  Scenario 2 The delegatecall allows the owner to intentionally, or accidentally, overwrite the content of the drips mapping. By being able to modify the drips mapping, a malicious user would be able to execute a series of actions like: Changing drips status:  Activating an archived drip  Deleting a drip by changing the status to NONE (this allows the owner to override entirely the drip by calling again create)  Switching an active/paused drip to paused/active 10  etc.. Change drips interval:  Prevent a drip from being executed any more by setting interval to a very high value  Allow a drip to be executed more frequently by lowering the interval value  Enable reentrancy by setting interval to 0 Change drips actions:  Override an action to send drips contract balance to an arbitrary address  etc.. Test example showcasing the issue: contract ChangeDrip { address public owner; mapping(string => Drippie.DripState) public drips; function someInnocentFunction() external { drips[\"FUND_BRIDGE_WALLET\"].config.actions[0] = Drippie.DripAction({ target: payable(address(1024)), data: new bytes(0), value: 1 ether }); } } 11 function test_canDELEGATECALLAllowReplaceAction() public { vm.deal(address(drippie), 10 ether); vm.deal(address(attacker), 0 ether); // Create an action with name \"FUND_BRIDGE_WALLET\" that have the function // To fund a wallet vm.startPrank(deployer); string memory fundBridgeWalletName = \"FUND_BRIDGE_WALLET\"; Drippie.DripAction[] memory actions = new Drippie.DripAction[](1); // The first action will send Bob 1 ether actions[0] = Drippie.DripAction({ target: payable(address(alice)), data: new bytes(0), value: 1 ether ,! }); Drippie.DripConfig memory config = createConfig(100, IDripCheck(address(checkTrue)), new bytes(0), actions); drippie.create(fundBridgeWalletName, config); drippie.status(fundBridgeWalletName, Drippie.DripStatus.ACTIVE); vm.stopPrank(); // Deploy the malicius contract vm.prank(attacker); ChangeDrip changeDripContract = new ChangeDrip(); // make the owner of drippie call via DELEGATECALL an innocentfunction of the exploiter contract vm.prank(deployer); drippie.DELEGATECALL(address(changeDripContract), abi.encodeWithSignature(\"someInnocentFunction()\"), 1000000); ,! // Now the drip action should have changed, anyone can execute it and funds would be sent to // the attacker and not to the bridge wallet drippie.drip(fundBridgeWalletName); // Assert we have drained Drippie assertEq(attacker.balance, 1 ether); assertEq(address(drippie).balance, 9 ether); }  Scenario 3 Calling a malicious contract or accidentally calling a contract which does not account for Drippies storage layout can result in owner being overwritten. Test example showcasing the issue: contract GainOwnership { address public owner; function someInnocentFunction() external { owner = address(1024); } } 12 function test_canDELEGATECALLAllowOwnerLoseOwnership() public { vm.deal(address(drippie), 10 ether); vm.deal(address(attacker), 0 ether); // Deploy the malicius contract vm.prank(attacker); GainOwnership gainOwnershipContract = new GainOwnership(); // make the owner of drippie call via DELEGATECALL an innocentfunction of the exploiter contract vm.prank(deployer); drippie.DELEGATECALL(address(gainOwnershipContract), abi.encodeWithSignature(\"someInnocentFunction()\"), 1000000); ,! // Assert that the attacker has gained onwership assertEq(drippie.owner(), attacker); // Steal all the funds vm.prank(attacker); drippie.withdrawETH(payable(attacker)); // Assert we have drained Drippie assertEq(attacker.balance, 10 ether); assertEq(address(drippie).balance, 0 ether); }",

Consideration 1: Drips could be executed as soon as created Depending on the value set to state.config.interval the executables logic implies that as soon as a drip is created, the drip can be immediately (even in the same transaction) executed via the drip function.  Consideration 2: A very high value for interval could make the drip never executable block.timestamp represents the number of seconds that passed since Unix Time (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). When the owner of the Drippie want to create a \"one shot\" drip that can be executed immediately after creation but only once (even if the owner forgets to set the drips status to ARCHIVED) he/she should be aware that the max value that he/she can use for the interval is at max block.timestamp. This mean that the second time the drip can be executed is after block.timestamp seconds have been passed.

        "body": "The current implementation of removeMember is introducing an exploit that allows an oracle member to vote again and again (in the same epoch) and an oracle that has never voted is prevented from voting (in the same epoch). Because of how OracleMembers.deleteItem is implemented, it will swap the last item of the array with the one that will be deleted and pop the last element. Let's make an example: 1) At T0 m0 to the list of members  members[0] = m0. 2) At T1 m1 to the list of members  members[1] = m1. 3) At T3 m0 call reportBeacon(...). By doing that, ReportsPositions.register(uint256(0)); will be called, registering that the member at index 0 has registered the vote. 4) At T4, the oracle admin call removeMember(m0). This operation, as we said, will swap the member's address from the last position of the array of members with the position of the member that will be deleted. After doing that will pop the last position of the array. The state changes from members[0] = m0; members[1] = m1 to members[0] = m1;. At this point, the oracle member m1 will not be able to vote during this epoch because when he/she will call reportBeacon(...) the function will enter inside the check. if (ReportsPositions.get(uint256(memberIndex))) { revert AlreadyReported(_epochId, msg.sender); } This is because int256 memberIndex = OracleMembers.indexOf(msg.sender); will return 0 (the position of the m0 member that have already voted) and ReportsPositions.get(uint256(0)) will return true. At this point, if for whatever reason an admin of the contract add again the deleted oracle, it would be added to the position 1 of the array of the members, allowing the same member that have already voted, to vote again. Note: while the scenario where a removed member can vote multiple time would involve a corrupted admin (that would re-add the same member) the second scenario that prevent a user to vote would be more common.

To get the full amount back, the user needs to mint more wlsETH tokens so that we can find an exact solution to v = bx S B c. The extra amount to get the locked-up fees back can be engineered. The same problem exists for transfer and transferFrom. Also note, if you have minted x amount of shares, the balanceOf would tell you that you own b = b xB S c wlsETH. Internally wlsETH keeps track of the shares x. So users think they can only burn b amount, plug that in for the _value and in this case, the number of shares burnt would be b xB S cS B % $ which has even more rounding errors. wlsETH could internally track the underlying but that would not appropriate value like lsETH, which would basically be kind of wETH. We think the issue of not being able to transfer your full amount of shares is not as serious as not being able to burn back your shares into lsETH. On the same note, we think it would be beneficial to expose the wlsETH share amount to the end user: function sharesBalanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 shares) { return BalanceOf.get(_owner); }",

The implementation of the function should favor operators that have the highest number of available validators to be funded. Nevertheless functions favor validators that have stopped value near the funded value. Consider the following example: Op at index 0 name op1 active true limit 10 funded 5 stopped 5 keys 10 Op at index 1 name op2 active true limit 10 funded 0 stopped 0 keys 10 1) op1 and op2 have 10 validators whitelisted. 2) op1 at time1 get 5 validators funded. 3) op1 at time2 get those 5 validators exited, this mean that op.stopped == 5. In this scenario, those 5 validators would not be used because they are \"blacklisted\". At this point  op1 have 5 validators that can be funded. 24  op2 have 10 validators that can be funded. pickNextValidators logic should favor operators that have the higher number of available keys (not funded but approved) to be funded. If we run operatorsRegistry.pickNextValidators(5); the result is this Op at index 0 name op1 active true limit 10 funded 10 stopped 5 keys 10 Op at index 1 name op2 active true limit 10 funded 0 stopped 0 keys 10 Op1 gets all the remaining 5 validators funded, the function (from the specification of the logic) should instead have picked Op2.

More specifically, In case old- TotalAssetBalance() is greater than _underlyingAssetValue * _totalSupply(), then the number of shares the depositor receives will be 0, although _underlyingAssetValue will be still pulled from the depositors balance. An attacker with access to enough liquidity and to the mem-pool data can spot a call to UserDepositManagerV1._- deposit and front-run it by sending at least totalSupplyBefore * (_underlyingAssetValue - 1) + 1 wei to the contract . This way, the victim will get 0 shares, but _underlyingAssetValue will still be pulled from its account balance. In this case, the attacker does not necessarily have to be a whitelisted user, and it is important to mention that the funds that were sent by him can not be directly claimed back, rather, they will increase the price of the share. The attack vector mentioned above is the general front runner case, the most profitable attack vector will be the case where the attacker is able to determine the share price (for instance if the attacker mints the first share). In this scenario, the attacker will need to send at least attackerShares * (_underlyingAssetValue - 1) + 1 to the contract, (attackerShares is completely controlled by the attacker, and thus can be 1).

        "body": "At the time of writing this issue in the latest commit at 030b52feb5af2dd2ad23da0d512c5b0e55eb8259, in the natspec docs of OracleMembers there is a @dev comment that says @dev There can only be up to 256 oracle members. This is due to how report statuses are stored in Reports Positions If we look at ReportsPositions.sol the natspec docs explains that Each bit in the stored uint256 value tells if the member at a given index has reported But both Oracle.addMember and OracleMembers.push do not prevent the admin to add more than 256 items to the list of oracle members. If we look at the result of the test (located in Appendix), we can see that:  It's possible to add more than 256 oracle members.  The result of oracle.getMemberReportStatus(oracleMember257) return true even if the oracle member has not reported yet.  Because of that, oracle.reportConsensusLayerData (executed by oracleMember257) reverts correctly.  If we remove a member from the list (for example oracle member with index 1) the oracleMember257 it will be able to vote because will be swapped with the removed member and at oracle.getMemberReportStatus(oracleMember257) return false. this point 45",

Let's make an example: we have 10 operators with 1k validators each at the start of a frame. At some point during the very end of the frame validato_10 get approved 9k validators and all of them get funded. Those validators only participated a small fraction in the production of the rewards. But because there's no way to track these timing and because oracles do not know anything about these (they just need to report the balance and the number of validators during the frame) they will report and arrive to a quorum of reportBeacon(correctEpoch, correctAmountOfBalance, 21_000) that will trigger the OracleManagerV1.setBeaconData. The contract check that 21_000 > DepositedValidatorCount.get() will pass and _onEarnings is called. Let's not consider the math involved in the process of calculating the number of shares to be distributed based on the staked balance delta, let's say that because of all the increase in capital Alluvial will call _rewardOperators(1_- 000_000); distributing 1_000_000 shares to operators based on the number of validators that produced that reward. Because as we said we do not know how much each validator has contributed, those shares will be contributed in the same way to operators that could have not contributed at all to the epoch. This is true for both scenarios where validators that have joined or exited the beacon chain not at the start of the epoch where the last quorum was set.",

Let's assume that members arrived to a quorum for epochId_X. When quorum is reached, _pushToRiver is called, and it will update the following properties:  clean all the storage used for member reporting.  set ExpectedEpochId to epochId_X + 255.  set LastEpochId to epochId_X. With this context, let's assume that members decide to wait 30 frames (30 days) or that for 30 days they cannot arrive at quorum. At the new time, the new epoch would be epochId_X + 255 * 30 The following scenarios can happen:  1) Report at once all the missed epochs Instead of reporting only the current epoch (epochId_X + 255 * 30), they will report all the previous \"skipped\" epochs that are in the past. In this scenario, ExpectedEpochId contains the number of the expected next epoch assigned 30 days ago from the previous call to _pushToRiver. In reportBeacon if the _epochId is what the system expect (equal to Expect- edEpochId) the report can go on. So to be able to report all the missing reports of the \"skipped\" frames the member just need to call in a se- quence reportBeacon(epochId_X + 255, ...), reportBeacon(epochId_X + 255 + 255, ...) + .... + report- Beacon(epochId_X + 255 * 30, ...)  2) Report only the last epoch In this scenario, they would call directly reportBeacon(epochId_X + 255 * 30, ...). _pushToRiver call _sani- tyChecks to perform some checks as do not allow changes in the amount of staked ether that are below or above some bounds. The call that would be made is _sanityChecks(oracleReportedStakedBalance, prevTotalEth, timeElapsed) where timeElapsed is calculated as uint256 timeElapsed = (_epochId - LastEpochId.get()) * _beacon- Spec.slotsPerEpoch * _beaconSpec.secondsPerSlot; So, time elapsed is the number of seconds between the reported epoch and the LastEpochId. But in this scenario, LastEpochId has the old value from the previous call to _pushToRiver made 30 days ago that will be epochId_X. Because of this, the check made inside _sanityChecks for the upper bound would be more relaxed, allowing a wider spread between oracleReportedStakedBalance and prevTotalEth",

But if you take a look at _onTransfer: function _onTransfer(address _from, address _to) internal view override { IAllowlistV1(AllowlistAddress.get()).onlyAllowed(_from, TRANSFER_MASK); // this call reverts if unauthorized or denied IAllowlistV1(AllowlistAddress.get()).onlyAllowed(_to, TRANSFER_MASK); // this call reverts if unauthorized or denied ,! ,! } This would translate into calling onlyAllowed with the: IAllowlistV1(AllowlistAddress.get()).onlyAllowed(x, 0); Now if we look at the onlyAllowed function with these parameters: function onlyAllowed(x, 0) external view { uint256 userPermissions = Allowlist.get(x); if (userPermissions & DENY_MASK == DENY_MASK) { revert Denied(_account); } if (userPermissions & 0 != 0) { // <--- ( x & 0 != 0 ) == false revert Unauthorized(_account); } } Thus if the _from, _to addresses don't have their DENY_MASK set to 1 they would not trigger a revert since we would never step into the 2nd if block above when TRANSFER_MASK is passed to these functions. The TRANSFER_MASK is also used in _onDeposit: IAllowlistV1(AllowlistAddress.get()).onlyAllowed(_depositor, DEPOSIT_MASK + TRANSFER_MASK); // DEPOSIT_MASK + TRANSFER_MASK == DEPOSIT_MASK ,! IAllowlistV1(AllowlistAddress.get()).onlyAllowed(_recipient, TRANSFER_MASK); // like above in ,! `_onTransfer`",

The issue with this implementation is that it is not considering the case where all the operator's validators are already approved by Alluvial. In this case, if an operator removes the validator with the lower index, all the other validators get de-approved because the limit will be set to the lower limit. Consider this scenario: 59 op.limit = 10 op.keys = 10 op.funded = 0 This mean that all the validators added by the operator have been approved by Alluvial and are safe (keys == limit). If the operator or Alluvial call removeValidators([validatorIndex], [0]) removing the validator at index 0 this will  swap the validator_10 with validator_0.  set the limit to 0 because 0 < 10 (_indexes[_indexes.length - 1] < operator.limit). The consequence is that even if all the validators present before calling removeValidators were \"safe\" (because approved by Alluvial) the limit is now 0 meaning that all the validators are not \"safe\" anymore and cannot be selected by pickNextValidators.",

Oracle.1.sol#L284-L289 Update the reportBeacon natspec documentation about the _beaconValidators parameter to avoid further con- fusion. Client answer to the PR comment The docs should be updated to also reflect our plans for the Shanghai fork. Basically we can't just have the same behavior for a negative delta in validator count than with a positive delta (where we just assume that each validator that was in the queue only had 32 eth). Now when we exit validator we need to know how much was exited in order to compute the proper revenue value for the treasury and operator fee. This probably means that there will be an extra arg with the oracle to keep track of the exited eth value. But as long as the spec is not final, we'll stick to the validator count always growing. We should definitely add a custom error to explain that in case a report provides a smaller validator count.",

Although the onlyBridgeRouter modifier checks that the call originates from another BridgeRouter (assuming a correct configuration of the whitelist) to the onReceive() function, it does not check that the call originates from another Connext Diamond. Therefore, allowing anyone to send arbitrary data to BridgeRouter.sendToHook(), which is later interpreted as the transferId on Connexts NomadFacet.sol contract. This can be abused by a front-running attack as described in the following scenario:  Alice is a bridge user and makes an honest call to transfer funds over to the destination chain.  Bob does not make a transfer but instead calls the sendToHook() function with the same _extraData but passes an _amount of 1 wei.  Both Alice and Bob have their tokens debited on the source chain and must wait for the Nomad protocol to optimistically verify incoming TransferToHook messages.  Once the messages have been replicated onto the destination chain, Bob processes the message before Alice, causing onReceive() to be called on the same transferId.  However, because _amount is not verified against the transferId, Alice receives significantly less tokens and the s.reconciledTransfers mapping marks the transfer as reconciled. Hence, Alice has effectively lost all her tokens during an attempt to bridge them. function onReceive( uint32, // _origin, not used uint32, // _tokenDomain, not used bytes32, // _tokenAddress, of canonical token, not used address _localToken, uint256 _amount, bytes memory _extraData ) external onlyBridgeRouter { bytes32 transferId = bytes32(_extraData); // Ensure the transaction has not already been handled (i.e. previously reconciled). if (s.reconciledTransfers[transferId]) { revert NomadFacet__reconcile_alreadyReconciled(); } // Mark the transfer as reconciled. s.reconciledTransfers[transferId] = true; Note: the same issues exists with _localToken.

The process for receiving unbacked debt is as follows:  During message execution, the protocol checks if a single liquidity provider has bid on a liquidity auction which is handled by the relayer network.  If the provider has insufficient liquidity, the protocol attempts to utilize AAVE unbacked debt by minting uncol- lateralised aTokens and withdrawing them from the pool. The withdrawn amount is immediately used to pay out the recipient of the bridge transfer.  Currently the debt is fixed fee, see arc-whitelist-connext-for-v3-portals, however this might be changed in the future out of band.  Incase this would be changed: upon repayment, AAVE will actually expect unbackedDebt + fee + aToken interest. The current implementation will only track unbackedDebt + fee, hence, the protocol will accrue bad debt in the form of interest. Eventually, the extent of this bad debt will reach a point where the unbacked- MintCap has been reached and noone is able to pay off this debt. I consider this to be a long-term issue that could be handled in a future upgrade, however, it is important to highlight and address these issues early.",

We have a pool where the attacker is all of the liquidity (107 of each token) 2. A LP tries to deposit another 106 in equal proportions 3. The attacker uses a swap of 5 (cid:3) 106 of one of the tokens to distort the pool. They lose about 155k in the process, but the LP loses far more, nearly all of which goes to the attacker--about 615,324 (sum of the losses of the two tokens since they're equally priced in this example). The attacker could be a significantly smaller proportion of the pool and still find this attack profitable. They could also JIT the liquidity since the early withdrawal penalty has been removed. The attack becomes infeasible for very large pools (has to happen over multiple TXs so can't flash loan --need own capital), but is relevant in practice.",

        "body": "This TWAMM implementation tracks the proceeds of long-term swaps efficiently via accumulated values called \"scaled proceeds\" for each token. In every order block interval (OBI), the scaled proceeds for e.g. the sale of token 0 are incremented by (quantity of token 1 purchased during the OBI) (cid:3)264= (sales rate of token 0 during the OBI) Then the proceeds of any specific long-term swap can be computed as the product of the difference between the scaled proceeds at the current block (or the expiration block of the order if filled) and the last block for which proceeds were claimed for the order and the order's sales rate, divided by 264: last := min(currentBlock, orderExpiryBlock) prev := block of last proceeds collection, or block order was placed in if this is the first withdrawal LT swap proceeds = (scaledProceedsl ast (cid:0) scaledProceedsprev ) (cid:3) (ordersalesrate)=264 The value 264 is referred to as the \"scaling factor\" and is intended to reduce precision loss in the division to determine the increment to the scaled proceeds. The addition to increment the scaled proceeds and the subtraction to compute its net change is both intentionally done with unchecked arithmetic--since only the difference matters, so long as at most one overflow occurs between claim-of-proceeds events for any given order, the computed proceeds will be correct (up to rounding errors). If two or more overflows occur, however, funds will be lost by the swapper (unclaimable and locked in the contract). Additionally, to cut down on gas costs, the scaled proceeds for the two tokens are packed into a single storage slot, so that only 128 bits are available for each value. This makes multiple overflows within the lifetime of a single order more likely. The CronFi team was aware of this at the start of the audit and specifically requested it be investigated, though they expected a maximum order length of 5 years to be sufficient to avoid the issue in practice. The scaling factor of 264 is approximately 1.8 (cid:3) 1019, close to the unit size of an 18-decimal token. It indeed works well if both pool tokens have similar decimals and relative prices that do not differ by too many orders of magnitude, as the quantity purchased and the sales rate will then be of similar magnitude, canceling to within a few powers of ten (2128 3.4 (cid:3) 1038, leaving around 19 orders of magnitude after accounting for the scaling factor). However, in pools with large disparities in price, decimals, or both, numerical issues are easy to encounter. The most extreme, realistic example would be a DAI-GUSD pool. DAI has 18 decimals while GUSD has only 2. We will treat the price of DAI and GUSD as equal for this analysis, as they are both stablecoins, and arbitrage of the TWAMM pool should prevent large deviations. Selling GUSD at a rate of 1000 per block, with an OBI of 64 (the stable pool order block interval in the audited commit) results in an increment of the scaled proceeds per OBI of: increment = (64 (cid:3) 1000 (cid:3) 1018) (cid:3) 264=(1000 (cid:3) 102) = 1.18 (cid:3) 1037 7 This will overflow an unsigned 128 bit integer after 29 OBIs; at 12 seconds per block, this means the first overflow occurs after 12 (cid:3) 64 (cid:3) 29 = 22272 seconds or about 6.2 hours, and thus the first double overflow (and hence irrevocable loss of proceeds if a withdrawal is not executed in time) will occur within about 12.4 hours (slightly but not meaningfully longer if the price is pushed a bit below 1:1, assuming a deep enough pool or reasonably efficient arbitrage). Since the TWAMM is intended to support swaps that take days, weeks, months, or even years to fill, without requiring constant vigilance from every long-term swapper, this is a strong violation of safety. A less extreme but more market-relevant example would be a DAI-WBTC pool. WBTC has 8 instead of 2 decimals, but it is also more than four orders of magnitude more valuable per token than DAI, making it only about 2 orders of magnitude \"safer\" than a DAI-GUSD pool. Imitating the above calculation with 20_000 DAI = 1 WBTC and selling 0.0025 WBTC (~$50) per block with a 257 block OBI yields: increment = (257 (cid:3) 50 (cid:3) 1018) (cid:3) 264=(0.0025 (cid:3) 108) = 9.48 (cid:3) 1035 OBI to overflow = ceiling(2128=(9.48 (cid:3) 1035)) = 359 time to overflow = 12 (cid:3) 257 (cid:3) 359 = 1107156 seconds = 307 hours = 12.8 days , or a little more than a day to encounter the second overflow. While less bad than the DAI-GUSD example, this is still likely of significant concern given that the CronFi team indicated these are parameters under which the TWAMM should be able to function safely and DAI-WBTC is a pair of interest for the v1 product. It is worth noting that these calculations are not directly dependent on the quantity being sold so long as the price stays roughly constant--any change in the selling rate will be compensated by a proportional change in the proceeds quantity as their ratio is determined by price. Thus the analysis depends only on relative price and relative decimals, to a good approximation--so a WBTC-DAI pool can be expected to experience an overflow roughly every two weeks at prevailing market prices, so long as the net selling rate is non-zero.",

        "body": "An attacker can block any address from minting BLP Tokens. This occurs due to the MAX_JOIN_- EVENTS limit, which is present in the JoinEventLib library. The goal for an attacker is to block a legitimate user from minting BLP Tokens, by filling the joinEventMap mapping. The attacker can fill the joinEventMap mapping by performing the following steps:  The attacker mints BLP Tokens from 50 different addresses.  Each address transfers the BLP Tokens, alongside the join events, to the user targeted with a call to the CronV1Pool(pool).transfer and CronV1Pool(pool).transferJoinEvent functions respectively. Those transfers should happen in different blocks. After 50 blocks (50 * 12s = 10 minutes) the attacker has blocked the legitimate user from minting _BLP Tokens_, as the maximum size of the joinEventMap mapping has been reached. 8 The impact of this vulnerability can be significant, particularly for smart contracts that allow users to earn yield by providing liquidity in third-party protocols. For example, if a governance proposal is initiated to generate yield by providing liquidity in a CronV1Pool pool, the attacker could prevent the third-party protocol from integrating with the CronV1Pool protocol.

An example can be seen in onJoinPool uint256 token0InU112 = amountsInU112[TOKEN0_IDX]; uint256 token1InU112 = amountsInU112[TOKEN1_IDX]; Where the amountsInU112 are retrieved from the balancer as a sorted array, index 0 == token0 and index 1 == token1, but on the Cron side, we must make sure that we retrieved the correct amount based on the tokens being sent as sorted or not when the pool was created.",

One of the subtractions, that for token1OutU112, is already \"correct-by- construction\", i.e. it can never underflow. The calculation of token0OutU112 can be reformulated to be explicitly safe as well; the following overall refactoring is suggested: uint256 ammEndToken0 = (token1ReserveU112 * sum0) / sum1; uint256 ammEndToken1 = (token0ReserveU112 * sum1) / sum0; token0ReserveU112 = ammEndToken0; token1ReserveU112 = ammEndToken1; token0OutU112 = sum0 - ammEndToken0; token1OutU112 = sum1 - ammEndToken1; Both output calculations are now of the form x (cid:0) (x (cid:3) y)=(y + z) for non-negative x, y , and z, allowing subtraction operations to be unchecked, which is both a gas optimization and gives confidence the calculation cannot freeze up unexpectedly due to an underflow. Replacement of divDown by / gives equivalent semantics with lower overhead. An additional advantage of this formulation is its manifest symmetry under 0 < (cid:0) > 1 interchange; this serves as a useful heuristic check on the computation, as it should possess the same symmetry as the invariant.",

        "body": "In the code snippet below, size can be made 0 by maliciously crafting the calldata. In this case, the free memory is not incremented. assembly { mPtrLength := mload(0x40) let size := and( add( and(calldataload(cdPtrLength), OffsetOrLengthMask), AlmostTwoWords ), OnlyFullWordMask ) calldatacopy(mPtrLength, cdPtrLength, size) mstore(0x40, add(mPtrLength, size)) } This has two different consequences: 1. If the memory offset mPtrLength is immediately used then junk values at that memory location can be interpreted as the decoded bytes type. In the case of Seaport 1.2, the likelihood of the current free memory pointing to junk value is low. So, this case has low severity. 17 2. The consequent memory allocation will also use the value mPtrLength to store data in memory. This can lead to corrupting the initial memory data. In the worst case, the next allocation can be tuned so that the first bytes data can be any arbitrary data. To make the size calculation return 0: 1. Find a function call which has bytes as a (nested) parameter. 2. Modify the calldata field where the length of the above byte is stored to the new length 0xffffe0. 3. The calculation will now return size = 0. Note: there is an additional requirement that this bytes type should be inside a dynamic struct. Otherwise, for example, in case of function foo(bytes calldata signature) , the compiler will insert a check that calldata- size is big enough to fit signature.length. Since the value 0xffffe0 is too big to be fit into calldata, such an attack is impractical. However, for bytes type inside a dynamic type, for example in function foo(bytes[] calldata signature), this check is skipped by solc (likely because it's expensive). For a practical exploit we need to look for such function. In case of Seaport 1.2 this could be the matchAdvancedOrders(AdvancedOrder[] calldata orders, ...) function. The struct AdvancedOrder has a nested parameter bytes signature as well as bytes extraData. In the above exploit one would be able to maliciously modify the calldata in such a way that Seaport would interpret the data in extraData as the signature. Here is a proof of concept for a simplified case that showcases injecting an arbitrary value into a decoded bytes. As for severity, even though interpreting calldata differently may not fundamentally break the protocol, an attacker with enough effort may be able to use this for subtle phishing attacks or as a precursor to other attacks.",

These new recipients are going to be used for this order from this point on. In _getGeneratedOrder, there is no comparison between old or new consideration recipients. The provided new recipients can create an issue when aggregating consideration items. Since the fulfillment data is provided beforehand by the caller of the Seaport endpoint, the caller might have provided fulfillment aggregation data that would have aggregated/combined one of the consideration items of this changed advance order with another consideration item. But the aggregation had taken into consideration the original recipient of the order in question. Multiple consideration items can only be aggregated if they share the same itemType, token, identi- fier, and recipient (ref). The new recipients provided by the contract offerer can break this invariant and in turn cause a revert.",

        "body": "In Seaport 1.1 and in Seaport 1.2 for non-contract orders, order hashes have a unique correspon- dence with the order, i.e., it can be used to identify the status of an order on-chain and track it. However, in case of contract orders, this is not the case. It is simply the current nonce of the offerer, combined with the address. This cannot be used to uniquely track an order on-chain. uint256 contractNonce; unchecked { contractNonce = _contractNonces[offerer]++; } assembly { orderHash := or(contractNonce, shl(0x60, offerer)) } Here are some example scenarios where this can be problematic: Scenario 1: A reverted contract order and the adjacent succeeding contract order will have the same order hash, regardless of whether they correspond to the same order. 1. Consider Alice calling fulfilledAdvancedOrder for a contract order with offerer = X, where X is a smart contract that offers contract orders on Seaport 1.2. Assume that this transaction failed because enough gas was not provided for the generateOrder call. This tx would revert with a custom error InvalidContrac- tOrder, generated from OrderValidator.sol#L391. 22 2. Consider Bob calling fulfilledAdvancedOrder for a different contract order with offerer = X, same smart contract offerer. OrderFulfiller.sol#L124 This order will succeed and emit the OrderFulfilled event the from In the above scenario, there are two different orders, one that reverted on-chain and the other that succeeded, both having the same orderHash despite the orders only sharing the same contract offerer--the other parameters can be completely arbitrary. Scenario 2: Contract order hashes computed off-chain can be misleading. 1. Consider Alice calling fulfilledAdvancedOrder for a contract order with offerer = X, where X is a smart contract that offers contract orders on Seaport 1.2. Alice computed the orderHash of their order off-chain by simulating the transaction, sends the transaction and polls the OrderFulfilled event with the same orderHash to know if the order has been fulfilled. 2. Consider Bob calling fulfilledAdvancedOrder for any contract order with offerer = X, the same smart contract offerer. 3. Bob's transaction gets included first. An OrderFulfilled event is emitted, with the orderHash to be the same hash that Alice computed off-chain! Alice may believe that their order succeeded. for non-contract Orders, the above approach would be valid, i.e., one may generate and sign an order, Note: compute the order hash of an order off-chain and poll for an OrderFulfilled with the order hash to know that it was fulfilled. Note: even though there is an easier way to track if the order succeeded in these cases, in the general case, Alice or Bob need not be the one executing the orders on-chain. And an off-chain agent may send misleading notifications to either parties that their order succeeded due to this quirk with contract order hashes.",

In particular, the startAmount a of these items is an important parameter to inspect: a ! a0 ! b ! a0 a : original startAmount parameter shared to Seaport by the caller encoded in the memory. a0 : the interpolated value and for orders of CONTRACT order type it is the value returned by the contract offerer (interpolation does not have an effect in this case since the startAmount and endAmount are enforced to be equal). b : must be 0 for used consideration items, otherwise the call would revert. For offer items, it can be in [0, 1) (See The spent offer item amounts shared with a zone for restricted (advanced) orders or with a contract offerer for orders of CONTRACT order type is not the actual spent amount in general). a0 : is the final amount shared by Seaport to either a zone for restricted orders and a contract offerer for CONTRACT order types.  Offer Items For offer items, perhaps the zone or the contract offerer would like to check that the offerer has spent a maxi- mum a0 of that specific offer item. For the case of restricted orders where the zone's validateOrder(...) will be called, the offerer might end up spending more than a0 amount of a specific token with the same identifier if the collection of orders includes:  A mix of open and restricted orders.  Multiple zones for the same offerer, offering the same token with the same identifier.  Multiple orders using the same zone. In this case, the zone might not have a sense of the orders of the transfers or which orders are included in the transaction in question (unless the contexts used by the zone enforces the exact ordering and number of items that can be matched/fulfilled in the same transaction). Note the order of transfers can be manipulated/engineered by constructing specific fulfillment data. Given a fulfillment data to combine/aggregate orders, there could be permutations of it that create different ordering of the executions.  An order with an actor (a consideration recipient, contract offerer, weird token, ...) that has approval to transfer this specific offer item for the offerer in question. And when Seaport calls into (NATIVE, ERC1155 token transfers, ...) this actor, the actor would transfer the token to a different address than the offerer. There also is a special case where an order with the same offer item token and identifier is signed on a different instance of Seaport (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, ..., or other non-official versions) which an actor (a consideration recipient, con- tract offerer, weird token, ...) can cross-call into (related Cross-Seaport re-entrancy with the stateful validateOrder call). The above issue can be avoided if the offerer makes sure to not sign different transactions across different or the same instances of Seaport which 1. Share the same offer type, offer token, and offer identifier, 2. but differ in a mix of zone, and order type 24 3. can be active at a shared timestamp And/or the offerer does not give untrusted parties their token approvals. A similar issue can arise for a contract offerer if they use a mix of signed orders of non-CONTRACT order type and CONTRACT order types.  Consideration Items For consideration items, perhaps the zone or the contract offerer would like to check that the recipient of each consideration item has received a minimum of a0 of that specific consideration item. This case also is similar to the offer items issues above when a mix of orders has been used.",

However, the free memory pointer is set to 256. The memory between [256, 269) can refer to both the string and another dynamic type that's allocated later on. Proof of concept for case 2: 5 function testToStringDirty() public { uint freememptr; // Make the next 4 bytes of the free memory dirty assembly { let dirty := not(0) freememptr := mload(0x40) mstore(freememptr, dirty) mstore(add(freememptr, 32), dirty) mstore(add(freememptr, 64), dirty) mstore(add(freememptr, 96), dirty) mstore(add(freememptr, 128), dirty) } string memory str = LibString.toString(1); uint len; bytes32 data; assembly { freememptr := str len := mload(str) data := mload(add(str, 32)) } emit log_named_uint(\"str: \", freememptr); emit log_named_uint(\"len: \", len); emit log_named_bytes32(\"data: \", data); assembly { freememptr := mload(0x40) } emit log_named_uint(\"memptr: \", freememptr); } Logs: str: 205 len: : 1 data: : 0x31ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff memptr: : 256 In both cases, high level solidity will not have issues decoding values as this region in memory is meant to be empty. However, certain ABI decoders, notably Etherscan, will have trouble decoding them. Note: It is likely that the use of toString() in ArtGobblers will not be impacted by the above issues.

Given these premises, it makes sense to implement a function that does not require users to make two distinct transactions to perform:  mint $GOO (via removeGoo).  burn $GOO + mint the Page/Gobbler (via mintFromGoo). 7 but rather use a single transaction that consumes the $GOO stacked on the Gobbler itself without ever minting and burning any $GOO from the Goo contract.

The project has estimated that minting and revealing all gobblers will take about 10 years. In the scenario simulated by the discussion \"Test to mint and reveal all the gobblers\" the number of requestRan- domSeed and fulfillRandomness made to reveal all the minted gobblers were more than 1500. Given the timespan of the project, the number of requests made to Chainlink to request a random number and the fundamental dependency that Chainlink VRF v1 has, we would like to highlight some concerns:  What would happen if Chainlink completely discontinues the Chainlink VRF v1? At the current moment, Chainlink has already released VRF v2 that replaces and enhances VRF v1.  What would happen in case of a Chainlink service outage and for some reason they decide not to pro- cess previous requests? Currently, the ArtGobbler contract does not allow to request a new \"request for randomness\". 13  What if the fulfillRandomness always gets delayed by a long number of days and users are not able to reveal their gobblers? This would not allow them to know the value of the gobbler (rarity and the visual representation) and start compounding $GOO given the fact that the gobbler does not have an emission multiple associated yet.  What if for error or on purpose (malicious behavior) a Chainlink operator calls fulfillRandomness multi- ple times changing the randomSeed during a reveal phase (the reveal of X gobbler can happen in multiple stages)?",

        "body": "The auction price model is made in a way that starts from a startPrice and decays over time. Each time a new action starts the price time will be equal to max(69, prevStartPrice * 2). Users in this case are incentivized to buy the legendary gobbler as soon as the auction starts because by doing so they are going to burn the maximum amount allowed of gobblers, allowing them to maximize the final emission multiple of the minted legendary gobbler. By doing this, you reach the end goal of maximizing the account's $GOO emissions. By waiting, the cost price of the legendary gobbler decays, and it also decays the emission multiple (because you can burn fewer gobblers). This means that if a user has enough gobblers to burn, he/she will burn them as soon as the auction starts. Another reason to mint a legendary gobbler as soon as the auction starts (and so burn as many gobblers as possible) is to make the next auction starting price as high as possible (always for the same reason, to be able to maximize the legendary gobbler emissions multiple). The next auction starting price is determined by legendaryGobblerAuctionData.startPrice = uint120(cost < 35 ? 69 : cost << 1); These mechanisms and behaviors can result in the following consequences:  Users that will have a huge number of gobblers will burn them as soon as possible, disallowing others that can't afford it to wait for the price to decay.  There will be less and less \"normal\" gobblers available to be used as part of the \"art\" aspect of the project. In the discussion \"Test to mint and reveal all the gobblers\" we have simulated a scenario in which a whale would be interested to collect all gobblers with the end goal of maximizing $GOO production. In that scenario, when the last Legendary Gobbler is minted we have estimated that 9644 gobbler have been burned to mint all the legendaries. 14",

This price, for a commit at update interval ID X, should not be influenced by any pending commits for IDs greater than X. However, in the current implementation price includes the current total supply but burn commits burn pool tokens immediately when commit() is called, not when upkeep() is executed. // pool token price computation at execution of updateIntervalId, example for long price priceHistory[updateIntervalId].longPrice = longBalance / (IERC20(tokens[LONG_INDEX]).totalSupply() + _totalCommit[updateIntervalId].longBurnAmount + _totalCommit[updateIntervalId].longBurnShortMintAmount) ,! The implementation tries to fix this by adding back all tokens burned at this updateIntervalId but it must also add back all tokens that were burned in future commits (i.e. when ID > updateIntervalID). This issue allows an attacker to get a better pool token price and steal pool token funds. Example: Given the preconditions:  long.totalSupply() = 2000  User owns 1000 long pool tokens  lastPriceTimestamp = 100  updateInterval = 10  frontRunningInterval = 5 At time 104: User commits to BurnLong 500 tokens in appropriateUpdateIntervalId = 5.

Then, as tokens are burned totalPoolCommitments[5].longBurnAmount = 500 and long.totalSupply -= 500. time 106: At 6 as they are now past totalPoolCommitments[6].longBurnAmount = 500, long.totalSupply -= 500 again as tokens are burned. User commits another 500 tokens to BurnLong at appropriateUpdateIntervalId = Now the frontRunningInterval and are scheduled for the next update. the 5th update interval Finally, (IERC20(tokens[LONG_INDEX]).totalSupply() + _totalCommit[5].longBurnAmount + _totalCom- mit[5].longBurnShortMintAmount = longBalance / (1000 + 500) which is a better price than what the user should have received. ID is executed by the pool keeper but at longPrice = longBalance / With a longBalance of 2000, the user receives 500 * (2000 / 1500) = 666.67 tokens executing the first burn commit and 500 * ((2000 - 666.67) / 1500) = 444.43 tokens executing the second one. 5 The total pool balance received by the user is 1111.1/2000 = 55.555% by burning only 1000 / 2000 = 50% of the pool token supply.",

The latter calls pause() in LeveragedPool and PoolCommitter: contract InvariantCheck is IInvariantCheck { function checkInvariants(address poolToCheck) external override { ... pause(IPausable(poolToCheck), IPausable(address(poolCommitter))); ... } function pause(IPausable pool, IPausable poolCommitter) internal { pool.pause(); poolCommitter.pause(); } } In LeveragedPool and PoolCommitter contracts, the checkInvariantsBeforeFunction() and checkIn- variantsAfterFunction() modifiers will make the transaction revert if checkInvariants() sets the paused state. contract LeveragedPool is ILeveragedPool, Initializable, IPausable { modifier checkInvariantsBeforeFunction() { invariantCheck.checkInvariants(address(this)); // can set paused to true require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); // will reset pause again _; } modifier checkInvariantsAfterFunction() { require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); _; invariantCheck.checkInvariants(address(this)); // can set paused to true require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); // will reset pause again } function pause() external override onlyInvariantCheckContract { // can only called from InvariantCheck paused = true; emit Paused(); } ,! } 9 contract PoolCommitter is IPoolCommitter, Initializable { modifier checkInvariantsBeforeFunction() { invariantCheck.checkInvariants(leveragedPool); // can set paused to true require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); // will reset pause again _; } modifier checkInvariantsAfterFunction() { require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); _; invariantCheck.checkInvariants(leveragedPool); // can set paused to true require(!paused, \"Pool is paused\"); // will reset pause again } function pause() external onlyInvariantCheckContract { // can only called from InvariantCheck paused = true; emit Paused(); }",

        "body": "The issue was spotted while analysing additional impact and fix for 67 Proof of concept checked with the original audit commit: 28062f477f571b38fe4f8455170bd11094a71862 and the newest available commit from dev branch: 2ed4370b5de9cec5c455f5485358db194f093b01 Due to the architecture decision which implements orders queue as a cyclic buffer the OrderBook after reaching MAX_ORDERS (~32k) for a given price point, starts to overwrite stale orders. If an order was never claimed or it is broken, so it cannot be claimed, it is not possible to place a new order in a queue. This emerges due to a fact that it is not possible to finalize the stale order and deliver the underlying assets, what is done while placing a new and replacing a stale order. Effectively this issue can be used to block the main functionality of the OrderBook, so placing new orders for a given price point. Only a single broken order per price-point is enough to lead to this condition. The issue will not be immediately visible as it requires the cyclic buffer to make a circle and encounter the broken order. The proof of concept in SecurityAuditTests.sol attachment implements a simple scenario where a USDC-like mock token is used: 1. Mallory creates one ASK order at some price point (to sell X base tokens for Y quoteTokens). 2. Mallory transfers ownership of the OrderNFT token to an address which is blacklisted by quoteToken (e.g. USDC) 3. Orders queue implemented as a circular buffer over time overflows and starts replacing old orders. 4. When it is the time to replace the order the quoteToken is about to be transferred, but due to the blacklist the assets cannot be delivered. 5. At this point it is impossible to place new orders at this price index, unless the owner of the OrderNFT transfers it to somebody who can receive quoteToken.
