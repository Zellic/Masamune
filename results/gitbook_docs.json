[{"title": "Introduction", "html_url": "https://www.mev.wiki/", "body": "Introduction Welcome to the MEV Wiki. This is a public resource for learning about  MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). We cover a range of topics including the key concepts, research on this the topic, different approaches to tackling this issue by various projects out there.  Find any errors or wants to share your opinions? See how you can contribute  here . Maximal (formerly \"miner\" in the context of Proof of Work) extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by censoring and/or changing the order of transactions in a block. When someone sends a transaction in the blockchain, there is a delay between the time when the transaction is broadcasted to the network and when it is actually mined into a block. During this period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool called the mempool where contents are visible to everyone. Arbitrageurs and miners can monitor the mempool and find opportunities to maximize their own profits e.g. by frontrunning transactions. If a front-runner is a miner, they can also reorder or even censor transactions. MEV income can also be shared with non miners & traders who participate in some profit sharing schemes within the category of  FaaS/MEVA . MEV can harm users MEV is an invisible tax that miners can collect from users. MEV can destabilize Ethereum If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus by reordering or censoring transactions. You can use the  Flashbots Dashboard  to track Extracted MEV to better assess this worsening trend realtime. It is estimated that more than $727M of MEV has been extracted since 1st January 2020. The majority of extracted MEV tend to be from  Arbitrage  opportunities on various  AMMs , with a large percentage of income going to searchers, bots & participants in profit sharing MEV infrastructures (eg.  Flashbot's  MEV-GETH) Another useful tracker for gas consumption of back-running bots:   Dune Analytics  provides very detailed statistics on this worsening MEV situation.

Front-running is the process by which an adversary observes transactions on the network layer and then acts upon this information by, for instance, issuing a competing transaction, with the hope that this transaction is mined before a victim transaction e.g. Transaction A is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction B so that A gets mined before B.

Back-running occurs when a transaction sender wishes to have their transaction ordered immediately after some unconfirmed \"target transaction\". Example: A back-running bot that back-runs new token listings. Bot monitors the Ethereum mempool for new pairs being created on Uniswap. If it finds a new pair the bot places a buy transaction immediately behind the initial liquidity. The bot swoops in and buys as many tokens as possible (but not all of them as there needs to be an opportunity for others to buy tokens as well).The bot then waits for the price to go up as other traders buy the token from Uniswap and proceeds to sell back the tokens at a higher price. The key in this strategy is to be the first to buy tokens, but only after the token has been launched  . In order to maximise their chances of being mined immediately after their target, a typical backrunner will send many identical transactions, with gas price identical to that of the target transaction, sometimes from different accounts. https://amanusk.medium.com/the-fastest-draw-on-the-blockchain-bzrx-example-6bd19fabdbe1 Previous Sandwich attack Next Liquidations Last updated  2 years ago", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Liquidations", "html_url": "https://www.mev.wiki/attack-examples/liquidations", "body": "Liquidations How are liquidations exploited? Back-running strategies also apply to liquidations whereby a transaction sender wishes to be the first to liquidate a loan right after a price oracle update (which will allow liquidation to be triggered). Fixed spread liquidation used by Compound, Aave, and dYdX allows a liquidator to purchase collateral at a fixed discount when repaying debt. Strategy 1 Strategy 2 A detects a liquidation opportunity at block B (i.e., after the execution of B). A then issues a liquidation transaction T, which is expected to be mined in the next block B +1. A attempts to destructively front-run other competing liquidators by setting high transaction fees for his liquidation transaction T. A observes a transaction T, which will create a liquidation opportunity (e.g., an oracle price update transaction which will render a collateralized debt liquidatable). A then back-runs T with a liquidation transaction TA to avoid the transaction fee bidding competition. The auction liquidation allows a liquidator to start an auction that lasts for a pre-configured period (e.g., 6 hours). Competing liquidators can engage and bid on the collateral price.

Time-bandit attacks are attacks where miners rewrite blockchain history to steal funds allocated by smart contracts in the past. If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus. Imagine there are two miners, Sam and Dan, who are paid a $100 reward for each block they find. Sam has found 3 blocks, the first of which contained a $10,000 arbitrage opportunity. Now Dan has a choice: he can either mine on top of Sams 3 blocks, or he can attempt to re-mine the first block in order to take the Uniswap arbitrage for himself. The $10,000 is much more lucrative than the $100 block reward, and Dan is more rational than honest, so he decides to re-mine the first block. While Dans at it, since the current longest chain is height 3, he also re-mines the second and third blocks (and captures any MEV that was in those, too). After the re-organization, Dan owns the longest chain and he and Sam can progress from the third block.

Bundles are groups of transactions Flashbots users submit. Those transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. A bundle should never be split up. Robert Miller found that for a specific bundle, only the \"Buy\" part of a sandwich bundle submitted had landed on-chain, and right after that Buy someone else had inserted a 7 gas transaction that arbitraged it. How? In Ethereum occasionally two blocks are mined at roughly the same time, and only one block can be added to the chain. The other gets \"uncled\" or orphaned. Anyone can access transactions in an uncled block and some of the transactions may not have ended up in the non-uncled block. In a way some transactions end up in a sort of mempool like state: they are now public as a part of the uncled block and perhaps still valid too. A Sandwicher's bundle was included in an uncled block. An attacker saw this, grabbed only the Buy part of the Sandwich, threw away the rest, and added an arbitrage after. The attacker then submitted that as a bundle, which was then mined. Instead of seeing something late in time and rewinding it (time-bandit attack), the uncle bandit attack is when an attacker sees something in an uncle and brings it forward. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well. https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339?s=20 Previous Time bandit attack Next Attempts to trick the bots Last updated  2 years ago", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Attempts to trick the bots", "html_url": "https://www.mev.wiki/attempts-to-trick-the-bots", "body": "Attempts to trick the bots What are the ways some have come up with to trick bots?

Miners receive bundles of transaction from users and include the bundle that pays them the most. Users love this because they only pay for transactions that are included and they can determine the fee that they are going to pay. Sandwich bots watch the mempool for users buying on DEXes and sandwich them: running the price up before the victim buys and dumping after for a profit. Those 3 txs (buy, victim transaction, sell) make up a bundle. Note the Sandwich sell transaction contains the smart contract payment to the miner. It's important that payment goes to the miner on the sell transaction! That should only happen after the bot has secured profit from selling the tokens bought in their front-run. If that sell fails then there is no payment to the miner, and thus their bundle shouldn't be included To be even more secure, bots will simulate their transactions on local infrastructure. Bots won't send transactions unless the simulation goes well. Paying transaction fees only on the sell transaction of a sandwich should defend against this. No profit, no payment. Simulation vs Reality Some really smart people found weaknesses among all of these defenses. The first defense was that simulation was done with an ERC20 transfer function that checked to see if the block was a mined by Flashbots' miners, and if so it transfers way less out. Local simulations look fine but do not work in production. The second defense - Payment only on a sell transaction Again: Sandwich bots make miner payment conditional on profit. That was broken by making the ERC20 token pay the miner. Thus even with the Sandwich bot sell failing, the miner would still get paid! Here's what actually happened: Sandwich bot gets baited and buys 100 ETH of the poisonous token. Poisonous token owner's bait triggers custom transfer function, which pays 0.1 ETH to the miner Sandwich bot's sell doesn't work because of the poisonous token. As the sandwich bot submitted these three transactions in a bundle all three were included: the successful buy, the bait, and the failed sell. The poisonous ERC20's payment via the custom transfer was what incentivized a miner to include it! It is estimated that the first person to do this made about 100 ETH. You can see the poisoned ERC20 Uniswap transactions  here  . From Victim to Predator One of their victims was one the most successful Flashbots bot operators, and they immediately sprung into action. In a short period of time the victim turned into an apex predator. They launched a similar but slightly different ERC20 (YOLOchain), and ended up successfully baiting many more sandwichers. They made 300 ETH doing so!

MEV Auction (MEVA) is created in which the winner of the auction has the right to reorder submitted transactions and insert their own, as long as they do not delay any specific transaction by more than N blocks. Implementing the Auction The auction is able to extract MEV from miners by separating two functions 1) Transaction inclusion; and 2) transaction ordering. In order to implement MEVA roles are defined.  Block producers  determine transaction inclusion, and  Sequencers  determine transaction ordering. Block producers - Transaction Inclusion Block proposers are most analogous to traditional blockchain miners. Instead of proposing blocks with an ordering, they simply propose a set of transactions to eventually be included before N blocks. Sequencers - Transaction Ordering Sequencers are elected by a smart contract managed auction run by the block producers called the MEVA contract. This auction assigns the right to sequence the last N transactions. If, within a timeout the sequencer has not submitted an ordering which is included by block proposers, a new sequencer is elected. Implementation on Layer 2 It is possible to enshrine this MEVA contract directly on layer 1 (L1) blockchain consensus protocols. However, it is also possible to non-invasively add this mechanism in layer 2 (L2) and use it to manage Optimistic Rollup transactio ordering. In L2, L1 miners are repurposed and utilized as block proposers. MEVA contract is implemented and designated a single sequencer at a time.

This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering. When transactions are fed into Conveyor, it determines the order of the incoming transactions and makes it impossible for block producers to perform the following: Inject new transactions into the Conveyor output: The inserted transactions bypassing Conveyor is detectable by anyone because of signature mismatch. Delete ordered transactions: Transactions accepted by Conveyor are broadcasted everywhere so transactions cannot be deleted unless ALL block producers are colluding and censoring the transactions at the same time. From the DEXs perspective, they can choose to accept either Ordered transactions from Automatas Conveyor which is free from transaction reordering and other front-running transactions Other unordered transactions (which include front-running etc) that may negatively impact their users Why should users trust Conveyor? Automatas Conveyor runs on a decentralized compute plane backed by many Geode instances. Each Geode instance can be attested so anyone can publicly verify that the Geode is running on a system with genuine hardware (i.e., CPU) and that the Geode application code matches the version that is open-sourced and audited. This provides a strong guarantee that: The Geode code is untampered with The Geode data is inaccessible to even Geode providers (In which case they cannot act on said data to front-run transactions) Importantly, Automatas Conveyor is a chain-agnostic solution to the MEV issue, and works seamlessly on various platforms  zero modifications needed. An industry-first: Oblivious RAM In fully public computation, access pattern leakage is not negligible as everything is exposed. But in privacy-preserving computation, any tiny bit of information leakage becomes a significant issue. Studies have shown that access pattern leakage leads to exposure of sensitive information such as private keys from searchable encryption and trusted computing. This is where the Oblivious RAM algorithm comes into play. Automatas implementation is the first-of-its-kind in the blockchain industry, providing an exceedingly high degree of privacy in dApps. This greatly reduces the probability of user privacy being leaked even as access patterns are being monitored and analyzed by malicious actors. The Automata team has authored multiple research papers on state-of-the-art ORAM and hardware technologies to enhance the privacy and performance of existing networks.

Vega's proposal is to add a module to blockchains that supports the concept of relative fairness so that competing transactions may be sequenced under a known and understood protocol, and not subject to a validators discretion. \" If there is a time t such that all honest validators saw a before t and b after t, then a must be scheduled before b.  This is a property that can be assured of at any time with a minimal impact on performance. To get the best combination, their current approach is a hybrid of the two. In normal operation, the protocol will assure block fairness. If the network detects that this causes a bottleneck, it temporarily switches to the timed approach (thus sacrificing a little fairness for performance), before switching back once the bottleneck is resolved. However, Vega will ultimately make the level of fairness customisable by market.

Institutional staking pools (e.g. exchanges) may have social and reputational constraints that prevent them from extracting certain forms of MEV. This allows smaller staking firms and decentralized pools without these constraints to provide higher returns for their stakers.

Some examples are available  here . Components of Efficiency  Note that the duty weighting is based on the consensus layer specification.  Huge thanks to  Ben Edington  for providing  https://eth2book.info/capella/ Attester Efficiency   84.4% (= 54/64)  of validators' rewards come from attestations. Every epoch (~6.4 minutes), a validator proposes an attestation (vote) to the network.  These attestations contain valuable information about the consensus layer and are rewarded based on their correctness and inclusion delay. An attestation consists of three votes: - Head vote - Source vote - Target vote If a validator votes correctly on all three and is included in the block with the best inclusion delay (1), the reward will be 100%, as good as it can be. Conveniently, the  beacon node API  returns the idealReward for a given epoch. The idealReward represents the maximum potential rewards based on optimal performance, which allows us to calculate attester efficiency. Copy attester_efficiency = actualReward / idealReward Proposer Efficiency Block proposals are purely luck-based, but over the long run, 12.5% (8/64) of validators' rewards come from block proposals. Blocks include execution rewards (transaction rewards + MEV rewards) and scale with the number of attestations and sync committee outputs included in a block. Comparing validator performance based on the luck of inclusion of attestations and MEV rewards (which highly depend on market volatility) would not provide meaningful context. Thus, proposer efficiency solely depends on the number of successfully proposed blocks divided by the total number of blocks that a validator could have proposed.  This leads to the following formula: Copy proposer_efficiency = proposedBlocks / totalBlocks Some validators may not be lucky enough to propose a block, but their efficiency needs to be comparable with other validators who did propose a block. For this reason, the proposer efficiency will be  1  for validators who did not propose a block. Our v2 dashboard and API will provide both proposal efficiency and efficiency to provide more context. Sync Efficiency Every 256 epochs, 512 validators are elected to be part of the sync committee. Like block proposals, being part of a sync committee is purely luck-based. However, over the long run, 3.1% (2/64) of validators' rewards come from sync committee duties. With 500,000 validators, the expected time between being selected for sync committee duty is approximately 37 months. During this period, the rewards for sync committee members are significantly higher. Compared to attestations, which occur once per epoch, sync duties occur in every slot for 256 epochs, totaling 8192 duties per sync committee member. To reflect actual performance, sync efficiency doesnt rely on rewards but on the number of correctly executed sync duties. To avoid skewing the sync efficiency by the scheduled duties, we divide it. Since sync duties need to be included in a block by the block proposer, we subtract missed blocks that occurred during this period to avoid penalizing the sync committee member. This leads to the following formula Copy sync_efficiency = executed_Sync / (scheduled_Sync - missed_Blocks) Validators may not be lucky enough to be elected in a sync committee, but their efficiency needs to be comparable with other validators who did participate. For this reason, the sync efficiency will be  1  for validators who were not elected. Our v2 dashboard and API will provide both proposal efficiency and efficiency to provide more context. Examples: Efficiency calculation Example 1 When a validator has  attestations, block proposals, and sync committees , the efficiency is calculated as: Copy efficiency = ((54/64 * attester_efficiency) + (8/64 * proposer_efficiency) + (2/64 * sync_efficiency)) Example 2  For validators who have participated in attestations and block proposals  but not in sync committees , the efficiency is computed as: Copy efficiency = ((56/64 * attester_efficiency) + (8/64 * proposer_efficiency)) Example 3  When a validator has participated in attestations and sync committees  but not in block proposals , the efficiency formula is: Copy efficiency = ((62/64 * attester_efficiency) + (2/64 * sync_efficiency)) Example 4 If a validator has participated only in attestations, the efficiency is simply: Copy efficiency = 1 * attester_efficiency Last updated  3 months ago", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Notifications", "html_url": "https://kb.beaconcha.in/v1-beaconcha.in-explorer/notifications", "body": "Notifications Understanding notifications How to configure beaconcha.in notifications Last updated  3 months ago", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Understanding notifications", "html_url": "https://kb.beaconcha.in/v1-beaconcha.in-explorer/notifications/understanding-notifications", "body": "Understanding notifications", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Notification configuration", "html_url": "https://kb.beaconcha.in/v1-beaconcha.in-explorer/notifications/beaconcha.in-notifications", "body": "Notification configuration How to configure beaconcha.in notifications Configuration This article provides a tutorial on setting up and debugging notifications using beaconcha.in's web and mobile platforms.

Roles : Assign validators their duties Finalize checkpoints Perform a protocol-level random number generation (RNG) Progress the beacon chain Vote on the head of the chain for the fork choice. source Slots 32 Slots = 1 Epoch  A time period of  12 seconds  in which a randomly chosen validator has time to propose a block. Each slot may or may not have a block in it. The total number of validators is split up in committees and one or more individual committees are responsible to attest to each slot. One validator from the committee will be chosen to be the aggregator, while the other 127 validators are attesting. After each Epoch, the validators are mixed and merged to new committees. There is a minimum of 128 validators per committee. image source Epoch 1 Epoch = 32 Slots  Represents the number of 32 slots and takes approximately  6.4 minutes.  Epochs play an important role when it comes to the  validator queue  and  finality . Deposit contract The Deposit contract is the  gateway  to Ethereum 2.0  through a smart contract  on Ethereum 1.0. The smart contract accepts any transaction with a minimum amount of 1 ETH and a valid input data. Ethereum 2.0 beacon-nodes listen to the deposit contract and use the input data to credit each validator. More infos the Deposit Contract Input Data The Input data, also called the  deposit data , is a user generated, 842 long sequence of characters. It represents the  validator public key and the withdrawal public key , which were signed with by the validator private key. The input data needs to be added to the transaction to the  deposit contract  in order to get identified by the  beacon-chain . More infos about the Deposit process. Validator Validators need to deposit 32 ETH into the validator deposit contract on the Ethereum 1.0 chain. Validator operators have to run a validator node. Its job is to propose blocks and sign attestations. A validator has to be online for at least 50% of the time in order to have positive returns. Eligible for activation & Estimated activation Refers to pending validators. The deposit has been recognized by the ETH2 chain at the timestamp of Eligible for activation. If there is a queue of  pending validators , an estimated timestamp for activation is calculated. Unique Index Every validator receives its unique index.  beaconcha.in . Current Balance & Effective Balance The current balance is the amount of ETH held by the validator as of now. The  effective Balance  represents a value calculated by the current balance. It is used to determine the size of a reward or penalty a validator receives. The effective balance can **never be higher than 32 ETH. In order to increase the effective balance, the validator requires effective balance + 1.25 ETH.** In other words, if the effective balance is 20 ETH, a current balance of 21.25 ETH is required in order to have an effective balance of 21 ETH. The effective balance  will adjust once it drops by 0.25  below the threshold as seen in the examples above. Here are examples on how the effective balance changes If the Current balance is 32.00 ETH  the Effective balance is 32.00 ETH If the Current balance dropped from 22 ETH to 21.76 ETH  Effective balance will be  22.00 ETH If the Current balance increases to 22.25  and  the effective balance is 21 ETH, the effective balance will increase to 22 ETH Slasher The  slasher   is its own entity  but requires a beacon-node to receive  attestations . To find malicious activity by validators, the slashers iterates through all received attestations until a  slashable offense  has been found. Found slashings are broadcasted to the network and the next  block proposer  adds the proof to the block. The block proposer receives a reward for slashing the malicious validator. However, the whistleblower (=Slasher) does not receive a reward. Slashable offenses Attestation violation Double voting  An  attester  signs two different attestations  in one epoch. Surround votes  An  attester  and sign an attestation that surrounds another one. Proposer violation Double block proposal  A  block   proposer  signs two different blocks for the same slot. Attestation Votes by validators which confirm the validity of a block. (=Attester) Block proposer A chosen validator by the beacon chain to propose the next block. There can only be one valid block per  slot . Block status Proposed  The block passed and was proposed by a validator. Scheduled  Validators are currently submitting data. Missed/Skipped  The proposer didnt propose the block within the given time frame, so the block was missed/skipped. Orphaned  In order to understand this, let us look at the diagram below \"1, 2, 3, ... ,9\" represent the slots. Validator at slot 1 proposes the block a. Validator at slot 2 proposes b. Slot 4 is being skipped because the validator didnt propose a block (e.g.: offline). At slot 5/6 a fork occurs: Validator(5) proposes a block, but validator(6) doesnt receive this data (e.g.: the block didnt reach them fast enough). Therefore Validator(6) proposes its block with the most recent information it sees from validator(3). The  fork choice rule  is the key here - It decides which of the available chains is the canonical one. Validator Lifecycle 1. Deposited 32 ETH has been deposited to the ETH1 deposit-contract and this state will be kept for around 7 hours. This offers security in case the ETH1 chain gets attacked. 2. Pending Waiting for activation on ETH2 Before validators enter the validator queue, they need to be voted in by other active validators. This occurs every 4 hours. Until 327680 active validators in the network, 4 validators can be activated per epoch. For every  65536  (=4 * 16384) active validator, the validator  activation rate  goes up by one. 5 validators per epoch requires 327680 active validators which translates to 1125 validators per day. 6 validators per epoch requires 393216 active validators which translates to 1350 validators per day. 7 validators per epoch requires 458752 active validators which translates to 1575 validators per day. 8 validators per epoch requires 524288 active validators which translates to 1800 validators per day. 9 validators per epoch requires 589824 active validators which translates to 2025 validators per day. 10 validators per epoch requires 655360 active validators which translates to 2200 validators per day. Amount of activations scales with the amount of active validators and the limit is the active validator set divided by 64.000 3. Active Validator Currently attesting and proposing blocks  (=block proposer) . The validator will stay active until: its balance drops below 16 ETH (ejected). voluntary exit it gets slashed 4.

A  Slashing  is a large penalty ( 1/32 of balance at stake**)** and a forceful exit ...  . - Justin Drake 5. Exiting Validator Ejected  The validator balance fell below a threshold and was kicked out by the network Exited  Voluntary exit, the withdrawal key holder has the ability to  withdraw  the current balance of the corresponding validator balance. Finalization In Ethereum 2.0  at least two third of the validators have to be honest , therefore if there are two competing Epochs and one third of the validators decide to be malicious, they will receive a penalty. Honest ones will be rewarded. In order to determine if an Epoch has been finalized, validators have to agree on the latest two epochs in a row (= justified) then all previous Epochs can be considered as finalized. Finality issues If there are less than 66.6% votes (=participation rate) in a specific epoch, the epoch cannot be justified. As mentioned in \" Finalization \", three justified epochs in a row are required to reach finality. As long as the chain cannot reach this state it has finality issues. During finality issues the validator (entry) queue will be halted and new validators will not be able to join the network, however, inactive validators with less than <16ETH balance will be kicked out of the network. This leads to more stability in the network and higher participation rate.

Once the threshold of  16,384 deposits  is met, the network will try to accomplish the second condition by trying to find the  trigger block  by calculating  min_genesis_time - genesis_delay. The goal of the trigger block  (min_genesis_time - genesis_delay)  is that the chain can never start earlier than  min_genesis_time . The second scenario will make this clearer.

In this case, the second condition is met first and the trigger block becomes whatever  min_genesis_time  was set.

However, validator keys have additional functionality, and its keys require different parameters when creating them, and use the  B oneh- L ynn- S hacham  (= BLS ) signature scheme. Ethereum validator keys Compared to EOA-keys, where users only have a  single private  key to access their funds, validator-keys offers two different keys. The  validator   private  key and the  withdrawal   private  key. The validator key As seen in the cutout below the validator signing key consists of two elements: Validator  private  key Validator  public  key The purpose of the  validator private key  is to  actively  sign on-chain operations such as block proposals and attestations. Therefore these keys have to be held in a hot wallet. This flexibility has the advantage to move validator signing keys very quickly from one device to another, however, if they have gotten lost or stolen, the thief has the ability to  act maliciously  in two ways: Get the validator  slashed  by: Being a  proposer  and sign two different beacon blocks for the same slot Being an  attester  and sign an attestation that \"surrounds\" another one. Being an  attester  and sign two different attestations having the same target.  Force a  voluntary exit , which stops the validator from \"staking\", and grants access to its ETH balance to the withdrawal key owner. The  validator public key  is included in the  deposit data  which allows the consensus layer to identify the validator. The withdrawal key Just like the validator keys, the withdrawal keys also consist of two components: Withdrawal  private  key Withdrawal  public  key Losing this key means losing access to the validator balance. However, the validator can still sign attestations and blocks since these actions require the validator private key, but there is little to no incentive to do so if the keys are lost. To withdraw, the validator status needs to be \" exited \". Multiple validators from a single wallet Each validator has their own  unique deposit data  by which they are identified by the  beaconchain .  Four keys  for  one validator . Q:  How can I re-deposit to my validator balance? (e.g.  Effective balance  has dropped) A:  Send another transaction (>=1ETH) to the  deposit contract  with the  validator specific  deposit data   as the transaction input. After the first deposit-transaction, the  unique deposit data  is stored on the blockchain and can be found on various explorers. Note:  The deposit contract requires about  150,000 gas   limit. Mnemonics for  validator keys Over the last few years, we have become so accustomed to the  12 or 24 word-system . Why do we take steps back again and make our lives more complicated and more insecure with locally stored keys? Known hardware wallets will not be able to support validator key generation until the BLS library gets audited.  EIP-2333  and  EIP-2334  offer a solution but yet need to be implemented. How does it work? Mnemonics  and paths are a known feature and usually found when  users try to access  their hardware wallets. \"Old ETH 1.0\" path structure and example: m/44'/60'/0'/0 m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index The same logic applies to validator Keys, just with  different  parameters.  There is a single \"master key\"  (=Mnemonic phrase) which allows the user to attach as many validators to a single  withdrawal key  as they want. This way the user can  derive all keys  from the Mnemonic phrase. A simplified overview would look like the following: Source: Carl Beekhuizen Credits:  Nishant Das  for fact-checking Last updated  3 months ago", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Deposit Process", "html_url": "https://kb.beaconcha.in/ethereum-staking/deposit-process", "body": "Deposit Process Ethereum staking deposit process This post will explain the depositing process and each of the phases. Before we start, to understand the basic idea of how Ethereum 2.0 keys work, the  Ethereum 2.0 Keys  blog is highly recommended The deposit contract Let's go through each of the  states  above and explain how their  durations  are approximately determined. 1. Mempool - Status: Unknown Every signed transaction visits the  Mempool  first, which can be referred to as the waiting room for transactions. During this period, the  transaction status  is  pending . Depending on the chosen  gas fee  for the transaction, miners pick the ones that return them the most value first. If the network is highly congested (=many pending transactions), there's a high chance that new transactions will outbid(gas fees) older transactions, leading to  unknown  waiting times. 2. Deposit contract - Status: Deposited Once the transaction reaches the  deposit contract,  the deposit contract checks the transaction for its  Input data  and  value.  If the  threshold  of 1 ETH is not met or the transaction has  no/invalid  input data, the transaction will get  rejected  and returned to the sender. The user-created  input data  is a reflection of the upcoming  validator and withdrawal keys  on the Ethereum 2.0 network as seen in the picture below. The full Ethereum 2.0 keys blog is  here . Why exactly does this take at least 13.6 hours? The Ethereum 2.0 chain only considers transactions which have been in the deposit contract for at least 2048 Ethereum 1.0 blocks to ensure they never end up in a  reorged  block.  (= ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE ) In addition to the 2048 Ethereum 1.0 blocks, 64  Ethereum 2.0   Epochs  ****must be**** awaited before the beacon-chain recognises the deposit. During these 64 Epochs, validators vote on newly received deposits. However,  missed block  proposals or bad Ethereum 1.0 nodes, which provide the deposit logs to the Ethereum 2.0 network can cause longer waiting times. Therefore, run your  own node ! 2048 blocks  = 2048 x 12 seconds = 24,576 seconds = 409.6 minutes =  ~6.82 hours   64 Epochs  = 64 x 6.4 minutes = 409.6 minutes =  ~6.82 hours Once the deposit is in the deposit contract, the state of the validator will switch to  Deposited  on the  beaconcha.in  explorer Rejected Deposit 3. Validator Queue - Status: Pending The deposit is accessible now for the beacon-chain. Depending on the amount of total deposits, the validators have to wait in a queue. Eight validators per  Epoch  ( 1800 validators per day)  can get activated. 4. Staking - Status: Active The validator is now actively staking. It is proposing blocks and signing attestations - ready to earn ETH! Other validator status Deposit Invalid The transaction had an invalid  BLS  signature. Active Offline An active validator has not been attesting for at least two epochs. Exiting Online The validator  is online  and currently exiting the network because either its  balance dropped below 16ETH (forced exit)  or the  exit was requested   (voluntary exit)  by the validator. Exiting Offline The validator  is offline  and currently exiting the network because either its  balance dropped below 16ETH  or the  exit was requested  by the validator. Slashing Online The validator  is online  but was malicious and therefore forced to  exit  the network. Slashing Offline The validator  is offline  and was malicious and which lead to a forced to exit out of the network. The validator is currently in the exiting queue with a minimum of 25 minutes. Slashed The validator has been kicked out of the network. The funds will be withdrawable after 36 days. Exited The validator has exited the network. The funds will be withdrawable after 1 day.

This vote consists of the following segments: Committee Validator Index Finality vote Signature Chain head vote (vote on what the validator believes is the head of the chain)   If we multiply that with the information included in each Attestation per Epoch, it adds up quickly. Therefore, the consensus layer  aggregates  all of that information and minimises the data growth.  Aggregated Attestation  Each block one or more committees are chosen to attest. A committee has a minimum of 128 validators, of which 16 are randomly selected to become an aggregator. As shown below, the validators broadcast their unaggregated attestation to the aggregators (red arrow). The aggregators then merge the attestations and forward a single aggregated attestation to the  block proposer .  Attestation Inclusion Lifecycle   Generation Propagation Aggregation Propagation Inclusion   Rewards The attestation reward is dependent on two variables, the  base reward  and the  inclusion delay. The best case for the inclusion delay is to be 1. Base reward ( Validator effective balance * 2**6 )   / SQRT( Effective balance of  all  active validators )   Inclusion delay At the time when the validators voted on the head of the chain (Block 0),  Block 1  was not proposed yet. Therefore attestations naturally get included  one block  later; so all attestations who voted on  Block 0  being the chain head got included in  Block 1  and, the  inclusion delay  is 1. The effects of the inclusion delay on the attestation reward  As shown below, an Inclusion delay of 2 causes the the reward to drop by 50%.   A ttestation scenarios  Missing Voting Validator These validators have a maximum of 1 epoch to submit their attestation. If the attestation was missed in epoch 0, they can submit it with an inclusion delay in epoch 1.  Missing Aggregator There are 16 Aggregators per epoch in total, additionally, random validators from the beacon-chain subscribe to  two subnets for 256 Epochs  and serve as a backup in case aggregators are missing. Missing block proposer Note that in some cases a lucky aggregator may also become the block proposer. If the attestation was not included because the block proposer has gone missing, the next block proposer would pick the aggregated attestation up and include it into the next block. However, the  inclusion delay  will increase by one.

Curve core originally was pegged assets but a new type of AMM allows for extremely efficient trading and low risks of non-pegged assets.   Crypto pools use liquidity more effectively by concentrating it at current prices. As trades happen, the pool readjusts its internal price to the highest liquidity region without creating losses for the pool. Crypto pools also have variable fees which can range between 0.04% and 0.40%.   Tricrypto , the first and main base pool has the following coins: USDT/WBTC/WETH for Ethereum. On Polygon, the first pool has AAVE tokens and can handle swaps with the following tokens: DAI/USDC/USDT/ETH/WBTC.   Liquidity Providers    Becoming a liquidity provider in a Curve Crypto pool is in all ways similar to stable pools. You will gain exposure and risks to all assets in the pools. You can deposit one or all the coins in the pool. Always be sure to check the bonus/slippage warning box.   Fees    Fees on those pool range from 0.04% to 0.4%. The current fee varies based on how close the price is from the internal oracle. You can check a pool's current fee which changes every trade on the bottom of a pool page.   Risks    As with any liquidity providing in blockchain, there are some smart contract risks involved. Curve crypto pools have been audited by MixBytes and ChainSecurity but audits never eliminate risks completely.

Whitepaper                                Home             Getting Started              Understanding Curve (v1)   Getting started with Curve isnt easy, there is a lot to grasp and the unique UI can be a lot to take in. This small guide is intended for Curve beginners with an understanding of DeFi and Crypto. It tries to answer recurring questions about how to get started with Curve and how it works or makes money for liquidity providers.   What is Curve.fi?    The easiest way to understand Curve is to see it as an exchange. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralised protocols  exchange ERC-20 tokens (DAI to USDC for example) through it with low fees and low slippage . Unlike exchanges that match a buyer and a seller, Curve uses liquidity pools. To achieve successful exchange volume, Curve needs a high volume of liquidity (tokens) and therefore offers rewards to  liquidity providers .   Curve is  non-custodial , meaning the Curve developers do not have access to your tokens. Curve pools are also non-upgradable, so you can have confidence that the logic protecting your funds can never change.   What are liquidity pools?    Liquidity pools are pools of tokens that sit in smart contracts and can be exchanged or withdrawn at rates set by the parameters of the smart contract. Adding liquidity to a liquidity pool gives you the opportunity to earn trading fees and possibly rewards. For more information, visit the following section:   Understanding Curve Pools   What are those percentages next to each pool?    Curve pools may have several different percentages shown next to them in the UI.     The first column, vAPY, refers to the annualized rate of trading fees earned by liquidity providers in the pool. Any activity on every Curve pool generates fees, a portion of which accrue to everybody who has a stake in the pool. Further information is in the  Liquidity Provider section .   The second column refers to the reward gauges. This entitles liquidity providers to earn bonus CRV emissions. More detail on these bonuses are in the  Reward Gauges section .   What is the CRV token?    CRV token is a governance and utility token for Curve.   Understanding CRV   Understanding Governance   Can I use Curve on sidechains?    Yes. Curve has launched on several sidechains and will continue to do so. Visit our section on Multichain for more information.   How Can I Launch a Pool    All new Curve pools are deployed permissionlessly through the Curve Factory. This means anybody can deploy a pool anytime, anywhere. For a full guide, check our Factory Pools section.    Why has Curve grown so quickly?    When Curve launched it grew quickly by securing the underdeveloped stablecoin market. Stablecoins have become an inherent part of cryptocurrency for a long time but they now come in many different flavours (DAI, TUSD, sUSD, bUSD, USDC and so on) which means there is a much bigger need for crypto users to move from a stable coin to another. Centralised exchanges tend to have high fees which are problematic for those trying to move from a stable coin to another. As a result, Curve.fi has become the best place to exchange stable coins because of its low fees and low slippage.   More recently, Curve launched v2 Crypto Pools to bring the same simplicity and efficiency of Curve's stablecoin pools to transactions between differentially priced assets (ie BTC and ETH). These pools are sufficiently different to justify their own section:    Where can I find Curve smart contracts?    The  Github repository  also open sources the bulk of Curve development activity.

Home             CRV Token              CRV & veCRV FAQ   What is the purpose and utility of CRV?    The main purposes of the Curve DAO token are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Curve Finance platform as well as getting as many users involved as possible in the governance of the protocol.   It also has time-weighted voting for governance and accrues a portion of the Curve Finance fees generated when locked as veCRV.   How to get CRV?    CRV can be acquired in two ways:     Bought off the market from an exchange   As a reward for being a Liquidity provider in CRV with pools or lending markets that have CRV rewards. This ensures the protocol continues offering low fees and extremely low slippage.     Where can I find the release schedule?    You can find the release schedule for the next six years at this address on the main UI:  https://dao.curve.fi/inflation .   There is also detailed documentation in the  Supply & Distribution  about the CRV emissions for the next 10 years, and the  supply calculator  can be used to see the emissions for any year.   What is the current circulating supply?    There are three ways to check the circulating supply:       On the main UI here:  https://dao.curve.fi/inflation .       In the  supply calculator  in these resources by looking at the statistics for today.       The  on-chain contract  ( 0x14139EB676342b6bC8E41E0d419969f23A49881e ) which shows the circulating supply, net of locked or otherwise vested tokens.       When was CRV launched?    CRV was officially launched on the 13 th  of August 2020.   What is CRV vote-locking?    \"Vote-locking\" refers to the process of locking CRV for a specified period to receive veCRV. The longer they lock for, the more veCRV they receive. Vote locking allows you to vote in governance, boost your CRV rewards and receive trading fees.  Vote-locking boost  is when users with veCRV (vote-locked CRV) receive boosted rewards when they provide liquidity to a pool/lending market.     veCRV is not transferable   When you lock your CRV tokens for voting, you will receive veCRV based on the lock duration. The veCRV tokens are  non-transferable . Once the lock period has ended, users can reclaim their CRV tokens.     What is the vote locking boost?    When vote locking CRV, you will also earn a boost on your provided liquidity of up to 2.5x. The goal is to incentivize users to participate in governance by rewarding them with a bigger share of the daily CRV inflation. See more  here   When did the boost start?    The boost was first applied on the 26 th  of August 2020 around 11pm UTC.   What are veCRV?    veCRV stands for voting escrow CRV. They are your CRV locked for voting. The longer you lock your CRV for, the more voting power you have (and the bigger boost you can reach). You can vote lock 1,000 CRV for a year to have a 250 veCRV weight. Each CRV locked for four years is equal to 1 veCRV.   The number of veCRV you will receive depends on how long you lock your CRV for. The minimum locking time is one week and the maximum locking time is four years.   Your veCRV weight gradually decreases as your escrowed tokens approach their lock expiry. A graph illustrating the decrease can be found at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/locker    How is your boost calculated?    To reach your maximum boost of 2.5x, there are several parameters to take into consideration. You can see the formula for boosting  here   You can find the current DAO voting power at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/locker    You can also find a calculator at this address:   https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc    What if I provide liquidity in multiple pools?    Your voting power applies to all gauges but may produce different boosts based on how much liquidity you are providing and how much total liquidity the pool has.   What happens if more people vote lock?    If other liquidity providers vote lock more CRV, your boost will stay what it was when you applied it. If you abuse this, another user can kick and force a boost update to take you down to your real boost.   How often does my boost records voting power changes?    Your voting weight decreases over time but your boost will take notice of your decreasing voting power at certain checkpoints like withdrawing, depositing into a gauge or minting CRV.   For example if you start at 1000 veCRV and your voting power decreases to 800 veCRV, your boost will still use your original voting power of 1000 veCRV until a user checkpoint.   How can I apply my boost?    After creating or adding to your lock, you need to click the apply boost button to update your boost on each of the gauge you're providing liquidity in. Your boost can also be updated by depositing or withdrawing from a gauge.   Click below for a guide on how locking and boosting your CRV rewards   Boosting your CRV Rewards   How to know my boost is active?    If your boost is showing then it is active.   If you have locked but your boost isn't showing then you need to apply it.   How does the yearly emissions reduction work?    The emissions reduction can be triggered by anyone after the time period (exactly 365 days) has elapsed since the last emissions reduction. This is done by calling the  update_mining_parameters  function on the  CRV  contract at the address  0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52 .   When this is called a new epoch is started, triggering another 365 days. If no one calls this function then CRV continues to be emitted at the current rate, and no new epoch is triggered. If for example this was triggered 1 day late it would affect two important functions:     The CRV supply will be higher than the theoretical maximum of 3,030,303,031.8 CRV   The next emissions reduction will be delayed by 1 as the 365 day countdown begins 1 day late.     This also means however, that each time a leap year happens the date at which someone can reduce the emissions will be brought forward one day of the year.   How is CRV minted?    CRV can be minted by users who stake in gauges after they are allocated some to mint. When this happens CRV tokens are minted into existence, added to the total supply and transferred to the user.   If users choose to not mint until a later date, this can create a discrepancy between the theoretical supply of tokens and the real supply of tokens shown on block explorers.

CRV was launched on August 13, 2020.   Supply    The total supply of 3.03 billion is distributed as such:     62% to community liquidity providers   30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting   5% to the community reserve   3% to employees with 2 years vesting             The initial supply of around 1.3b (~43%) was distributed as such:     5% to pre-CRV liquidity providers with 1 year vesting   30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting   3% to employees with 2 years vesting   5% to the community reserve     The circulating supply was 0 at launch and the initial release rate was around 2m CRV per day.   CRV inflation (community emissions for providing liquidity) started at 274 million tokens a year in 2020, and each year it decreases by roughly 16%.   See the  Supply & Distribution page  for more detailed information.   Utility    There are 4 main use-cases for CRV, most require locked CRV (veCRV):     Incentivizing liquidity providers  to provide liquidity to pools and lending markets through CRV rewards. This is how CRV tokens are distributed to the community.   Allowing liquidity providers to  boost their CRV rewards  up to 2.5x by holding veCRV.   Allowing users to participate and  vote in governance proposals  including directing CRV emissions (gauge weight votes) through holding veCRV.   Collecting a portion of the fees  from swaps and loans that occur on Curve through holding veCRV.       Info   veCRV stands for  vote-escrowed CRV , representing CRV tokens locked for voting in the Curve DAO. Locked CRV, Vote-locked CRV and vote-escrowed CRV all mean veCRV, these terms are used interchangeably throughout the ecosystem.

  CRV Token              CRV Supply and Distribution   There is a  fixed total supply of 3,030,303,031 CRV . No CRV tokens can ever be minted after that. The total supply of CRV tokens allocated to different groups is shown below in the \"CRV Total Allocation\" chart.  Not all CRV are currently minted or circulating . CRV tokens are slowly minted to the community each week and will continue to be released for over 200 years. The amount of tokens minted each week is defined in the  community emissions section .    Have a look over this page to learn about how CRV has been allocated and how much is distributed each week. The  Supply Calculator  is a great tool see the CRV supply and statistics on any date.   Total Supply Allocation    The below chart shows the total allocation of CRV to different groups within the Curve ecosystem.

Token Launch    CRV officially launched on the  13 th  of August 2020 . At the time of launch there were no unlocked tokens.  All  tokens in the launch were linearly vested for 1-4 years (gradually unlocking over a period of 1-4 years). The initial supply is quoted as 1,303,030,303 because these tokens were pre-mined and sent into the vesting contracts, which gradually unlocked them. Below shows the allocation to different groups of the initial distribution.                   Group   Allocated CRV   Vesting Years   Transactions           Early Users (pre-CRV liquidity providers)   151,515,152   1 1   1       Core Team   800,961,153   4   1       Investors   108,129,756   2    1  ,   2  ,   3        Employees   90,909,091   2    1  ,   2        Community Reserve   151,515,152   N/A 2   1       Total   1,303,030,303     1           The circulating supply was 0 at launch. Each day of the first year approx. 750k tokens were emitted to the community for providing liquidity and 1.65million tokens were vested (unlocked). Use the  supply calculator below  to see how quickly tokens became liquid and circulating.     Tip   6 year CRV release schedule is available here:  https://dao.curve.fi/releaseschedule , or the full release schedule is available as a google spreadsheet  here .       Community Emissions (CRV Inflation)    Community emissions (regularly called CRV Inflation) are minted and allocated to gauges based on the weekly weight gauge vote. Gauges have a very flexible design and can direct emissions to liquidity pools and suppliers of a lending market, or even to funding for the Vyper programming language.   Community emissions reduce each year. They are modelled off the Bitcoin Halving which halves the allocation every 4 years, in Curve however, we reduce rewards by  \\(2^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\)  every 365 days instead. This works out to be approx. 16% each year and 50% every 4 years. Community emissions were initially set at 274,815,283 CRV for the first year. This means the formula for how much CRV is emitted to the community in any year is:   \\[\\text{Yearly Community Emissions} = \\frac{274,815,283}{2^{\\text{year}/4}}\\]   Where  year  is the number of years after 13 th  August 2020, e.g., year 1 emissions are for the period 13 th  August 2021 until 13 th  August 2022. The emissions for year 10 are for the period of 11 th  August 2030 - 11 th  August 2031 (2 leap years with 366 days, yet Curve assumes all years have 365 days), this would come to 48,580,938 CRV emitted for that year.   In the smart contracts the yearly community emissions is not defined, it's actually defined as a rate of CRV emitted per second, we can convert between the yearly and per second value using the following formula:   \\[\\text{Emission Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Yearly Community Emissions}}{365 \\times 84600}\\]   We divide by  \\(365 \\times 84600\\)  because there is 365 days in a year and 86400 seconds in a day.   The emission rate has 18 decimal places, this means that  emissions continue for 245 years . The emission rate will be 0.000000000000000001 CRV/sec in year 2265.  Emissions are hardcoded and cannot change . See the  notable emission years  below, or have a play with the  supply calculator  to see how much CRV will be distributed and to who in different years.   See  this section  of the FAQ for how the yearly reduction works. See  this section  for how CRV is minted and added to the supply.   CRV Emissions for the next 10 years    See below for a chart of how the CRV will be distributed each year for the next 10 years. This year (2024), is the last year of the Core Team's CRV allocation vesting. After August 12 th , 2024 all CRV added to the circulating supply will be distributed to the community through gauges, and CRV inflation will fall dramatically from 20.37% to 6.34% for the year.   Note: dashed lines are percentage values and relate to the percentage axis, other lines relate to the CRV amount axis, click on datasets to turn them on/off.

It does not pull data from the Ethereum blockchain. It may show slightly different values because users can wait any period of time before minting CRV from liquidity emissions, or unlocking claimable tokens from vesting contracts. It is also assumed that community reserve tokens are vested for a 1 year period. This is not completely true as they are vested for at least 1 year once allocated to a cause by the DAO.

Vested tokens are unlocked as the vesting time period elapsed.   Emissions/Emitted  - Emissions are CRV Inflation from newly minted CRV increasing the supply. Emitted are the CRV which were added to the supply.   Max CRV Supply  - Unchanging value, the max CRV that can exist.   Total CRV Circulating  - The total supply of CRV unlocked from vesting and released from community emissions. Including rewards that can currently be claimed/minted by users.   Total CRV Supply  - The amount of minted CRV which currently exists, including pre-mined CRV locked in vesting contracts.   Remaining CRV Emissions  - Remaining amount of CRV to be emitted to the community.   Remaining CRV Vesting  - Remaining CRV to be unlocked from vesting contracts.   Percentage of CRV Circulating  - Measure of the max CRV supply compared to the current circulating supply.  Total CRV Circulating  divided by  Max CRV Supply .   CRV Inflation Rate  - Measure of the yearly CRV emitted & vested compared to the current circulating supply.  Yearly CRV Emitted & Vested  divided by  Total CRV Circulating .                         This was vested through the public vesting contract        These tokens had no vesting themselves, but the contract they are allocated to creates other vesting contracts. When tokens are allocated from this pool they create a child vesting contract with a minimum 1 year vesting period.

Users can mint crvUSD by posting collateral and opening a loan within this protocol.   How does the crvUSD liquidation process differ from other debt-based stablecoins?    crvUSD uses an innovative mechanism to reduce the risk of liquidations. Instead of instantly triggering a liquidation at a specific price, a users collateral is converted into stablecoins across a smooth range of prices.   Simulations suggest most price drops would result in the loss of just a few percentage points worth of collateral value, instead of the instant and total loss implemented by the liquidation process common to most debt-based stablecoins.   How is crvUSD pegged to a price of $1?    The crvUSD peg is broadly protected by the fact that the protocol is always overcollateralized. The protocol employs a number of stabilization mechanisms to fine-tune this peg. One mechanism is to automatically adjust borrow rates based on supply and demand. The protocol also relies on Peg Keepers (see below section), which are authorized to burn or mint crvUSD based on market conditions.    Can other types of collateral be proposed for crvUSD? How does that process work?    Yes, other collateral markets can be proposed for crvUSD through governance. Contact the community support channels for additional information on the current process to propose new collateral types. Each approved collateral has its own crvUSD market.   What is a 'loan discount' and what impact does it have?    A 'loan discount' is a percentage applied to reduce the value of collateral for determining the maximum borrowable amount. A higher loan discount results in a lower borrowing limit, acting as a safety margin for lenders against collateral value declines.    The maximum amount that can be borrowed is also influenced by other factors, such as market conditions and asset volatility. For more details on these factors and their impact on borrowing, see the technical documentation at  https://docs.curve.fi/crvUSD/amm/ .     Liquidation Process    What is my liquidation price?    At the start of the crvUSD loan process, collateral is deposited and equally distributed over a range of prices, not just a single liquidation price. Should the price fall within this range, the collateral begins its conversion into crvUSD. This process aids in maintaining the loan's health and, under most conditions, wards off liquidation. As a result, there isn't one specific liquidation price.   When depositing collateral, how do I adjust and select my collateral deposit price range?    The price range can be optionally adjusted and customized during the initial loan creation process. In the UI, the advanced mode toggle provides further insights into this range. It also presents an Adjust button, enabling users to fine-tune their preferred price range.   What happens when the collateral price drops into my selected range? (soft-liquidation)    Each crvUSD market is linked to an Automated Market Maker (AMM). If the collateral price falls into the selected range, this collateral becomes tradable in the AMM. At this juncture, traders have the opportunity to acquire the collateral, substituting it with crvUSD. Consequently, the loan becomes collateralized by stablecoins, known for their more reliable value retention, contributing to the sustained health of the loan.   What happens if the collateral price recovers? (de-liquidation)    As the collateral price increases, the aforementioned process reverses. The position undergoes trading through the AMM, transitioning from crvUSD back to the original form of collateral. Owing to AMM trading fees, it's typical for a slight percentage of the original collateral value to be diminished once the collateral price surpasses the upper limit of the predetermined liquidation range.   Under what circumstances can I be liquidated? (hard-liquidation)    Should a loan's health drop below 0%, it becomes eligible for liquidation. In this scenario, the collateral is sold off, and the position closes. Although the crvUSD collateral conversion mechanism within the AMM is designed to protect against liquidations, it might not keep up with severe price fluctuations. It is advisable for borrowers to maintain their loan health, especially when prices fall within the selected liquidation range.   How do I maintain my loan health if collateral price drops into my range?    When the collateral price falls into the liquidation range, adding new collateral to protect loan health is not permitted. Within this liquidation range, loan health can only be improved by repaying crvUSD. Even minimal crvUSD repayments can be effective in preventing liquidation while the collateral price resides within this range.   What happens to the collateral in the event of hard liquidation?    In the event of a hard liquidation, all available collateral is sold off by the AMM system, the debt is covered, and the loan is closed.   What is a liquidation discount and how is the 'liquidation discount' calculated during a liquidation?    The 'liquidation discount' is calculated based on the collateral's market value and is designed to incentivize liquidators to participate in the liquidation process. This factor is used to effectively discount the collateral valuation when calculating the health for liquidation purposes.   In other protocols, this may be referred to as a liquidation threshold and is often hard-coded instead of calculated dynamically.     Peg Keepers    What are Peg Keepers?    The Peg Keepers are contracts uniquely enabled to mint and absorb debt in crvUSD for the purposes of trading near the peg.   Under what circumstances can the Peg Keepers mint or burn crvUSD?    Each Peg Keeper targets a specific  Peg Keeper pool . A Peg Keeper pool is a  Curve v1 pool  allowing trading between crvUSD and a blue chip stablecoin. The Peg Keepers are responsible for trying to balance these pools by trading at a profit. The Peg Keepers can only mint crvUSD to trade into their associated pools when its pool balance of crvUSD is too low, or it can repurchase and burn the crvUSD if its pool balance is too high.   What is the relationship between a Peg Keeper's debt and the total debt in crvUSD?    A Peg Keeper's debt is the amount of crvUSD it has deposited into a specific pool. Total debt in crvUSD includes all outstanding crvUSD that has been borrowed across the system.   What does it mean if the Peg Keeper's debt is zero?    If a Peg Keeper's debt is zero, it means that the Peg Keeper has no outstanding debt in the crvUSD system.   How does Peg Keeper trade and distribute profits?    Every Peg Keeper has a public  update  function. If the Peg Keeper has accumulated profits, then a portion of these profits are distributed at the behest of the user who calls the  update  function, in order to incentivize distributed trading in the pools.      Calling  update()  via Etherscan   To access this information on Etherscan, one can visit the  LLAMMA details  on the crvUSD UI within any market. By clicking the Monetary Policy, users are directed to the contract on Etherscan. There, under the  Contract  tab, they should select the  Read Contract  tab. Function 6 ( peg_keepers ) requires the index value of the market of interest, ranging from 0 to n-1, where n represents the number of crvUSD markets. After entering this index and navigating to the returned address, users need to navigate to  Contract  and  Read Contract  again. This time, they access function 6 ( estimate_caller_profit ) to estimate the caller profit. After evaluating if the execution of the following function makes sense, the  Write Contract  tab must be selected, a wallet connected, and function 1 ( update ) called.       Borrow Rate    What is the Borrow Rate?    The Borrow Rate is the variable interest rate charged on active loans within each collateral market.   How is the crvUSD Borrow Rate calculated?    The Borrow Rate for each crvUSD collateral market is calculated based on a series of parameters, including the Peg Keeper's debt, the total debt, and the market demand for borrowing.     Safety and Risks    What are the risks of using crvUSD    As with all cryptocurrencies, crvUSD carries several risks, including depeg risks and risk of user collateral liquidation. Make sure to  read the disclaimer  and exercise caution when interacting with smart contracts.   How can I best manage my risks when providing liquidity or borrowing in crvUSD?    Best risk management practices include maintaining a safe collateralization ratio, understanding the potential for liquidation, and keeping an eye on market conditions.   Has crvUSD been audited?

There are Soft-liquidations (including de-liquidations) and Hard-liquidations. This page defines them and shows examples.   Soft-Liquidation    When the position enters Soft-liquidation it's a warning. The system will try to protect user loans by converting the original collateral to the borrowed asset as prices decrease, and back to the original collateral as prices increase.       <<<<<<< HEAD:docs/lending/liquidations.md  Hard Liquidation does not happen at the bottom of the soft-liquidation range .   Hard-liquidation can only occur when the health goes below 0 . If the health is negative anyone can pay off the debt and claim the collateral backing the loan, this should always be profitable, but in rare circumstances it may not be, if this happens it's called  bad debt .    In Soft-liquidation and de-liquidation, collateral will slowly be lost to fees from swapping back and forth as prices move higher and lower, this is how health deteriorates over time.  Health can deteriorate very quickly when volatility is high . More information on health can be found  here .   The  soft-liquidation applet  also simulates how Collateral is converted through the soft-liquidation range.     Hard-Liquidation    Soft-liquidation turns into Hard-liquidation when health is 0% . In Hard-liquidation the borrower keeps their borrowed assets (normally crvUSD) but loses their collateral.    Hard-liquidation does not trigger at the bottom of the Soft-liquidation range, it only relies on health . A user can have all their collateral fully converted to their borrowed asset and be below the Soft-liquidation range if they manage their health carefully.   Health can be increased in soft-liquidation by repaying some or all debt.     Hard-Liquidation Example    Hard-liquidation can only occur when the health of a loan is 0% or below . If the health is 0% or below anyone can pay off the debt and claim the collateral backing the loan, this should always be profitable, but in rare circumstances it may not be, if this happens it's called  bad debt .                 d2b17a00c34b7115c80b1aa476e71ed87bf0d546:docs/crvusd/liquidations.md                 The example below shows a loan in the CRV/crvUSD lending market which was hard-liquidated. The chart is interactive, by hovering over prices, you can see how the health of the loan decreases over time. See that hard-liquidation only relies on health.  The bottom of the soft-liquidation range is not where hard-liquidation happens.   Hard-liquidation - Borrowing crvUSD using CRV         It is always better to self-liquidate a loan before a loan is hard-liquidated . This is because the health calculation values your collateral lower than its actual worth. In this example, the borrower would have gotten back 11,107 crvUSD more if they had self-liquidated their loan instead of letting it be hard-liquidated.     Managing Health & Self-Liquidation Example    The below example shows how to manage health and how self-liquidation works, this shows a loan in the WETH/crvUSD lending market. When the user got into soft-liquidation they decided to repay around 10% of their debt, this increased their health from approx. 3% to 13%, but kept their soft-liquidation range the same. They then stayed in soft-liquidation for a long time, so they self-liquidated.  If some debt is repaid while in soft-liquidation the range will stay the same but health will increase , if debt is repaid outside the soft-liquidation range, the range will move lower.   Self-liquidating here was a good idea, this is because they already had 38,857 crvUSD as collateral (from swapped WETH in soft-liquidation), and their debt was 98,299 crvUSD, they only had to send 59,442 crvUSD and they received back their 24.3371 WETH. If they chose to repay they would have had to repay all 98,299 crvUSD of debt, and received all collateral back (38,857 crvUSD and 24.3371 WETH) in return.

After the collateral amount is set, the interface displays the maximum amount of crvUSD that can be borrowed, along with the health and borrow rate of the loan.             The user interface (UI) features a dropdown menu for viewing additional loan parameters, such as the current Oracle Price and  Borrow Rate .             In the upper right-hand side of the screen, there is a toggle button for advanced mode.               The advanced mode adds an additional display with more information about the current distribution across all the  bands  within the entire  LLAMMA .           It also expands the loan creation interface by displaying the  liquidation and band range ,  number of bands ,  borrow rate , and  Loan to Value ratio (LTV) . Additionally, users can manually select the number of bands for the loan by pressing the  adjust  button and using the slider to increase or decrease the number of bands.               Tip   A  higher number of bands results in fewer losses when the loan is in soft-liquidation  mode, see  here . The maximum number of bands is 50, while the minimum is 4.     Loan Management    Everything needed to manage a loan is available in this interface. The features include:             Loan    This tab provides options to  Borrow more  crvUSD,  Repay  debt, or  Self-liquidate  a loan   Collateral  Options to  add  or  remove  collateral from a loan are available here.   Deleverage    This tab facilitates loan deleveraging. Find more details  here .     Soft-Liquidation Mode   During soft-liquidation, users are unable to add or withdraw collateral.  They can choose to  either partially or fully repay  their crvUSD debt to improve their health ratio  or  decide to  self-liquidate  their loan if their collateral composition contains sufficient crvUSD to cover the outstanding debt. If they opt for self-liquidation, the user's debt is fully repaid and the loan will be closed. Any residual amounts are then returned to the user.     Leveraging Loans    The UI offers a leveraging feature for loans, accessible by navigating to the  Leverage  tab.   More information on how to deleverage a loan  here .     Leverage   Collateral can be leveraged  up to 9x , depending on the number of bands chosen. If a user wants to use the maximum leverage (9x), they loan will have the minimum number of bands (4). Using the highest number of bands (50) only allows for a leverage of up to 3x.  For the consequences of using different numbers of bands, see  here .     The process of leveraging effectively involves  repeat trading of crvUSD for collateral and depositing it to maximize the collateral position . Essentially, all borrowed crvUSD is utilized to acquire more collateral.      Warning   Caution is advised, as a dip in the collateral price would necessitate repaying the entire amount to reclaim the initial position.       A good explainer how leveraging works           Toggling the advanced mode expands the display to show additional information about the loan, including the price impact, trade route and the actual leverage.           Deleveraging Loans    Deleveraging a loan  irrespective of it being  leveraged   is an option available through the UI. Users must navigate to the 'Deleverage' tab and input the amount of collateral they intend to allocate for deleveraging. This particular collateral is then converted into crvUSD, which is used to facilitate debt repayment.               Info   When a user's loan is in soft-liquidation, deleveraging is only possible if the loan is fully repaid.  Apart from that, the loan can typically be self-liquidated. If the position is not in soft-liquidation, the user can deliberately deleverage by any chosen amount.     The UI will provide the user with their updated loan details, such as liquidation and band range, borrow rate, and health, as well as the LLAMMA changes of collateral and debt.

Loan Details    When a user creates a loan, their  collateral is allocated across a range of bands (liquidation prices) . Should the asset price fall within this range, the loan will enter soft-liquidation mode. In this state, the user is not allowed to add additional collateral. The only recourse is to either repay with crvUSD or to self-liquidate the loan.             The section on the bottom of the page provides information about the entire  LLAMMA  system, showing aspects such as the total amount of debt, along with individual wallet balances.   When a position was or is in soft-liquidation mode, losses occur. The UI displays the total  LOSS AMOUNT  as well as the  % LOST , which measures the loss in collateral value caused by the soft-liquidation process.             On the upper right-hand side of the screen, switching to advanced mode provides additional details about the loan.             In advanced mode the UI shows more information about the  collateral bands .             Advanced mode also adds a tab with more info about the entire  LLAMMA .               crvUSD Concepts    Market Parameters    Each crvUSD market has the following parameters which affect all loans and change automatically due to market forces:     Base Price:  The base price is the upper price limit of band number 0. Borrow rate increases the base price over time.   Oracle Price:  The oracle price is the current price of the collateral as determined by the oracle. The oracle price is used to calculate the collateral's value and the  loan's health .   Borrow Rate:  The borrow rate is the annual interest rate charged on the loan. This rate is variable and can change based on market conditions. The borrow rate is expressed as a percentage. For example, a borrow rate of 7.62% means that the user will be charged 7.62% interest on the loan's outstanding debt. See  here  for how it's calculated.     Each market also has the following parameters which only change if the CurveDAO votes them to change:     A:  The amplification parameter A is used to calculate the density of liquidity and  band  width, as well as the  maximum LTV  of a market.   Loan Discount:  The loan discount defines how much the collateral is discounted when taking a loan, it is directly related to the maximum LTV of each crvUSD market. See  here  for more information.   Liquidation Discount:  The liquidation discount is used to discount the collateral when calculating the health of the loan. See the  health section  for more information.   Sigma:  Sigma changes how quickly rates increase and decrease when crvUSD depegs. With a higher sigma interest rates will increase slower when crvUSD depegs. See  here  for more information.     LLAMMA and Liquidations    LLAMMA ( Lending-Liquidating AMM Algorithm ) is a fully functional two-token AMM containing the collateral token and crvUSD, which is  responsible for the liquidation mechanism . For more detailed documentation, please refer to the  technical docs .   When creating a new loan, the put-up  collateral will be deposited into a specified number of bands across the AMM . Unlike regular liquidation, which has a single liquidation price, LLAMMA has multiple liquidation ranges (represented by the bands) and  continuously liquidates the collateral if needed . All bands have lower and upper price limits, each representing a \"small liquidation range.\" The user's total liquidation range is represented by the upper price of the highest band to the lower price of the lowest band.   A loan only  enters soft-liquidation mode once the price of the collateral asset is within a band . If the price is outside the bands, there is no need to partially liquidate and therefore not in soft-liquidation.   The AMM works in a way that the collateral price within the AMM and the \"regular price\" are treated a bit differently. If the price falls into a band, prices are adjusted in a way that external arbitrageurs are incentivized to sell the collateral token and buy crvUSD in the band. So,  if the price is within a band, the user's collateral will be sold for crvUSD , meaning the user's collateral is now a combination of both tokens. This happens for each individual band the user has liquidity deposited into.   This liquidation process does not only happen when prices fall but also when they rise again . If the collateral in a band has been fully converted into crvUSD and the collateral price rises again, the earlier sold-off collateral will be bought up again.   In short: External traders will soft-liquidate a users collateral when the collateral token's price is falling and de-liquidate it again when prices rise again.     Losses in Soft-Liquidation   Positions in soft-liquidation / de-liquidation are suffering losses due to the selling and buying of collateral. If the position is not in soft-liquidation, no losses occur. These losses decrease the health of the loan. Once a user's health is at 0%, the user's position may face a hard-liquidation, which closes the loan.     Hard Liquidations    Hard liquidations occur when the  health  of a loan falls below 0%, allowing a liquidator to liquidate the loan. Anyone can act as a liquidator and liquidate eligible loans, but this is typically done by searchers.   When a liquidator initiates the process, the following occurs within a single transaction, using a market with WETH collateral and crvUSD debt as an example:     Any collateral which has been swapped to crvUSD in soft liquidation is transferred to Curve and removed from the user.   The remaining crvUSD debt is repaid to Curve by the liquidator.   The liquidator receives the remaining WETH collateral as a reward, which is normally more than the amount repaid.     This process is illustrated in the image below:       Bad Debt    Bad debt occurs when a loan is not profitable to liquidate . This could happen for many reasons, including gas prices being higher than the profit from a liquidation, a sequencer being down on an L2, or simply no one searching for profitable liquidations in a new market. It looks like the following:       In this example no rational liquidator will begin the liquidation process because they will lose value by doing so.   crvUSD is only minted on Ethereum and uses high-quality assets with strong liquidity to mitigate the risk of bad debt. Due to these precautions,  bad debt is not expected to occur within the crvUSD minting system . However, bad debt can and has occurred within specific Curve Lending markets, as they are permissionless and do not affect the integrity of the crvUSD stablecoin.     Bands (N)    When creating a loan, the added collateral is spread among the number of bands selected. Minimum amount is 4 bands, and the maximum amount is 50 bands.   A band essentially is a price range, with an upper and lower price limit . If the price of the collateral is within the limits of a band, that particular band is likely to be liquidated.   Note that band price ranges drift higher over time as base price increases by the borrow rate             In the illustration above, there are multiple bands with different price ranges. The light grey areas represent the collateral token, which in this example is ETH. As depicted, the bands below the collateral token's price are entirely in ETH since there is no need for liquidation, given the higher price. The dark grey areas represent crvUSD. Because the price of ETH fell within the band on the far right, the deposited collateral (ETH) is converted into crvUSD. In this instance, the band consists of both ETH and crvUSD. If the price continues to decline, all collateral in the band will be fully converted into crvUSD, and the band to the left will undergo soft-liquidation.   Remember: When prices rise again, the opposite is happening. The ETH which was converted into crvUSD earlier will be converted back into ETH again.         A band which has fully been soft-liquidated. All collateral was converted into crvUSD because the price of the collateral is below the liquidation range.           A band which currently is in soft-liquidation. It contains both, the collateral token and crvUSD.           A band which has not been liquidated yet (composition is 100% collateral token). The price of the collateral is above the liquidation range.     Band Formulae:    A  controls the density of the liquidity. This is directly related to the width of the bands. Band width at any price can be estimated to be:   \\[\\text{bandwidth} \\approx \\frac{\\text{price}}{\\text{A}}\\]   To find the exact  upper price limit  and  lower price limits  of the bands the following formulae can be used:   \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{upperLimit} &= \\text{basePrice} * \\left( \\frac{A-1}{A} \\right)^{n} \\\\ \\text{lowerLimit} &= \\text{basePrice} * \\left( \\frac{A-1}{A} \\right)^{n+1}\\end{aligned}\\]   Where:     \\(\\text{basePrice}\\) : The current base price of the desired market   \\(A\\) : The amplification factor of the desired market (default is 100)   \\(n\\) : The Band Number, e.g.,  \\(-\\) 67.     Band Calculator    Use the calculator below to simulate how bands are shaped and how liquidity density changes with different parameters. By definition the liquidity density will be 100% at band 1. Liquidity density increases as band width decreases as more collateral will be spread over a smaller price range.       Inputs:       A :      N :      Base Price ($):             Loan Health    Based on a user's collateral and debt amount, the UI will display a health score and status. If the position is in soft-liquidation mode, an additional warning will be displayed. Once a loan reaches  0% health , the loan is  eligible to be hard-liquidated . In a hard-liquidation, someone else can pay off a user's debt and, in exchange, receive their collateral. The loan will then be closed.   The  health of a loan decreases when the loan is in soft-liquidation mode. These losses do not only occur when prices go down but also when the collateral price rises again, resulting in the de-liquidation of the user's loan.  This implies that the health of a loan can decrease even though the collateral value of the position increases. If a loan is not in soft-liquidation mode, then no losses occur.   Losses are hard to quantify. There is no general rule on how big the losses are as they are dependent on various external factors such as how fast the collateral price falls or rises or how efficient the arbitrage is. But what can be said is that the  losses heavily depend on the number of bands  used; the more bands used, the fewer the losses. Daily losses based on current data are shown  here .   The formula for health is below, this is visualized in the Health Calculator applet as well.   \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{health} &= \\frac{s \\times (1-\\text{liqDiscount}) + p}{\\text{debt}} - 1 \\\\ p &= \\text{collateral} \\times \\text{priceAboveBands} \\end{aligned}\\]   Where:     \\(\\text{collateralValue}\\)  : the value of all collateral at the current LLAMMA prices   \\(\\text{liqDiscount}\\)  : the liquidation discount for the market (how much to discount the collateral value for safety during hard-liquidation).   \\(\\text{debt}\\)  : the debt of the user   \\(s\\)  : an estimation of how much crvUSD a user would have after converting all collateral through their bands in soft-liquidation. This can be very roughly estimated as:  \\(\\text{collateral} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{softLiqUpperLimit} - \\text{softLiqLowerLimit}}{2} \\right)\\)   \\(p\\)  : The value above the soft-liquidation bands. Found by multiplying the amount of collateral by how far above soft-liquidation the current price is. If user is in or below soft-liquidation, this value is 0.   \\(\\text{collateral}\\)  - The amount of collateral a user has, e.g., if a user has 5 wBTC, this value is 5.   \\(\\text{priceAboveBands}\\)  - The price difference between the oracle price and the top of the user's soft-liquidation range (upper limit of top band). This value is 0 if user is in soft-liquidation. See applet below for a visual representation.   \\(\\text{collateralPrice}\\)  - The price of a single unit of the collateral asset, e.g., if the collateral asset is wBTC, this value is the price of 1 wBTC.     Health Calculator    Use the applet below to simulate how health works, soft-liquidation losses are given as numbers in a comma separated list, the first number is the starting band onwards. The light blue shaded areas in the bands represent the value without using the soft-liquidation discounts, while the dark blue areas are the values after discounting.     Inputs:           A:         Starting Band:         Oracle Price ($):         Collateral Amount:         Debt ($):             Base Price ($):         Finish Band:         Liquidation Discount %:         Soft Liquidation Losses (%):                         Health  (including value above bands):   Health  (not including value above bands):                         The Curve UI will either show health adding value above bands or without that value based on how close to liquidation a user is. If the active band (Oracle price band) is 3 or less bands away from the user's soft liquidation bands, the UI will show the health not including value above bands. Otherwise it will show the health including the value above bands.   The health values on the Curve UI and within smart contracts will always be slightly less than the values here. Health is calculated by estimating the amount of crvUSD/debt tokens the collateral will be swapped for in each band. This takes into account how much liquidity is in each band, the more liquidity in a band the less slippage Curve estimates will occur. This slippage estimation slightly reduces a user's health.     Loan Discount    The  loan_discount  is used for finding the maximum LTV a user can have in a market. At the time of writing in crvUSD markets this value is a constant 9%, in Curve Lending markets this value ranges from 7% for WETH to 33% for volatile assets like UwU. Use the calculator below to see the maximum LTVs a user can have based on the  loan_discount , amplification factor  A  and their number of bands  N . The formula is:   \\[\\text{maxLTV} = 1 - \\text{loan_discount} - \\frac{N}{2*A}\\]     Maximum LTV Calculator   Inputs:       A:     N:     Loan Discount % :         Result     Maximum LTV:          Borrow Rate    The general idea is that  borrow rate increases when crvUSD goes down in value and decreases when crvUSD goes up in value . Also, contracts called  PegKeepers  can also affect the interest rate and crvUSD peg by minting and selling crvUSD or buying and burning crvUSD.   The formula for the borrow rate is as follows:   \\[\\begin{aligned}r &= \\text{rate0} * e^{\\text{power}} \\\\ \\text{power} &= \\frac{\\text{price}_\\text{peg} - {\\text{price}_\\text{crvUSD}}}{\\text{sigma}} - \\frac{\\text{DebtFraction}}{\\text{TargetFraction}} \\\\ \\text{DebtFraction} &= \\frac{\\text{PegKeeperDebt}}{\\text{TotalDebt}}\\end{aligned}\\]   with:     \\(r\\) : The interest rate.   \\(\\text{rate0}\\) : The rate when PegKeepers have no debt and the price of crvUSD is exactly 1.00.   \\(\\text{price}_\\text{peg}\\) : Desired crvUSD price: 1.00   \\(\\text{price}_\\text{crvUSD}\\) : Current crvUSD price.   \\(\\text{sigma}\\) : variable which can be configured by the DAO, lower value makes the interest rates increase and decrease faster as crvUSD loses and gains value respectively.   \\(\\text{DebtFraction}\\) : Ratio of the PegKeeper's debt to the total outstanding debt.   \\(\\text{TargetFraction}\\) : Target fraction.   \\(\\text{PegKeeperDebt}\\) : The sum of debt of all PegKeepers.   \\(\\text{TotalDebt}\\) : Total crvUSD debt across all markets.     A tool to experiment with the interest rate model is available  here .     PegKeeper    A PegKeeper is a contract that helps stabilize the crvUSD price. PegKeepers are deployed for special Curve pools, a list of which can be found  here .   PegKeepers take certain actions based on the price of crvUSD within the pools. All these actions are fully permissionless and callable by any user.   When the price of crvUSD in a pool is above 1.00, they are allowed to take on debt by minting un-collateralized crvUSD and depositing it into specific Curve pools. This increases the balance of crvUSD in the pool, which consequently decreases its price.   If a PegKeeper has taken on debt by depositing crvUSD into a pool, it is able to withdraw those deposited crvUSD from the pool again. This can be done when the price is below 1.00. By withdrawing crvUSD, its token balance will decrease and the price within the pool increases.

What management style will they employ? Will they be actively managing their loan i.e., adding, removing collateral and repaying debt. Or will they be passively taking a loan and leaving it in  LLAMMA's  hands?     Risk and Management styles can be thought of as spectrums, and they can be visualized in the image below.      The above image shows 4 main quadrants:     High risk and Passive : This is a dangerous strategy, users employing this strategy typically max borrow and make very little changes to the loan until they close or are hard-liquidated. Some users are lucky and do well, but many are hard-liquidated. Use at your own risk.   High risk and Active : Users with these loans are borrowing close to the maximum allowed, and actively adding and removing collateral, and debt as required to keep a loan healthy.   Careful and Passive : These loans are typically at low LTV ratios so their soft-liquidation ranges are far below the current price. These loans generally don't need much management and users may only alter their loans after significant price changes.   Careful and Active : Users borrow at low LTV ratios but actively manage the loans by adding and removing capital and debt as required to keep away from soft-liquidation.     Example loans for each of the 4 quadrants are given in the  loan example section here . The section directly below shows soft-liquidation losses based on user data, so prospective users can estimate losses.     Actively managing loans is gas intensive   Actively managing loans is expensive when factoring in gas usage, loan size needs to be sufficient to offset this expense. As a general rule allow  \\(\\text{USD} \\approx \\text{gasPrice} \\times 4\\)  to add collateral or repay debt, e.g. if gasPrice is 10 gWei allow $40 to add collateral or repay debt.       Soft Liquidation Losses    The data from all crvUSD loans so far has shown that for each band range a user can expect the following losses in the table below. Loss amount doesn't seem to be affected by the collateral asset used (i.e., losses from wBTC seem to be the very similar as wstETH). The band range was the biggest factor in how a user performed. The histogram and table below show  soft-liquidation losses are generally very low , but keep in mind that high volatility periods can cause double digit losses.    Note: you can show and hide any band ranges by clicking on them in the legend .          Use percent of data for y axis       Use days of data (time) for y axis                  band range   days of soft liq data   min loss/day   median loss/day   mean loss/day   std loss/day   max loss/day           4-9   4601.17   0%   0.0927%   0.93%   2.18%   38.93%       10-19   2248.19   0%   0.0331%   0.62%   1.98%   43.06%       20-35   124.92   0%   0.0127%   0.20%   0.54%   6.41%       36-50   114.99   0%   0.0004%   0.11%   0.30%   3.98%           Using more bands ( \\(\\uparrow\\) N) reduce your soft-liquidation loss per day but increase the time in soft-liquidation, while also reducing the total amount a user can borrow . It is up to the user to choose a comfortable number of bands which allows them to borrow their required amount.   The above results are from the notebook  here   Managing Loan Health    Loan health  is a direct measure of the risk of a loan . The lower the loan health, the riskier the loan. To keep from being hard-liquidated, a loan must have a health above 0.    There are 2 factors which influence the health of a loan:     LTV (Loan-To-Value ratio) - More collateral and less debt increases the health of the loan   Increasing the  a  distance as shown on the figure  here . This can be done in 2 ways: reducing the number of bands, reducing the amount borrowed.     There are 2 ways of increasing the health of a loan:     Repaying debt   Adding collateral     However if a loan is in soft-liquidation collateral cannot be added, debt must be repaid to increase the health.     Loan Examples    All the charts provided in this section are interactive.   Click on different items in the legend to show/hide that plot.   Here's a list of the plots that can be shown/hidden and their meaning:   Value (Left Axis) plots :   These plots only relate to the left axis, the percentage axis has no meaning for them .     Oracle Price : The oracle price for 1 unit of the chosen deposited collateral asset (e.g., 1 wBTC, 1 wstETH, etc)   Soft-Liquidation Price Range : This is the soft-liquidation price range of the user. This can also be thought of as all the small band ranges together. This drifts higher over time with the  Interest Rate .   CV in <asset> : The collateral value in the deposited asset (e.g., wstETH, wBTC, etc).   CV in crvUSD : The value of the crvUSD held as collateral.  <asset>  is swapped to crvUSD through the soft-liquidation process to protect from further declines in price.   Total CV : Total Collateral Value.  CV in <asset>  plus  CV in crvUSD .   Debt Value : The total amount of debt owed (this includes interest)   AAVE/Spark Liq Price : The price at which this loan would be liquidated in AAVE/Spark. When the  Oracle Price  is lower than this price, the loan would be liquidated/not possible.     Percentage (Right Axis) plots :  These plots only relate to the right axis, the value axis has no meaning for them     LTV : The loan to value ratio, this is the  Debt Value  divided by the  Total CV .   Health : The health factor of the loan, a loan is Hard-liquidated when this gets to 0, see  here  for more info.   % CV in <asset> : The percentage of  Total CV  currently in the deposited collateral asset (e.g., wstETH, wBTC, etc). This is  CV in <asset>  divided by  Total CV .   % CV in crvUSD : The percentage of  Total CV  currently swapped to crvUSD. This is  CV in crvUSD  divided by  Total CV .   % SL Collateral Loss : The percentage of collateral lost to soft-liquidation. See  here  for more information.   % Interest Collateral Loss : The collateral loss due to interest accruing on the debt. This amount is included in the  Debt Value  plot.   % Total Collateral Loss :  % SL Collateral Loss  plus  % Interest Collateral Loss .   % Max Deposited Collateral : This is the percentage of the current deposited collateral vs. the maximum that will get deposited over the life of the loan. This is shown as a percentage so it can be represented along side other plots. This is just to show the magnitude and timing of deposits/withdrawals, not exact amounts. An example would be if there were 20 wstETH deposited at the beginning, but the user deposits another 5 (total 25 wstETH) at another point without withdrawing any, this value will be start at  \\(20/25=80\\%\\) .   Interest Rate : The current borrow interest rate for the market.       Careful and Passive Loan Example    This user  deposited 188 wBTC  as collateral. They  borrowed 1.05 million crvUSD . They were very careful and only borrowed with a  21% LTV . They used  N=10 .         As you can see from above the user remained passive as they were far from soft-liquidation at all times. They only fee they incurred was from the borrow interest rate increasing their debt, but luckily wBTC price went up fast enough to offset that.    Throughout the approx. 100 day duration of the loan they increased their loan to 1.27 million crvUSD but their LTV actually went down as wBTC price went up ~30%.   This is a good strategy for loans less than 10,000 crvUSD  as gas costs for managing the loan are minimal.   Careful and Active Loan Example    This loan was opened with  N=50 ,  93 sfrxETH collateral ,  105500 crvUSD debt . This was a  LTV of 67% .         This user starts with 105k crvUSD debt, but slowly over time adds collateral and borrows more debt. Ending with 219 sfrxETH collateral and 298k crvUSD debt. They actively managed to stay out of soft-liquidation, and spend 0.56 ETH of fees on 32 transactions over this 2 month period. The only fees they incurred were from borrowing interest and Ethereum transactions fees.   This loan LTV is possible in other systems, but soft-liquidations aren't. Soft-liquidations reassure the user that they are protected from sudden price drops .   High Risk and Active Loan Example    This user opened their loan using  N=4 ,  deposited 20 wstETH , and  borrowed 32600 crvUSD . This equated to an  85% LTV .         The user with the loan pictured above is tracked over a period of ~102 days, during which they actively managed their loan to maintain an LTV around 85%. By taking a crvUSD loan, the user locked in 85% of the value of wstETH instantly while still benefiting from price increases on wstETH. This loan would not have been possible on other platforms due to the LTV of the wstETH collateral.   The user fell into soft-liquidation around the 15-day mark and experienced health erosion, the user repaid 10% of their debt on the 18 th  day, restoring their health. As the price of wstETH rose around the 70-day mark, the user decided to borrow more, changing their soft-liquidation range. They quickly repaid the newly added debt after falling into soft-liquidation in this higher range. Around the 85 th  day, the user chose to add more collateral and increased their debt.   Throughout this period, the user seemed comfortable in soft-liquidation, only losing ~22% of their collateral from soft-liquidation and borrowing interest. Their collateral was fully swapped to crvUSD multiple times, protecting them from further price declines.   LLAMMA saved the user from hard-liquidation that would have occurred in any other system, which can be seen by making the  AAVE/Spark Liquidation Price  plot visible. Even after reducing the LTV on the 18 th  day, the user would have been liquidated on other platforms by the two wicks below $1767 on the 25 th  and 55 th  days, preventing them from recouping value during the subsequent price appreciation.   This loan shows that  actively managing high risk loans can result in outcomes not possible in any other system .   High Risk and Passive Loan Example (Hard-liquidation)    This loan was opened with  N=4 ,  5.95 wstETH collateral ,  10500 crvUSD debt . This was a  LTV (Loan-To-Value) of 84% .         The user almost max borrowed. Putting their liquidation range very close to the current price. They stayed above their soft-liquidation range for a long time before falling into soft liquidation on day 50. They quickly fell through soft liquidation to the safety on the other side but lost 3.1% to soft liquidation fees.    At any time from day 50 to day 62 they could have repaid debt to increase their health. As they were passive and did nothing soft-liquidation fees reduced their health to 0 when going back up through their soft-liquidation range. This is an unfortunate situation where the increasing collateral price caused hard-liquidation.     Use this strategy at your own risk   Users in this quadrant are at the highest risk of hard-liquidation. Using this strategy is not advised.     Under Soft-Liquidation Loan Example    This loan started with  57.07 wstETH collateral , with  N=4  and  102k crvUSD debt . They paid off small amounts of debt a few times throughout the loan and finished with  93.5k crvUSD debt  and  53.44 wstETH collateral .         This loan is a great example of the power of LLAMMA and soft-liquidations. The user spent  more than 50% of the loan time under the soft-liquidation range . Yet the  loss from soft-liquidation fees was only 6.37% . While under the soft-liquidation range the user was shielded from any further losses in the wstETH price as all their collateral was converted to crvUSD. Yet when the price rose the user benefited from price increases as their collateral was swapped back to wstETH.   The AAVE/Spark Liq price plot for this loan shows that this loan would not be possible in competitor systems except from the 91 st  day when debt was lower and wstETH price rose.     Strategies    Borrowing to Lending Rate Arbitrage    As crvUSD is minted with high quality collateral in crvUSD markets, a user can usually make profit by minting crvUSD and supplying it elsewhere, especially to riskier markets. This strategy is simple, you borrow crvUSD and supply it at higher rates, making the difference:   \\[\\text{profitRate = supplyRate - borrowRate}\\]   Strategy:     Supply collateral (e.g., ETH, wBTC, wstETH) to a crvUSD market   Borrow crvUSD   Supply crvUSD to a market with a higher supplying rate than crvUSD borrow rates, e.g.,  Curve Lending Markets ,  Conic Omnipools ,  Silo Finance Markets .     Risks:     The user must monitor their loan health to stay out of any liquidations (soft or hard) as losses from liquidation may be larger than profit from the rate arbitrage.   crvUSD risk, i.e., smart contract risk from crvUSD stablecoin and the crvUSD markets, see crvUSD risk disclaimer  here   Smart contract and bad debt risk from lending markets, i.e., if you supply to Curve lending, see Curve Lending risk disclaimer  here .

Positions are managed passively: if the price of the collateral decreases, the loan automatically enters a  soft-liquidation  mode , wherein some of the collateral is converted to crvUSD. Conversely, if the collateral's price increases, the system reclaims the collateral by converting crvUSD back to the collateral token.   However, this process may incur some losses due to the soft-liquidations and de-liquidations.   Manage crvUSD positions at  https://crvusd.curve.fi/ .   Markets    On the  Markets  tab, all available collateral types are displayed.   The page displays the current  borrow rate , total debt, debt cap, remaining amount available for borrowing, and the total value of collateral.             If a user does not have an existing loan, clicking on any market will lead to the  loan creation  interface.   Should a loan already exist, a dollar sign overlay will appear on the left. Selecting the market in this case will lead to the  loan management  interface.   Risks      Please consider the following risk disclaimers when using the Curve Stablecoin infrastructure:     If your collateral enters soft-liquidation mode, you can't withdraw it or add more collateral to your position. Should the price of the collateral drop sharply over a short time interval, your position will get hard-liquidated, with no option of de-liquidation. Please choose your leverage wisely, as you would with any collateralized debt position.   If your collateral enters soft-liquidation mode, you can't withdraw it or add more collateral to your position.   Should the price of the collateral change drop sharply over a short time interval, it can result in large losses that may reduce your loan's health.   If you are in soft-liquidation mode and the price of the collateral goes up sharply, this can result in de-liquidation losses on the way up. If your loan's health is low, value of collateral going up could potentially reduce your underwater loan's health.   If the health of your loan drops to zero or below, your position will get hard-liquidated with no option of de-liquidation. Please choose your leverage wisely, as you would with any collateralized debt position.       The crvUSD stablecoin and its infrastructure are currently in beta testing. As a result, investing in crvUSD carries high risk and could lead to partial or complete loss of your investment due to its experimental nature. You are responsible for understanding the associated risks of buying, selling, and using crvUSD and its infrastructure.   The value of crvUSD can fluctuate due to stablecoin market volatility or rapid changes in the liquidity of the stablecoin.   crvUSD is exclusively issued by smart contracts, without an intermediary. However, the parameters that ensure the proper operation of the crvUSD infrastructure are subject to updates approved by Curve DAO. Users must stay informed about any parameter changes in the stablecoin infrastructure.

The creation wizard will guide you through the process of creating a pool, but if you have questions throughout you are encouraged to speak with a member of the Curve team in the  Telegram  or  Discord .   Stableswap pools are liquidity pools containing  up to eight tokens  using the StableSwap algorithm (Curve V1). For a better understanding of Curve V1, please see here:  Understanding Curve V1 .     Stableswap-NG   StableSwap-NG is an improved and refined version of the first StableSwap implementation. It is highly gas optimized and also includes dynamic fees which increases as liquidity utilization increases.       Tokens in Pool    The token selection tab can be used to select  between two and eight tokens . A token can be selected by searching for the symbol of any token that is already being used on Curve, or by pasting the pool's address. Additional tokens can be added through the blue  Add token  button.   When creating a metapool, only two tokens can be selected. One is the LP token, and the other is the token to pair against it.     Warning     ERC20:  Users are advised to do careful due diligence on ERC20 tokens that they interact with, as this contract  cannot differentiate between harmless and malicious  ERC20 tokens.   Oracle:  When using tokens with oracles, it is important to know that they  may be controlled externally by an EOA .   Rebasing:  Users and integrators are advised to understand how the AMM contract works with rebasing balances.   ERC4626:  Some ERC4626 implementations  may be susceptible to Donation/Inflation attacks . Users are advised to proceed with caution.         For the AMM to function correctly, the appropriate asset type needs to be chosen when selecting the assets. The following asset types are supported:   Standard ERC-20    Standard ERC-20 tokens do not need any additional configuration.             Tokens with Oracles      Oracle Precision   The precision of the rate oracle  must be  \\(10^{18}\\) . Otherwise, the liquidity pool will not function correctly, as the exchange rate will be broken.     Some tokens might require an external rate oracle to ensure correct calculations within the AMM. This is especially useful for tokens with rates against their underlying tokens, such as rETH against ETH. In this case, when selecting a token with an oracle, the corresponding box needs to be ticked, and an extra section for the contract address and oracle price method will appear. Some tokens might source their price oracle from a contract other than the token contract.             Rebasing Tokens    Rebasing tokens in crypto are cryptocurrencies that automatically adjust their supply periodically based on a predetermined algorithm, typically to maintain a stable value or peg to another asset.              ERC-4626    ERC-4626 is a standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults. It provides a standard API for tokenized yield-bearing vaults that represent shares of a single underlying ERC-20 token. When using these kinds of tokens, the pool calculates the underlying amount as if the underlying tokens were in the pool.               Parameters    Stableswap-NG offers three different default Pool Parameter Presets:                           Swap Fee ranging from 0% to 1% : The swap fee charged during transactions.   A ranging from 1 to 5,000 : The amplification coefficient, which defines the pool's density.   Offpeg Fee Multiplier from 0 to 12.5 : A multiplier that adjusts the Swap Fee based on the pool's state.   Moving Average Time ranging from 60 to 3600 seconds : The moving average time window for the built-in oracle.       Offpeg Fee Multiplier   Stableswap-NG introduces a  dynamic fee . The use of the  Offpeg Fee Multiplier  allows the system to dynamically adjust the fee based on the pool's state.   A tool to play around with the dynamic fee:  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zhrwbvcipo?       Pool Info    Finally, after setting all the parameters, a  Pool Name  and  Pool Symbol  can be chosen:               Deploying the Pool    On the right-hand side, there is a tab that summarizes all the tokens, parameters, and information.

For a better understanding of Curve v2, please see here:  Understanding Curve v2 .   Due to safety reasons, the use of plain ETH is no longer possible. Instead,  wrapped ETH (wETH)  needs to be used.     The following documentation will present a rundown of the process of creating such a pool using the  Pool Creation Interface :   Tokens in Pool    In the token selection tab, three tokens can be chosen. By default, the UI allows a user to select two tokens, but clicking on the blue  Add token  button will extend the token selection by one more token.               Parameters    The UI provides two presets for parameter values:               Tricrypto :  Suitable for pools containing a USD stablecoin, BTC (e.g., tBTC or wBTC), and ETH.   Three Coin Volatile :  Suitable for pools containing a volatile token paired with ETH and USD stablecoins.       On the parameters tab, you can review and adjust the predefined parameters from the preset. Crypto v2 pools contain many parameters. If you are uncertain which parameters to use, you may want to ask for help in any Curve channel before deploying.             The basic parameters include the fees charged to users who interact with the pool. This is divided dynamically into a  Mid fee  and  Out fee  parameter, which represent the minimum and maximum fees during periods of low and high volatility.     Mid Fee ranging from 0.005% to 3% : This is the minimum fee and is charged when the pool is perfectly balanced.   Out Fee ranging from 0.01% to 3% : This is the maximum fee and is charged when the pool is completely out of balance.     In CryptoSwap pools, the liquidity is concentrated. These initial liquidity concentration prices are fetched from  CoinGecko . If the tokens do not exist there or for some reason cannot be fetched, the user must set these values manually.     The Advanced toggle allows you to adjust several other parameters under the hood.     Tip   A great article on understanding parameters can be found here:  https://nagaking.substack.com/p/deep-dive-curve-v2-parameters?s=curve .                 Amplification Parameter (A) ranging from 4,000 to 400,000,000 : Larger values of A make the curve better resemble a straight line in the center (when the pool is near balance). Highly volatile assets should use a lower value, while assets that are closer together may be best with a higher value.   Gamma ranging from 0.00000001 to 0.002 : The gamma parameter can further adjust the shape of the curve. Default values recommend 0.000145 for volatile assets and 0.0001 for less volatile assets.   Allowed Extra Profit ranging from 0 to 0.01 : As the pool takes profit, the allowed extra profit parameter allows for greater values. Recommended 0.000002 for volatile assets and 0.00000001 for less volatile assets.   Fee Gamma ranging from 0 to 1 : Adjusts how fast the fee increases from Mid Fee to Out Fee. Lower values cause fees to increase faster with imbalance. Recommended value of 0.0023 for volatile assets and 0.005 for less volatile assets.   Adjustment Step ranging from 0 to 1 : As the pool rebalances, it must do so in units larger than the adjustment step size. Volatile assets are suggested to use larger values (0.000146), while less volatile assets do not move as frequently and may use smaller step sizes (default 0.0000055).   Moving Average Time ranging from 0 to 604,800 seconds : The price oracle uses an exponential moving average to dampen the effect of changes. This parameter adjusts the half-life used.       Pool Info    Finally, after setting all the parameters, a  Pool Name  and  Pool Symbol  can be chosen:               Deploying the Pool    On the right-hand side, there is a tab that summarizes all the tokens, parameters, and information. The pool can finally be deployed by pressing the blue  Create Pool  button at the bottom.             After deployment, make sure to seed initial liquidity and  create a gauge .

These pools can contain a variety of assets, including pegged tokens, unpegged tokens, and some pool tokens, for example 3crv. This interface supports deploying pools on most chains, although there might be some chains that are not supported yet.     Liquidity Pool Risks   Each liquidity pool brings risks with it. Before using or creating any pools, please read the  Risk Disclaimer .     Asset 1   Pool Creation Interface     To get started, visit the  Pool Creation  tab at the top of the Curve homepage, and select whether you would like to create a \"Stableswap Pool\" (a pool with pegged assets, e.g., crvUSD <> USDT) or a \"Cryptoswap Pool\" (containing assets whose prices may be volatile, e.g., CRV <> ETH).     Info   NG stands for New-Generation and represents enhanced and improved versions of prior implementations. All newly created pools are \"new-generation pools\".           Stableswap     Stableswap pools are liquidity pools containing up to eight pegged assets, for example crvUSD <> USDT <> USDC.     Getting started       Twocrypto NG     Twocrypto pools are liquidity pools containing two volatile assets, for example CRV <> ETH.     Getting started       Tricrypto NG     Tricrypto pools are liquidity pools containing three volatile assets, for example crvUSD <> BTC <> ETH.

Please note that Curve v1 and v2 pools do not rely on external price oracles.  Misuse of external price oracles is a contributing factor to several major DeFi hacks.  If you are looking to use Curves price oracle functions, or any price oracle, to provide on-chain pricing data in a decentralized application you are building, we recommend extreme caution.   Purpose     Curve v2 pools , which consist of assets with volatile prices, require a means of tracking prices. Instead of relying on external oracles, the pool instead calculates the price of these assets internally based on the trading activity within the pool.   This is tracked by two similar but distinct parameters:     Price Oracle:  The pools expectation of the assets price   Price Scale:  The price based on the pools actual concentration of liquidity     Pools keep track of recent trades within the pool as a variable called  last_prices . The  price_oracle  is calculated as an  exponential moving average  of recent trade prices. The  price_oracle  represents what the pool believes is the fair price of the asset .   In contrast,  price_scale  is a snapshot of how the liquidity in the pool is  actually  distributed. For this reason,  price_scale  lags  price_oracle . As users make trades, the pool calculates how to  profitably readjust liquidity , and the  price_scale  moves in the direction of the  price_oracle .     Price Oracle and Price Scale shown in the Curve UI   Exponential Moving Average    As discussed above, the  price_oracle  variable is calculated as an exponential moving average of  last_prices .   For comparison, traders commonly rely on a simple moving average as a technical analysis indicator, which calculates the average of a certain number points (ie, a 200-day moving average computes the average of the trailing 200 days of data).   The exponential moving average\" is similar, except it applies a weighting to emphasize newer data over older data. This weighting falls off exponentially as it looks further back in time, so it can react quicker to recent trends.     Updates    An internal function  tweak_price  is called every time prices might need to be updated by an operation which might adjust balances within a pool (hereafter referred to as a  liquidity operation ):     add_liquidity   remove_liquidity_one_coin   exchange   exchange_underlying     The  tweak_price  function is a gas expensive function which can execute several state changing operations to state variables_._   Price Oracle    The  price_oracle  is updated only once per block. If the current timestamp is greater than the timestamp of the last update, then  price_oracle  is updated using the previous  price_oracle value  and data from  last_prices .   The updated  price_oracle  is then used to calculate the vector distance from the  price_scale , which is used to determine the amount of adjustment required for the  price_scale .   Profits and Liquidity Balances    Curve v2 pools operate on profits. That is, liquidity is rebalanced when the pool has earned sufficient profits to do so. Every time a  liquidity operation  occurs, the pool chooses whether it should spend profits on rebalancing. The pools actions may be considered as an attempt to rebalance liquidity close to market prices.   Pools perform all such operations strictly with profits, never with user funds. Profits are occasionally claimed by administrators, otherwise funds remain in the pool. In other words, profits can be calculated from the following function:   profits == erc20.balanceOf(i) - pool.balances(i)   Internally, every time the  tweak_price  function is called during a  liquidity operation , the pool tracks profits. It then uses the updated profit values to consider if it should rebalance liquidity.   Specifically, pools carry a public parameter called  allowed_extra_profit  which works like a buffer. If the pools virtual price has grown by more than a function of profits and the  allowed_extra_profit  buffer value, then the pool is considered profitable enough to rebalance liquidity.   From here, the pool further checks that the  price_scale  is sufficiently different from  price_oracle , to avoid rebalancing liquidity when prices are pegged. Finally, the pool computes the updates to the  +  and how this affects other pool parameters. If profits still allow, then the liquidity is rebalanced and prices are adjusted.   Manipulation    We do not recommend using Curve pools by themselves as canonical price oracles. It is possible, particularly with low liquidity pools, for outside users to manipulate the price.   Curve pools nonetheless include protections against some forms of manipulation. The logic of the Curve  price_oracle  variable only updates once per block, which makes it more resistant to manipulation from malicious trading activity within a single block.   Due to the fact that changes to  price_oracle  are dampened by an  exponential moving average , attempts to manipulate the price may succeed but would require a prolonged attack over several blocks.     Actual $CVX price versus CVX-ETH Pool Price Oracle and Price Scale during rapid volatility   These safeguards all help to prevent various forms of manipulation. However, for pools with low liquidity, it is not difficult for whales to manipulate the price over the course of several transactions. When relying on oracles on-chain, it is safest to compare results among several oracles and revert if any is behaving unusually.   v1 Pools    Newer v1 Pools also contain a price oracle function, which also displays a moving average of recent prices. If the moving average price was written to the contract in the same block it will return this value, otherwise it will calculate on the fly any changes to the moving average since it was last written.   Curve v1 pools do not have a concept of price scale, so no endpoint exists for retreiving this value. Older v1 pools will also not have a price oracle, so use caution if you are attempting to retrieve this value on-chain.   LLAMMA    The LLAMMA use of oracles is quite different than Curve v2 pools in that it can utilize external price oracles. In LLAMMA, the  price_oracle  function refers to the collateral price (which can be thought of as the current market price) as determined by an external contract.   For example, LLAMMA uses  price_oracle  to convert $ETH to $crvUSD at a specific collateral price. When the external price is higher than the upper price (internally:  P_UP ), all assets in the band range are converted to $ETH. When the price is lower than the lower price (internally:  P_DOWN ), all assets are converted to $crvUSD. When the oracle price is in the middle, the current band is partially converted, with the exact proportion determined by price changes.     When the external price changes, an arbitrage opportunity exists. External arbitrageurs can deposit $ETH or $crvUSD to balance the pool, until the pool price reaches parity with the external price. LLAMMA applies an  exponential moving average  to the  price_oracle  to prevent users from absorbing losses due to drastic fluctuations.   More information on price oracles and other LLAMMA dynamics are  available at this article .

talking about in different social channels or in these resources or the technical documentation.   CurveV1    CurveV1 refers to first product Curve deployed, which was the stablecoin swap pools. This term is used to describe any stable asset swap pool, e.g., USDT/USDC/DAI, stETH/ETH.   CurveV2    CurveV2 was the second product Curve deployed, this was the cryptopool swap pools. Cryptopools are swap pools which have assets which are not stable to each other, e.g., BTC/ETH/USDT, CRV/ETH.   Stableswap    See  CurveV1 .   Cryptoswap    See  CurveV2   Liquid Lockers    Some projects offer to take CRV, lock it in a smart contract as veCRV and give a user tokens representing the veCRV in the smart contract. These are called liquid lockers because the underlying veCRV is locked but can be transferred (is liquid).   3CRV    3CRV is the LP token for the 3Pool (sometimes referred to as TriPool). Trading fees are distributed in 3CRV.   Admin fee    Admin fee is the share of trading fees that are received by governance participants who have locked their CRV (see veCRV).   Base Pools    Base pools are an old Curve concept, yet still working in some pools such as GUSD. Base pool tokens can be paired with other tokens to create new pools, e.g. 3crv pool token (USDT, USDC, DAI) paired with GUSD.   Boosting (also boosties)    The act of locking your CRV to earn more CRV on your provided liquidity.   Boosting your CRV Rewards   CRV    Governance and utility token for the Curve DAO.   DeFi (Decentralized Finance)    Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is an experimental form of finance that does not rely on financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, and instead utilizes blockchains, most commonly the Ethereum blockchain.   Metamask    Metamask is an Ethereum wallet that allows you to interact with Curve and other dapps. You can also use it with Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. It's the most popular Ethereum web wallet and is available as an add-on for most browsers.   Metapool    Metapools are a type of pool on Curve composed of one asset as well as as LP tokens from another pool.   Llamas    Llamas are wonderful and magical creatures. Each Curve team member must own at least one llama as part of their contract with Curve Finance.   LP (Liquidity provider)    Users providing liquidity (funds/assets) on the Curve or other DeFi protocols.   LP tokens (Liquidity provider token)    When you deposit into a Curve pool, you receive a counter party token which represents your share of the pool.   veCRV    Stands for vote-escrowed CRV. They are CRV locked for the purpose of voting and earning fees.   Understanding $CRV   Vote-locked CRV    This term is used interchangeably with Vote-escrowed CRV and veCRV.   Yearn    Yearn Protocol is a set of Ethereum Smart Contracts focused on creating a simple way to generate high risk-adjusted returns for depositors of various assets via best-in-class lending protocols, liquidity pools, and community-made yield farming strategies on Ethereum. It was founded by Andre Cronje who has been a long term collaborator of Curve Finance.

The Curve DAO has full access to these funds and can decide to award part of this fund through a proposal. Funds can only be distributed through linear vesting over a minimum duration of one year using a vesting contract.   The contract is deployed on Ethereum at  0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267 .   If you have a project you believe deserves a grant, please create a proposal or discuss it with a team member on   Discord  or   Telegram .

By doing so, participants can earn a boost on their provided liquidity and vote on all DAO proposals. Users who reach a voting power of 2,500 veCRV can also create new proposals. There is no  minimum voting power required to participate in voting. The duration of governance proposals is seven days .     Voting Power Decay   When voting on DAO proposals, a user's voting power on an individual proposal starts to decay halfway through the vote as a measure to protect against manipulation by whales. This does not apply to gauge weight votes. Additionally, overall voting power decays linearly over time. More details are provided in the section below.   Example:  A user begins the voting period for a proposal with 100 veCRV. If the voting duration is 7 days, their voting power will remain at 100 veCRV for the first 3.5 days. After this point, their voting power starts to decay linearly. By day 5.25 (which is halfway through the decay period), their voting power would have decreased to 50 veCRV. By the end of the 7-day voting period, the users voting power would have diminished further, approaching 0 veCRV.       Voting Power    veCRV stands for  vote-escrowed CRV . It's a mechanism where users can lock their CRV tokens for varying lengths of time to gain voting power. Users have the option to lock their CRV for a minimum of one week and a maximum of four years. Those with longer voting escrows wield more stake, thereby receiving greater voting power.   A user's voting power gradually decreases over time until it reaches zero at the time of unlock. For instance, if a user decides to lock 100 CRV for four years, they will initially receive 100 veCRV. After one year, due to the constant decay, the user's veCRV balance will reduce to 75 veCRV, then to 50 veCRV after two years, etc... until it finally zeroes out after four years.   The existing lock can be extended at every point in time, resulting in a increased veCRV balance again.     DAO Votes    There are three different kinds of votes:     Ownership votes , which control most functionality within the protocol. These votes require a 30% quorum with 51% support.   Parameter votes , which can modify pool parameters. These votes require a 15% quorum with 60% support.   Emergency votes , which are executed through a multisig consisting of nine members, comprised of reputable figures within the DeFi and Crypto community. More here:  Emergency DAO .       Voting Quorum   Intuitively, one might think that the total number of votes ( YES  and  NO ) would count towards the quorum. However, this is not the case here. Only  YES  votes are counted towards the quorum.   This can lead to scenarios like this:  https://twitter.com/WormholeOracle/status/1782646259536531808       Emergency DAO    The EmergencyDAO is a  5 of 9 multisig  which has  very limited actions . It  may kill non-factory pools  up to 2 months old. Pools that have been killed will only allow users to  remove_liquidity . It may also  kill liquidity gauges  at any time, setting its rate of CRV emissions to 0 and therefore not allowing any further CRV emission to the pool.

To address this, Curve has deployed various contracts on those chains to ensure DAO control. Even for cross-chain votes,  voting always takes place on the Ethereum Mainnet . Once the vote concludes, the final  outcome is transmitted via a message to the corresponding chain , where it is then executed.     DAO Control Across Chains   While DAO control of Curve smart contracts is ensured on most chains, some chains might not yet offer the required infrastructure to support this cross-chain framework. A list of all cross-chain ownership-related contracts, as well as more technical documentation, can be found  here .       The DAO Dashboard    Users can access the Curve DAO dashboard at  https://dao.curve.fi/dao . This dashboard provides an overview of all current and closed votes. Each proposal should have a corresponding topic on the Curve governance forum, accessible at  https://gov.curve.fi/ .     Creating Proposals    To create an official proposal, users should first draft the proposal and post it on the governance forum. Its important to evaluate the proposals feasibility and gauge community interest through the Curve Discord, Telegram, or Governance forum.   If users are unsure about the technical aspects of submitting the proposal to the Ethereum blockchain, they can seek assistance from a member of the team.

Home             Governance              Voting   How to participate in governance?    To participate in governance, Curve Finance users need to  lock  their CRV into a voting escrow.   You can do so at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/locker    What are veCRV?    veCRV stands for voting escrow CRV. They are your CRV locked for voting. The longer you lock your CRV for, the more voting power you have (and the bigger boost you can reach). You can vote lock 1,000 CRV for a year to have a 250 veCRV weight.   Your veCRV weight gradually decreases as your escrowed tokens approach their lock expiry. A graph illustrating the decrease can be found at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/locker    Get more voting power by locking your CRV for a longer period of time.   Can I start voting right away?    You can only vote using your voting weight at the block where a proposal was created.   How to vote?    Simply visit the proposal of your choice, click your vote option and confirm your transaction.

There are currently two types of votes: parameter and text.   Parameter votes are automatically committed to the DAO three days after they are enacted at the end of the vote. Text proposals are different as they often necessitate development. For these, it is recommended to discuss with the Curve team to understand the feasibility and to create a signaling proposal.   Before creating an on-chain vote, it might make sense to do a temperature check on the  governance forum , especially if the subject is of an important matter.   To actually create an on-chain proposal, 2500 veCRV are required. (1)     But there's nothing to worry about, my friend. If you don't have 2500 veCRV, there are plenty of helpful community members who will surely help you create one.     Creating your vote    Visit the Curve DAO:  https://dao.curve.fi/dao , select your type of vote and submit it.     Creating your proposal    Every DAO proposal must be accompanied with a proposal on the Curve governance forum. Visit the proposal section:  https://gov.curve.fi/c/proposals/8  and click  \"New Topic\" .

Pools with unmanipulatable oracles are the following:     twocrypto-ng  - for 2 unpegged assets, e.g., crvUSD/CRV   tricrypto-ng  - for 3 unpegged assets, e.g., crvUSD/WETH/CRV   stableswap-ng  - for 2 pegged assets, e.g., crvUSD/USDC       Custom Price Oracles   If an ASSET/WETH pool is more desirable than an ASSET/crvUSD pool, it is possible to link the ASSET/WETH price to the WETH/crvUSD price using a custom price oracle. This can then be used to create a lending market. Please get in contact with the team in telegram if this is the case.     The easiest way to create a pool is through the official  Create Pool UI .   Guides are available for creating a  stableswap-ng pool ,  twocrypto-ng pool , and a  tricrypto-ng pool .     Creating a Lending Market    To create a lending market use the  create , or  create_from_pool  methods in the  OneWay Lending Factory  smart contract to deploy all relevant contracts and set all parameters. Find the  OneWay Lending Factory  addresses for different chains  here . There is no UI for this step, it has to be done through Etherscan, or manually.   To deploy a lending market using the  create_from_pool  method after deploying a pool the following unique parameter is used:     pool  : the address of the pool which includes both the  borrowed_token  and  collateral_token .     To deploy a lending market using the  create  method with a custom oracle the following unique parameter is used:     price_oracle  : address of the custom price oracle contract     Then for both methods the following additional parameters must be supplied:     borrowed_token  : address of the token to be supplied and borrowed   collateral_token  : address of the token to be used as collateral   A  : the amplification factor, most markets use a value between 10-30. Use lower values for riskier assets.  Input as a normal number, e.g., 10 = 10   fee  : the amm swap fee, most pools use between 0.3-1.5%.  Input as a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 0.06% = 6000000000000000.   loan_discount  : the amount to discount collateral for calculating maximum LTV. This is usually higher than  liquidation_discount  by 3-4%.  Input as a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 11% = 110000000000000000.   liquidation_discount  : the amount to discount collateral for health and hard-liquidation calculations. This is usually less than  loan_discount  by 3-4%.  Input as a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 8% = 80000000000000000.   name  : The name of the market     Finally, the following parameters are  optional  for both methods, if they are not supplied they are set to the default values set by the CurveDAO:     min_borrow_rate  : the minimum borrow rate, as rate/sec.  Input as a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 1% APR = 317097919   max_borrow_rate  : the maximum borrow rate, as rate/sec.  Input as a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 80% APR = 25367833587       Warning   Parameters are given in different formats:  A  is just given as itself, e.g., 30 = 30, but others like  loan_discount  are given as a a  \\(10^{18}\\)  number, e.g., 11% = 110000000000000000.     Using the  OneWay Lending Factory  will add the pool to the Curve UI and deploy all contracts needed for the market to function.     CRV Rewards and other Incentives for Suppliers    Deploying a Gauge    A  Curve lending market requires a gauge  linked to the supply vault  before suppliers can stake their  vault shares  to receive incentives/rewards . A gauge can be easily deployed through the  OneWay Lending Factory  by calling the  deploy_gauge  method and supplying the newly created  vault  contract address.  Anyone can deploy a gauge  for a market that does not have one.   Receiving CRV rewards from weekly emissions    Before a gauge is eligible to receive CRV from weekly emissions, it must be added to the  Gauge Controller  contract, the contract is deployed on Ethereum  here . To be added to the  Gauge Controller  the CurveDAO must vote to add the lending market's gauge. See  here  for how to create a vote to add a gauge to the  Gauge Controller .   Once a Curve lending market has a gauge added to the  Gauge Controller  and it receives some  gauge weight , the suppliers will receive CRV rewards when they stake their  vault shares  into the gauge.   Adding other incentives for suppliers    The deployer of the Curve Lending Market is given the role of  manager . The  manager  can add reward tokens to the pool through the  add_reward  method within the lending market's gauge. Once a token is added, the  manager  can deposit the token using the  deposit_reward_token  method. The tokens then stream to the suppliers staked in the gauge over the specified period.     Lending Market Deployment Parameters    Amplification Factor (A)    The amplification factor  A  defines the width of bands, see formula below and more detailed information  here  and applet  here .  A  is also a part of the calculation for the maximum LTV of the market, see  loan_discount  section .   \\[\\text{band_width} \\approx \\frac{\\text{price}}{\\text{A}}\\]   Loan Discount    The  loan_discount  is used for finding the maximum LTV (loan-to-value) a user can have in a lending market. At the time of writing this value ranges from 7% for WETH to 33% for volatile and less liquid assets like UwU. Use the calculator  here  to see the maximum LTVs a user can have based on the  loan_discount , amplification factor  A  and their number of bands  N . The formula is:   \\[\\text{max_LTV} = 1 - \\text{loan_discount} - \\frac{N}{2*A}\\]   Liquidation Discount    liquidation_discount  defines how much to discount the collateral for the purpose of a hard-liquidation. This is usually 3-4% lower than the  loan_discount . A user is hard-liquidated when their health is less than 0, and the  liquidation_discount  is an integral part of the health calculation. See  here  for more information   Borrowing Interest Rates    When creating a market the creator must define the  min_borrow_rate  and  max_borrow_rate  of the market. Use the tool below to simulate how  utilization  affects borrowing and lending interest rates. In the smart contracts the rates they are given as  interest per second , converting from a desired  APR  to a  borrow_rate  in interest per second is as follows:   \\[\\text{borrow_rate} = \\frac{\\text{APR}}{\\text{seconds_in_year}} = \\frac{\\text{APR}}{86400 \\times 365}\\]       Inputs:       Min Borrow APR % :     Max Borrow APR % :                              Back to top", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Curve Lending: FAQ", "html_url": "https://resources.curve.fi/lending/faq/", "body": "Curve Resources               CurveDocs/curve-resources               Home               Getting Started             Getting Started           Understanding Curve (v1)             Understanding CryptoPools (v2)                     CRV Token             CRV Token           Overview & Tokenomics             Supply & Distribution             CRV & veCRV FAQ                     Locked CRV (veCRV)             Locked CRV (veCRV)           Overview             How to Lock CRV             Claiming Trading Fees             Fee Collection & Distribution                     Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)             Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)           Understanding crvUSD             Loan Creation & Management             Loan Details & Concepts             Liquidations             Loan Strategies             crvUSD FAQ                     Curve Lending             Curve Lending           Overview             Leverage             Liquidations             How to Borrow & Use Leverage             How to Supply               Lending FAQ           Lending FAQ           Table of contents              General                    What's the difference between minting crvUSD and lending markets?

Home             Curve Lending              Curve Lending: FAQ   General    What's the difference between minting crvUSD and lending markets?    Lending markets work very similarly to the markets for minting crvUSD. Here are the major differences:     Lending markets are permissionless;  any assets in combination with crvUSD can be used . This means users can borrow against tokens like CRV, LRT's, etc. You name it. The only requirement is a  proper oracle 1 . Although, before creating a lending market, proper parameters should be simulated.   The  interest rate of lending markets solely depends on the utilization of the supplied assets , unlike for minting markets which depend on various factors such as crvUSD price, pegkeeper debt, and other parameters.     How much can you borrow against your collateral (LTV)?    The maximum borrowable amount (LTV) is dependent on the parameter  A  and number of bands ( N ) chosen when creating a market. The more bands used, the higher the LTV.   How does the LLAMMA liquidation process differ from other debt-based stablecoins?    crvUSD uses an innovative mechanism to reduce the risk of liquidations. Instead of instantly triggering a liquidation at a specific price, a users collateral is converted into stablecoins across a smooth range of prices.   Simulations suggest most price drops would result in the loss of just a few percentage points worth of collateral value, instead of the instant and total loss implemented by the liquidation process common to most debt-based stablecoins.   What tokens can be used in lending markets? How to create a lending market?    Curve lending is totally permissionless. Everyone can create markets. The only requirement is, that crvUSD is either the borrowable or collateral token. Although creating a market is totally permissionless, some important parameters need to be simulated ahead of deployment.   What is a 'loan discount' and what impact does it have?    A 'loan discount' is a percentage applied to reduce the value of collateral for determining the maximum borrowable amount. A higher loan discount results in a lower borrowing limit, acting as a safety margin for lenders against collateral value declines.    The maximum amount that can be borrowed is also influenced by other factors, such as market conditions and asset volatility. For more details on these factors and their impact on borrowing, see the technical documentation at  https://docs.curve.fi/crvUSD/amm/ .   What is the difference between self-liquidating and repaying?    You cannot self-liquidate a partial amount of a loan, self-liquidating closes the loan, but you can repay a partial amount, e.g., 20% of the debt, this increases the health of the loan. If the repayment takes you out of soft-liquidation, your bands may move.   When repaying and self-liquidating the whole loan, repaying and self liquidating work slightly differently, let's show this using a market lending crvUSD using WETH as collateral:     For self-liquidating, if some WETH has been converted to crvUSD during soft-liquidation, then the user must transfer the difference between the crvUSD held as collateral and the debt.   When repaying with crvUSD, you must transfer enough crvUSD to cover the debt, and you receive all the collateral in return. However in new markets (markets with leverage), it's possible to repay with collateral. In this case, the user does not need to send anything, all collateral is transferred to crvUSD, and the user receives back any crvUSD left after debt is repaid.       Liquidation Process    What is my liquidation price?    When creating a loan, collateral is deposited and equally distributed over a range of prices, not just a single liquidation price. Should the price fall within this range, the collateral begins its conversion into crvUSD. This process aids in maintaining the loan's health and, under most conditions, wards off liquidation. As a result, there isn't one specific liquidation price.   When depositing collateral, how do I adjust and select my collateral deposit price range?    The price range can be optionally adjusted and customized during the initial loan creation process. In the UI, the  \"Advanced Mode\"  toggle provides further insights into this range.    What happens when the collateral price drops into my selected range? (soft-liquidation)    Each lending market is linked to a LLAMMA, which is a special AMM. If the collateral price falls into the selected range, this collateral becomes tradable in the AMM. At this juncture, traders have the opportunity to acquire the collateral, substituting it with crvUSD. Consequently, the loan becomes collateralized by stablecoins, known for their more reliable value retention, contributing to the sustained health of the loan.   What happens if the collateral price recovers? (de-liquidation)    As the collateral price increases, the aforementioned process reverses. The position undergoes trading through the AMM, transitioning from crvUSD back to the original form of collateral. Owing to AMM trading fees, it's typical for a slight percentage of the original collateral value to be diminished once the collateral price surpasses the upper limit of the predetermined liquidation range.   Under what circumstances can I be liquidated? (hard-liquidation)    Should a loan's health drop below 0%, it becomes eligible for liquidation. In this scenario, the collateral is sold off, and the position closes. Although the crvUSD collateral conversion mechanism within the AMM is designed to protect against liquidations, it might not keep up with severe price fluctuations. It is advisable for borrowers to maintain their loan health, especially when prices fall within the selected liquidation range.   How do I maintain my loan health if collateral price drops into my range?    When the collateral price falls into the liquidation range, adding new collateral to protect loan health is not permitted. Within this liquidation range, loan health can only be improved by repaying debt. Even minimal debt repayments can be effective in preventing liquidation while the collateral price resides within this range.   What happens to the collateral in the event of hard liquidation?    In the event of a hard liquidation, all available collateral is sold off by the AMM system, the debt is covered, and the loan is closed.   What is a liquidation discount and how is the 'liquidation discount' calculated during a liquidation?    The 'liquidation discount' is calculated based on the collateral's market value and is designed to incentivize liquidators to participate in the liquidation process. This factor is used to effectively discount the collateral valuation when calculating the health for liquidation purposes.   In other protocols, this may be referred to as a liquidation threshold and is often hard-coded instead of calculated dynamically.     Interest Rate    What is the borrow rate?    The borrow rate is the variable interest rate charged on the debt of the loan. The borrow rate is solely determined by the  utilization  of the market.   How is the borrow rate calculated?    For the calculation of the borrow rate, see  here .   What is the lend rate?    The lend rate is the variable interest rate a lender receives in exchange for lending out their assets to borrowers.   How is the lend rate calculated?    For the calculation of the lend rate, see  here .     Safety and Risks    What are the risks of using crvUSD    A risk disclaimer can be found  here   How can I best manage my risks when borrowing assets?    Best risk management practices include maintaining a safe collateralization ratio, understanding the potential for liquidation, and keeping an eye on market conditions.   Has the lending system been audited?    Yes. All public audits can be found  here .   Can I see the code?    The code is publicly available on the  Curve Github .           New Curve pools such as stableswap-ng, twocrypto-ng, or tricrypto-ng provide a suitable oracle.

The  leverage  column shows whether or not built-in leverage is available in the market.   Borrow APY  represents the current  borrow rate . The  Available  column shows the amount of assets left to borrow and  Borrowed  is the total amount currently borrowed.   Supplied  shows the total amount of the borrowable token which has been supplied by users. The  Utilization (%)  is the ratio of  Borrowed  to  Supplied  tokens, see  here  for more information.     Creating A New Loan    In order to create a loan and borrow tokens against collateral, a user first needs to choose a lending market. This can simply be done by clicking the desired market.   Having  \"Advanced Mode\"  activated when creating a loan allows the user to additionally select the number of bands for the loan and displays the corresponding liquidation range. If deactivated, the loan will be created with a default amount of 10 bands.       Advanced Mode can be toggled on the top right of the page.       Number of Bands (N)   A  higher number of bands results in fewer losses when the loan is in soft-liquidation  mode. The maximum number of bands is 50, while the minimum is 4.             Additionally, the UI shows the future borrow APY when the user's loan is created and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.     Advanced mode also enables an overview of the entire LLAMMA including important values such as lend or borrow APY, available amount to borrow, etc.           Down below, a section containing relevant contracts and the current parameters for the lending market is displayed.             Fee : The current exchange fee for swapping tokens in the AMM.   Admin Fee : The percentage of the total fee, which is awarded to veCRV holders. Currently, all fees go to liquidity providers in the AMM (which are the borrowers).   A : The amplification parameter A defines the density of liquidity and band size.   Loan Discount : The percentage used to discount the collateral for calculating the maximum borrowable amount when creating a loan.   Liquidation Discount : The percentage used to discount the collateral for calculating the recoverable value upon liquidation at the current market price.   Base Price : The base price is the price of the band number 0.   Oracle Price : The oracle price is the current price of the collateral as determined by the oracle. The oracle price is used to calculate the collateral's value and the loan's health.       Navigating to the  \"Your Details\"  tab displays all the user's loan details: 1             Loan Management      Loan Management when in soft-liquidation mode   During soft-liquidation, users are unable to add or withdraw collateral.  They can choose to  either partially or fully repay  their crvUSD debt to improve their health ratio  or  decide to  self-liquidate  their loan if their collateral composition contains sufficient crvUSD to cover the outstanding debt. If they opt for self-liquidation, the user's debt is fully repaid and the loan will be closed. Any residual amounts are then returned to the user.     Understanding how soft-liquidations, loan health and hard-liquidations work is essential for understanding how to manage loans on Curve. Be sure to read and understand the following sections before taking out a loan:     Understanding Soft-Liquidations   Understanding Loan Health & Hard-Liquidations     The rest of this section talks about how to use the UI to manage loans and collateral.   Collateral Tab    The  \"Collateral\"  tab allows the adjustment of collateral:           Add collateral    Add more collateral to the loan.  This is not possible while in soft-liquidation. If health is getting low, some debt must be repaid instead of adding more collateral .   Remove collateral    Remove collateral from the loan.   Manage Loan Tab    The  \"Manage Loan\"  tab has the following options:           Borrow More    Borrow more simply allows the user to borrow more debt and add more collateral at the same time.   Repay    Repay has the following options, and all options allow the user to  partially  or  fully repay  their loans. If only a partial repayment is done then the liquidation range will change for the user.     Repay From Collateral  will remove the collateral (e.g., WETH or crvUSD) out of the lending market, convert them all to the debt asset if required (e.g., crvUSD), and send any leftover debt asset (e.g., crvUSD) back to the user if the loan is fully paid and closed.  Note this is only available on new markets (markets which allow leverage allow this feature). For older markets it's required to repay with the debt token.   Repay from wallet  has two boxes, one for the collateral asset, and one for the debt asset:       Collateral asset, e.g., WETH : this works the same way as  Repay From Collateral , all sent WETH would be converted to crvUSD, debt would be repaid and any remaining crvUSD transferred back to the user if the loan is fully paid and closed.       Debt asset, e.g., crvUSD : this repays the debt with the sent crvUSD. If all debt is repaid the loan is closed and all collateral in the lending market is sent back to the user, in the above case the user would receive back their WETH.       Self-liquidate    This allows a user to liquidate themselves before they get hard-liquidated. Users using this feature will most likely already be in soft-liquidation. This lets the user retrieve their collateral and stops them from losing the amount defined by the  liquidation_discount .   Let's look at user called Alice who intially borrowed 1000 crvUSD using 1 WETH as collateral for how this works. Alice is in soft liquidation and her health is getting low. In soft liquidation 0.2 WETH has been converted to 250 crvUSD, so she now has 0.8 WETH and 250 crvUSD backing her 1000 crvUSD loan. Alice wants to self liquidate. Alice only needs to send 750 crvUSD to self-liquidate, because she already has 250 crvUSD of collateral, both these amounts together will pay off the 1000 crvUSD debt. Alice then receives back her 0.8 WETH.     How to take out a leverage loan    All new lending markets allow users to use leverage. E.g., the WBTC market below allows up to 11x leverage when borrowing from this lending market. 11x leverage means 10x the deposited amount of WBTC is borrowed as crvUSD and swapped to WBTC using 1inch.       Info   If the market does not display a value in the leverage column, then leverage can still be built up manually by  looping .     Click on the desired market with leverage, then navigate to the  leverage  tab next to the  create loan  tab shown here:     After navigating to the  leverage  tab, the following options will be displayed:     This shows all the information and options to open a leveraged loan. Notice that the  ADD FROM WALLET  allows both assets to be added to the loan. In this market a user could add WBTC, or crvUSD or both. See the information about  depositing a combination of assets  for how this works.   The  BORROW AMOUNT  lets the user specify how much they would like to borrow.   If  Advanced Mode  is enabled , then the user can click on the  adjust  button next to the liquidation range. This allows a user to change the number of bands  N  for their liquidation range. An example of this is shown below with the other loan details:     Leverage  is calculated using the following formula:   \\[ \\text{Leverage} = \\frac{\\text{value deposited} + \\text{value borrowed}}{\\text{value deposited}}\\]   For example if $10,000 crvUSD and $10,000 of WBTC is deposited ($20,000 value total deposited) and the user borrows $80,000 crvUSD, then leverage is 5x.   Expected  and  Expected avg. price  both relate in this case to how much WBTC is expected to be received after swapping the borrowed crvUSD, and what the expected average price for swapping is.  Expected  has collapsible details which shows the route the assets will be swapped through. These  swaps are always provided by 1inch . An example of these details are provided below and show that 125 crvUSD will be swapped to 0.0019074 WBTC.     Price impact  is the difference between the oracle price and the average swap price.   Band range  is the starting and finishing bands of liquidity for the loan, e.g., \"4 to 13\" means the loan will begin soft-liquidation in band 4, and finish in band 13.  Price range  shows the  Band range  but as a price range, e.g., band 4 to 13 could be a price range like 52,994 to 60,607. See  here  for more information about bands.   Health  is how healthy the loan is, this value must be positive, if it is less than or equal to 0 then the loan can be hard liquidated. See  here  for more information about health.   Borrow APY  shows the interest rate before and after the loan is created.  Loan to Value Ratio  shows the deposited collateral value compared to the borrowed collateral.   Estimated TX Cost  shows the gas cost in USD.  Slippage tolerance  is the maximum slippage allowed when swapping.   Before taking out a loan, a screen will appear showing the details of the loan, for example:      Then the tokens which will be used as collateral need to be approved and then the loan can be taken out by clicking the  Get Loan  and sending the transaction.   Closing a leveraged loan    Closing a leveraged loan can be done in 2 ways, either through  repaying , or  self-liquidating . The most efficient of these options is to  Repay with collateral . This removes all collateral, swaps it to the same token as the debt, repays the debt and transfers the rest back to the user. Otherwise the debt needs to be fully repaid to close the loan, and as this is a leveraged loan, the debt may be higher than the user's available assets, making this unviable.

Lend APY  is the current annualized rate for doing so.   Additionally, vaults can have gauges, which are eligible to receive CRV emissions once they are added to the GaugeController. These rewards will show up in the  Rewards APR / CRV + Incentives  column if there are any. See  here  for information about what's required to have CRV rewards.   TVL  displays the total value locked into the vault.     How do Supply Vaults work?    Liquidity for borrowers is provided in  ERC-4626 vaults . For detailed documentation on how they work, please check out the official  Ethereum documentation  or visit the  technical docs of Curve .   These vaults are  yield-bearing , meaning there is  no need for the user to claim  awarded rewards for lending out their assets 1 . The shares they receive for depositing assets into the vault  increase in value  because the balance of the underlying asset increases due to the dynamics of interest rates.     Depositing Assets    In order to supply tokens to the vault, the user must  specify the amount of underlying tokens to add . Underlying tokens are referred to as the asset in the vault, which is the asset that's borrowed.  When depositing, the UI previews the amount of shares to receive and projects the lend APY after the deposit. For depositing, there is no cap. Users can deposit as much as they want.             Staking Assets    After depositing, if desired, users can stake their vault shares into the corresponding gauge (if there is one) under the  \"Stake\"  tab. This allows the user to receive Rewards APR if there is any available. Click on the  Deposit  ->  Stake  tab to deposit your assets. By staking your supply vault shares you are sending them to the Rewards Gauge, you retain ownership, but they are nontransferable while staked. Staking requires a transaction.           Liquidity gauges of vaults can be added to the GaugeController in order to be eligible to receive CRV emissions or external rewards can be added to the gauge by the deployer.     Unstaking Assets    Unstaking withdraws your Vault Shares from the Rewards Gauge to your address. It requires a transaction to unstake. Unstaking and claiming rewards can be done together in a single transaction. It can be done from the  Withdraw  ->  Unstake  tab of the Supply UI for the lending market you've supplied to.           You must  Unstake  your Vault shares before being able to  Withdraw .     Withdrawing Assets    If a user already has some shares, they can withdraw a desired amount of the underlying asset under the  \"Withdraw\"  tab. There is also a \"Withdraw in full\" option, which burns all the user's shares and converts them into the underlying asset 2 .            The UI previews the amount of shares to be burned in order to receive the underlying tokens. If a user has staked the vault shares in a gauge, they are required to unstake them under the  \"Unstake\"  tab before being able to withdraw.     Lending Rates when Depositing or Withdrawing Assets   When depositing underlying assets into the vault, the lending rate may decrease depending on the amount of assets added. The reason for this is that when supplying additional assets, the market's Utilization Rate will decrease (as there are now more assets to borrow from), which simultaneously decreases the borrow rate. When the borrow rate decreases, the lending rate decreases as well.   Vice versa: Withdrawing assets from the vault reduces the total amount of assets. This drives the utilization rate up, which increases the borrow rate and therefore also the lending rate.    See  here  for more information about Utilization and how it affects lending and borrow rates       Claiming Rewards    Any rewards from a  Rewards APR  will be available under the  Withdraw  ->  Claim Rewards  tab here:           Claiming rewards requires a transaction, however unstaking and claiming together can be done in a single transaction.     Having  \"Advanced Mode\"  enabled adds a full overview of the vault.           If a user has shares, the user can view their personal vault information on the  \"Your Details\"  tab.                   This does not apply to rewards awarded from liquidity gauges. They need to be claimed under the  \"Withdraw\" -> \"Claim Rewards\"  tab.        This method will only work if the vault has enough underlying assets to fully redeem all the shares.

How Leverage Works    Leverage on Curve Lending allows a user to  multiply their gains (and losses) by the amount of leverage  they desire. For example, if a user is borrowing crvUSD with WETH collateral at 2x leverage, they will make twice as much profit in crvUSD compared to just holding their WETH without leverage (not accounting for borrowing rates). Let's look at a few quick examples:         ETH starting price   ETH end price   Deposited Collateral   Borrowed Collateral   Total Collateral   Leverage   Profit   ETH Profit           1000 crvUSD   2000 crvUSD   1 ETH   0 ETH   1 ETH   1x   1000 crvUSD   0       1000 crvUSD   2000 crvUSD   1 ETH   1 ETH   2 ETH   2x   2000 crvUSD   1 ETH       1000 crvUSD   2000 crvUSD   1 ETH   2 ETH   3 ETH   3x   3000 crvUSD   2 ETH           Warning   Multiplied profits from leverage also means multiplied loses when prices decrease.     Leverage Looping    Anyone can create their own leverage in any lending market, let's see how it can be done:       In the above example Alice can create her own leverage by simply continually depositing her WETH, borrowing crvUSD, swapping the borrowed crvUSD back to WETH, and then depositing the new WETH, and borrowing more crvUSD. This process can be repeated as much as desired, but each time the user will loop less and less as the loan LTV is always less than 100%.   If 1 WETH is worth 3,000 crvUSD and the user has borrowed 6,000 crvUSD then that is called 2x leverage.   Built-in Leverage    Some Curve Lending markets allow leverage without doing the looping strategy mentioned above. This built-in leverage allows the user to achieve their desired leverage using a single transaction. Only some lending markets have this functionality, below is a image of the lending UI which shows the WBTC market. This market allows a leverage of up to 11x.      Built-in leverage works and can be used in the following way:     Depositing a combination of assets    Instead of depositing only WETH, Curve Lending also lets Alice deposit crvUSD and WETH together. If Alice chooses to do this, then any crvUSD she deposits will be added to the borrowed crvUSD and converted to WETH through 1inch before it's all deposited into the lending market, let's look at that quickly below.     Note: as Alice's total collateral is still worth 3,000 crvUSD (1,500 crvUSD + 0.5 WETH), with 5x leverage she still borrows 12,000 crvUSD (4x her deposited collateral). Also, the repayments transaction and profit made in this instance work exactly the same as shown in the other image above as all the collateral is converted to WETH even though she deposited WETH and crvUSD together.

collateral token or to borrow any token against crvUSD, while benefiting from the  soft-liquidation mechanism  provided by  LLAMMA . This innovative approach to overcollateralized loans enhances risk management and user experience for borrowers. Additionally, Curve Lending allows users to  generate interest through lending (supplying) their assets  to be borrowed by others.     Collateral in Lending Markets  DO NOT  back crvUSD   The collateral used in Curve Lending markets does not back crvUSD.  All crvUSD within Curve Lending is supplied by users . Conversely, minting new crvUSD requires high-quality crypto collateral approved by the DAO. The  crvUSD minting system is separate from the lending markets .  See here for more differences between Curve Lending and minting crvUSD .       Curve Lending Risk Disclaimer   Full risk disclaimer on using Curve Lending can be found  here             Borrowers     Borrowers are the ones  borrowing assets . To do so, they create a loan and put up some collateral. In exchange for borrowing, they pay a certain  Borrow Interest Rate (Borrow APY) .      How to Borrow         Lenders     Lenders  supply their assets so they can be loaned to borrowers . To do so, they deposit their assets into a  Vault . In exchange for supplying their assets, they are awarded a  Lending Interest Rate .      How to Supply (Lend)           Overview    Let's take a look at a single market to see the basics of how it works:       Let's breakdown the different entities and their roles in this market:         Entity     Role             Business Llama   Business Llama represents the lending market and smart contracts in the system. This llama uses CRV as collateral, and lends out crvUSD. Business Llama  charges interest on crvUSD users borrow (Borrow APY) , and  pays interest to lenders who supply crvUSD (Lend APY) .         Bob   Bob always thinks the market will crash, so he  supplies his crvUSD  and Business Llama  lends it out and pays Bob interest (Lend APY) .         Alice   Alice wants to go trade meme coins but doesn't want to sell her CRV, so she  deposits CRV and uses it as collateral to borrow crvUSD . She feels safe knowing she's better protected here with LLAMMA and soft-liquidations than other lending markets. She is  charged the Borrow APY on her debt  while the loan is open.           Charlie  &  Daisy   Charlie and Daisy are just talking to the wrong Business Llama (lending market). All Curve Lending Markets are one-way, and isolated. They need to go and find the Business Llama that lends out CRV with crvUSD collateral. (Business llama with the red background  here )           Markets    There are many Curve Lending markets listed on the  main UI . Each market uses a single type of collateral, and make loans in a single asset ( all markets are one-way , and  all markets are isolated ). Some of the markets available are pictured below (we've used llamas in suits to illustrate different markets), but there are many more available, and  new markets can be permissionlessly deployed  by anyone, at anytime (as long as the asset has a suitable  price oracle ).      Note: All markets are paired with crvUSD. crvUSD must be either the collateral or the coin being borrowed.     Supplying (Lending)    Earning interest for supplying assets to Curve Lending is simple.   Let's have a look at an example where Bob lends his crvUSD for a year and how much he earns:       So after 1 year  Bob earned 20 crvUSD  and  $20 worth of CRV , this equates to an  APR of 40%  over that year.     Depositing and Withdrawing    After depositing to a lending market your assets are added to the pool of  available supply .   You can withdraw a supplied asset provided there are sufficient available (un-borrowed) assets in the market. For example in the below image Bob could have withdrawn up to 1200 crvUSD from the market, but he only withdrew 300 crvUSD.        If there are insufficient available assets for a full withdrawal, you can withdraw the maximum amount currently available. The high utilization rate will cause Borrow APY and Lend APYs to increase, incentivizing borrowers to repay their loans, and more lenders to supply. As available supply increases you can withdraw your remaining balance over time.     Bad Debt   Bad debt  is rare, but if it exists within a lending market, it  may be impossible to withdraw supplied assets , as it locks supplied assets as \"borrowed\" indefinitely. It is recommended not to supply assets to markets with large amounts of bad debt. Use  this notebook  or see the code on  github here  to find which markets have bad debt.    At the time of writing (May, 2024) no bad debt exists on Ethereum markets. On Arbitrum, two markets have bad debt - CRV/crvUSD: 1700 crvUSD bad debt, FXN/crvUSD: 39,000 crvUSD bad debt.       Supply Vault Share Tokens    By Supplying assets on Curve Lending, you are given  Supply Vault Shares  ( more info here ). These are tokens representing your  share of the total supply . The  value of these shares increases by Lend APY .   When you withdraw your supplied assets, the Vault Shares you had previously deposited are returned to the Lending Market. At this point, you receive the current value of the Vault Shares you are returning. This is how your interest on the supplied assets accrues.  By withdrawing your assets, you effectively claim the interest that has been earned  on your initial deposit during the time it was being lent out in the market.     Rewards APR    Rewards APR is a combination of CRV emission rewards and any other incentives provided to suppliers.  Rewards accrue altogether and can be claimed at any time.     Rewards APR is  ONLY  given to Suppliers  STAKED  in the Liquidity Gauge   You  MUST  stake your Supply Vault Shares in the Lending Market's Liquidity Gauge to receive Reward APR.   You will not get any Rewards APR if you   DO NOT   stake . See  here     For a market to have CRV rewards the following conditions must be met:     The Curve DAO must vote to add a  Liquidity Gauge  to the  GaugeController  for that specific lending market   The liquidity gauge must receive a positive  gauge weight  through votes from veCRV holders. This will result in CRV being emitted to the liquidity gauge.     Due to the boosting mechanism of liquidity gauges, the Reward APR will be displayed as a range based on the user's boost factor. Learn more about boosting  here .   Other incentives can be added by anyone, i.e., if a project wants to incentivize their token being used as collateral they may add incentives to a Lending Market. See  here  for more details and how to add them.     Borrowing    When borrowing from Curve Lending Markets, you are taking an  overcollateralized loan  against deposited assets (e.g., borrowing crvUSD with CRV collateral). In exchange, you are  charged the Borrow APY on the borrowed assets .   Collateral is deposited into each lending market's  LLAMMA  system and split evenly across the chosen number of bands (N).  Each band represents a small liquidation price range, with an upper and lower limit. If the oracle price enters one of your bands,  soft-liquidation begins .  Your loan is safe while the oracle price is higher than any of your bands .    See the image below for a breakdown of how supplied assets are borrowed, and how collateral is deposited into bands.       By  minimizing the number of bands  (N=4), you can  maximize the amount you borrow  (LTV), just like Charlie. Alice, however, prefers spreading his liquidity, so he chooses 10 bands (N=10) and does not maximize his borrowing. This explains why Charlie's loan is split into bands 3-12, while Alice's is split into bands 1-4. When you borrow, you can choose to split your collateral into  any number of bands from 4 to 50 .   There is no set rule for  whether fewer or more bands are better . Different numbers of bands are better in different scenarios:     More bands  equate to having fewer losses in soft-liquidation, but this also widens your Liquidation Range, potentially extending the duration of soft-liquidation.   Fewer bands  will narrow your Liquidation Range, causing your collateral to be traded more aggressively, but you may remain in the Liquidation Range for a shorter time.       Soft-liquidation    Soft-liquidation is a mechanism that gradually exchanges collateral (e.g., WETH) for the borrowed asset (e.g., crvUSD) as the collateral's value declines, avoiding the need for a single large liquidation. It also reverses this process if the collateral's value rises. The system sells collateral at a small discount, which increases with market volatility. Users undergoing soft-liquidation experience minor losses over time (in crvUSD minting markets typical losses are <0.1% per day), though this can vary based on loan and market conditions.   Soft-liquidation begins if the oracle price of your collateral falls into one of your bands. At this point, your collateral will be linearly traded for your borrowed asset as the price continues to drop through each band.   Let's examine what soft-liquidation looks like in a simplified example with a  single band  in an  ETH/crvUSD LLAMMA market . This example illustrates that if the price declines by 20% within the band, 20% of the ETH is converted to crvUSD. When the price is below the lower bound of the band (<$990), all the collateral is converted to crvUSD (100% crvUSD, 0% ETH). Conversely, when the price exceeds the upper bound (>$1000), all collateral remains as ETH (100% ETH, 0% crvUSD).       The below image represents  multiple bands  through soft-liquidation. Note the higher bands than the current price are fully converted to crvUSD and the lower bands are still ETH.       The value of traded assets remains as loan collateral throughout soft-liquidation. For example, if ETH is swapped for crvUSD, the value of that crvUSD is added to the collateral backing the loan. Additionally,  LLAMMA works both ways; if prices increase through your bands, any swapped collateral will be traded back for your initial collateral  (e.g., ETH swapped to crvUSD as the price decreased will be swapped back to ETH as the price increases).   Rebalancing collateral through soft-liquidation is incentivized for arbitrage traders by offering a small discount (when required) to buy or sell through LLAMMA. Trading back and forth your collateral is the reason why your  health factor erodes over time during soft-liquidation . Higher volatility generally leads to greater losses. However, your losses are partly recouped by the earned trading fees for providing liquidity.     Collateral  CANNOT  be deposited while in soft-liquidation   Collateral  cannot  be deposited during soft-liquidation.  Only debt repayment is allowed .       Health & Hard-Liquidation    Loan Health  is a measure of debt to collateral value. As long as health is positive, the position remains open. The health of a loan decreases due to losses in soft-liquidation and when debt increases due to interest paid.   Soft-liquidation  losses do not only occur when prices go down but also when the collateral price rises again . This implies that the health of a loan can decrease even though the collateral value of the position increases.   A loan becomes eligible for  hard-liquidation when its health drops below 0 . In this process, an external party can repay the user's debt and claim their collateral in return, closing the loan.  Going below the soft-liquidation range does not trigger a hard-liquidation . The key trigger is the health falling below 0.   It's possible for a loan to be below the soft-liquidation range, and have all its collateral converted to the borrowed asset (e.g., all CRV to crvUSD) while still maintaining a positive health . In this scenario, further price drops don't impact the position, as the converted collateral covers both the debt and safety buffer.   In contrast, most other lending platforms will hard-liquidate your collateral and terminate your loan if your loan falls below a minimum collateral ratio (LTV), even if only by a small amount for a brief time. This can be highly stressful for borrowers and lead to significant losses. Curve Lending offers a safer space and more peace of mind for borrowers.     Leverage    All new lending markets allow leverage. This allows users to multiply their gains (and losses) by the amount of leverage they desire. In a WETH/crvUSD market for example, this would allow the user to borrow up to 9x the amount of collateral they deposit. The caveat is that the user doesn't receive the borrowed crvUSD into their wallet, it is swapped for more WETH through 1inch and deposited into the lending market. To see how leverage works please see the dedicated  leverage page .     Utilization, Lend APY and Borrow APY    The  Lend APY  and  Borrow APY  are affected by the  Utilization  of the market. It is the ratio of assets supplied, to assets borrowed. In the image below the Utilization is 80% as 80% of the Supply is borrowed.  Higher Utilization means a higher Lending APY and Borrowing APY .       Utilization Rate    The formula for Utilization is the following:   \\[\\text{Utilization} = \\frac{\\text{Total assets borrowed}}{\\text{Total assets supplied}}\\]   Borrow Rate    The borrow APR is the rate a  borrower pays for borrowing out assets . In the  Curve UI this is quoted as an APY not an APR , see the info box below for the conversion formula and difference.   Borrowing rates are calculated differently based on whether the collateral asset has a crvUSD minting market.   Borrow Rate for assets with a crvUSD Minting Market    Assets with minting markets currently are: ETH (=WETH in lending markets), WBTC, wstETH, sfrxETH, tBTC. For these assets, the borrowing rates on Curve Lend depend on two factors: the borrow rate for minting crvUSD and the utilization of the lending pool. The technical documentation shows the  borrowing rate formula here . To decide whether to mint crvUSD or borrow from the lending market, consider the following:     Lending market  utilization below 85%  -> Borrowing rate will be lower on the  Lending Market   Lending market  utilization above 85%  -> Borrowing rate will be lower on the  crvUSD Minting Market   Lending market  utilization equals 85%  -> Borrowing rates will be equal     Borrow Rate for all other Assets    The formula for the borrow rate if the collateral asset does not have a minting market (e.g., CRV, pufETH, sUSDe, etc) is as follows:   \\[\\text{rate} = \\text{rate}_{\\text{min}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{rate}_{\\text{max}}}{\\text{rate}_{\\text{min}}}\\right)^{\\text{utilization}}\\]   \\[\\text{borrowAPR} = \\text{rate} \\cdot (365 \\cdot 86400)\\]   \\(\\text{rate}_{\\text{min}}\\)  and  \\(\\text{rate}_{\\text{max}}\\)  values are obtained from the monetary policy contract of each Lending Market and are given in interest per second. We multiply the rate by  \\(365 \\cdot 86400\\)  to get the APR because this is the amount of seconds in a year ( \\(365\\)  days  \\(\\times 86400\\)  seconds in a day).   Lend Rate    Lend APR is the  yield a lender receives in exchange for lending out their assets . The lend APR is calculated the same way for all lending markets.   Formula to calculate the Lend APR:   \\[\\text{lendAPR} = \\text{borrowAPR} \\cdot \\text{utilization}\\]     Difference between  APR  and  APY     APR  represents the Annual Percentage Rate ( interest without compounding )   APY  is the Annual Percentage Yield ( interest with compounding )     To convert the APR into APY, we need to annualize it and compound it every second (86400 seconds in a day):   \\[\\text{APY} = \\left(1 + \\frac{APR}{86400 \\cdot 365}\\right)^{86400 \\cdot 365} - 1\\]     For the current  CRV Lending Market  the Borrow APR and Lend APR for different Utilization rates is the following:           More Information    For information relating to opening loans see the  loan creation page   For information relating to how to supply assets see  supplying assets page   For Frequently Asked Questions about Curve Lending see the  FAQ here   For more technical information especially relating to the underlying smart contracts please see the  Lending section within the Curve Docs                Back to top", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Calculating yield", "html_url": "https://resources.curve.fi/lp/calculating-yield/", "body": "Curve Resources               CurveDocs/curve-resources               Home               Getting Started             Getting Started           Understanding Curve (v1)             Understanding CryptoPools (v2)                     CRV Token             CRV Token           Overview & Tokenomics             Supply & Distribution             CRV & veCRV FAQ                     Locked CRV (veCRV)             Locked CRV (veCRV)           Overview             How to Lock CRV             Claiming Trading Fees             Fee Collection & Distribution                     Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)             Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)           Understanding crvUSD             Loan Creation & Management             Loan Details & Concepts             Liquidations             Loan Strategies             crvUSD FAQ                     Curve Lending             Curve Lending           Overview             Leverage             Liquidations             How to Borrow & Use Leverage             How to Supply             Lending FAQ             How to Create a Lending Market                     Pools             Pools           Overview             Deposit FAQ               Calculating yield           Calculating yield           Table of contents              Types of Yield                     Base vAPY                   CRV Rewards tAPR                   Incentives tAPR                            Charts and Pool Activity               Depositing             Depositing           Overview             Depositing into the tri-pool             Depositing into a metapool             Depositing into the susd-pool             Depositing into a cryptoswap-pool             Depositing into a tricrypto-pool                           Pool Creation             Pool Creation           Pool Creation Overview             Creating a Stableswap NG Pool             Creating a Twocrypto NG Pool             Creating a Tricrypto NG Pool             Understanding oracles                     Liquidity Gauges             Liquidity Gauges           Understanding gauges             Creating a pool gauge             Boosting your CRV rewards             Gauge weights             Permissionless rewards                     Governance             Governance           Understanding Governance             Voting             Community Fund               Proposals             Proposals           Creating a DAO proposal                           Multi-Chain             Multi-Chain           CRV             crvUSD             Understanding multi-chain             Bridging funds             How to Bridge crvUSD to BSC                     Support & Troubleshooting             Support & Troubleshooting           Support             Recovering cross-asset swaps             Dropping and replacing a stuck transaction             Disabling crypto wallets in brave                     Risks, Security & Audits             Risks, Security & Audits             Risks             Risks           Liquidity Pools             crvUSD             Lending                   Security & Audits                     Whitepapers             Whitepapers           Curve Stableswap (2019)             Curve DAO (2020)             Curve Cryptopools (2021)             Curve Stablecoin (2022)                     Links             Links           Curve.fi             Curve DAO             Curve News             Discord             Github             Governance Forum             Twitter             Technical Docs             Telegram                   Glossary             Branding & Icons                             Table of contents              Types of Yield                     Base vAPY                   CRV Rewards tAPR                   Incentives tAPR                                      Home             Pools              Calculating yield   Explanation of how the Curve UI displays yield calculations     Warning   This page is outdated and will be updated soon.  Much of this information has changed. If you need up to date information please check the  new Technical Documentation  or ask in the  Curve Telegram . There are some links here to the  old Technical Documentation , documentation there is also outdated.     Like all documentation within this guide, this article is intended to be detailed but non-technical, outside of a few light mathematical formulas. While we highlight specific smart contract function names that the Curve UI may reference for convenience, no knowledge of coding is otherwise necessary to understand this article.   Types of Yield      Curve UI displaying different types of displayed Curve yield (tAPY and tAPR).   In the above screenshot you can see a Curve pool has the potential to offer many different types of yield. The documentation provides an overview of the different types of yield here:   Understanding CRV   Its important to remember that these numbers are a projections of historical pool performance. The user would get this rate if the pool performance stays exactly the same for one year.   These yield types are:     Base vAPY:  Shown on the first line, this number represents the fees that accrue to holders of the LP token based on trading volume.  More Info    $CRV Rewards tAPR:  Shown on the second line, the rewards tAPR represents the rate of $CRV token emissions one would have earned if the pool has a rewards gauge and the user stakes into this rewards gauge. The number is listed as a range of possible rewards, based on the users locked veCRV the size of this boost can vary.  More Info    Incentives Rewards tAPR:  Some pools also choose to stream rewards in the form of a different token  this is represented on the third line if applicable.     vAPY  stands for  variable annual percentage yield , this value calculates an annualized estimate of the trading fee yield based on the past days trading activity, inclusive of any effect of compounding.   The rewards  tAPR  stands for  token annual percentage rate   token rewards must be claimed manually and therefore do not automatically compound, so rate is the more proper term.   Base vAPY    When Curve pools are launched, they receive a value for both the  fee  (the overall fee applied to trades) and the  admin_fee  (the percentage of this fee that goes to the Curve DAO as opposed to pool LPs). These parameters are directly viewable on the smart contract through the corresponding function names.   These fees are displayed on the Curve UI pool page:     These parameters may also be updated in the future by the Curve DAO by calling the  commit_new_fee  method. If the fees are in the process of being changed, these are readable in the smart contract via the  future_fee  and  future_admin_fee  methods.   The fees are specifically earned or charged every time a user interacts with a pool contract through a transaction which may affect the pool balances. For example, directly calling the  exchange  function would rebalance the pool, so a fee clearly applies. If you add or remove liquidity in an imbalanced fashion, this would also adjust the ratios of tokens within the pool and thus be subject to fees. No fees are charged if a user adds coin in a balanced proportion or on removal.   When you call methods to preview how many tokens you might receive for interacting with a pool (ie  get_dy  or  calc_token_amount ) the values they return are usually but not always inclusive of any fees  the UI calculations are intended to make any corrections where appropriate, but be sure to ask the support team if you have questions.   Theoretically, one could calculate the base vAPY for any period by calculating the fees for every transaction and summing over the entire range. However, the Curve UI utilizes a simpler methodology to calculate the base vAPY, where  t  is the time in days:   \\[\\left( \\frac{\\text{virtual_price}(t=0)}{\\text{virtual_price}(t=-1)} \\right)^{365} - 1\\]   In other words, the vAPY measures the change in the pools  \"virtual price\"  between today and yesterday, then annualizes this rate. The  \"virtual price\"  is a measure of the pool growth over time, and is viewable directly on the UI.     The UI receives this value directly by calling the  get_virtual_price  method on the pool contract.   Every time a transaction occurs that charges a fee, the virtual price is incremented accordingly. Thus, when a pool launches with a virtual price of exactly 1, if the pools virtual price is 1.01 at some future time, an LP holding a token has seen the tokens value increase by 1%.   \\[\\frac{1.01}{1.00} - 1 = 0.01 = 1\\%\\]   A virtual price of 1.01 means an LP will get 1% more value back on removing liquidity. Similarly, new users adding liquidity will receive 1% fewer LP tokens on deposit.   For pegged stablecoin pools, virtual price can easily be utilized to calculate vAPY of the pool since inception with no further calculations necessary. For v2 pools, one must also consider the fluctuating prices of underlying assets.   For developers, here are more details about trade fees from the technical documentation:      About Trade Fees     Claiming Admin Fees     Fee Distribution      CRV Rewards tAPR    The Curve DAO also authorizes some pools to receive bonus rewards from $CRV token emission, as described in the  Understanding Gauges  section of the documentation. If the pool has an eligible gauge, then the UI displays the range of possible tAPR values users are earning at present, subject to change in the future.   The formula used here to calculate rewards tAPR:   \\[tAPR = \\frac{\\text{crv_price} \\times \\text{inflation_rate} \\times \\text{relative_weight} \\times 12614400}{\\text{working_supply} \\times \\text{asset_price} \\times \\text{virtual_price}}\\]   These parameters are obtained from various data sources, mostly on-chain:     crv_price:  The current price of the $CRV token in USD. This could be extrapolated from on-chain data, but the UI relies on the CoinGecko API to fetch this value.   inflation_rate:  The inflation rate of the $CRV token, accessed from the  rate  function of the $CRV token.   relative_weight:  Based on weekly voting, each Curve pool rewards gauge has a weighting relative to all other Curve gauges. This value can be calculated by calling the same function on the Curve  gauge controller contract .        https://dao.curve.fi/      working_supply:  Accessed by calling the same function on the specific Curve gauge contract for the pool.   asset_price:  The price of the asset  that is, if the pool contains only bitcoin, you would use the current price of $BTC. For v2 pools, this must be calculated by averaging over the specific assets within the pool.   virtual_price:  The measure of the pool growth over time, as described above.     The magic number  12614400  is number of seconds in a year  (60 * 60 * 24 * 365 = 31536000)  times 0.4. In this case the 0.4 is due to the effect of boosts (minimum boost of 1 / maximum boost of 2.5 = 0.4).   As shown in the UI, all tAPR values are displayed as a range, with the base rate on the left of the arrow representing the default rate one would receive if the user has no boost, and the value on the right of the arrow representing the maximum value a user could receive if the user has the maximum boost, which is 2.5 times higher than the minimum boost. Further details about calculating boosts  are provided here .

The UI displays these bonus rewards only when applicable. In the example of stETH below, note how the pool is streaming $LDO tokens in addition to $CRV rewards.

Charts    LP tokens are tokens received upon depositing assets into a liquidity pool. These tokens represent the holder's share of the pool and can be redeemed for a portion of the funds, plus any fees accrued over time. Similar to other tokens, their value is contingent on the prices of the underlying assets in the liquidity pool.   Navigating to the  Chart  tab reveals a graphical interface of the LP Token price in relation to, for example, USDT. In the top right corner, options are available to expand/minimize or refresh the chart, as well as to adjust its timeframe.             Clicking on  LP Token Price (USDT)  reveals a drop-down menu with additional charts.             Pool Activity    Besides a chart for prices, the UI also provides an overview of swaps and liquidity actions for the pool under the  Pool Activity  tab.    On the  Swaps  tab, the interface shows the tokens swapped and the time of each transaction, indicating how many hours or minutes ago it occurred. Clicking on a specific swap will redirect the user to the transaction on Etherscan.

Home             Pools              Deposit FAQ   What is the deposit wrapped option?    (This applies to metapools or pools with c-tokens or a-tokens). If you deposit a stablecoin to one of the pools with lending, Curve will automatically wrap your token to a cToken (for Compound) or aToken (for AAVE). The option is simply there if you have already previously lent them on Compound or AAVE. If your stablecoin is in its original form, you can ignore this option. If you deposit into metapools and you have the corresponding basepool token (for example, 3Crv), you can also use the \"deposit wrapped\" option to deposit this token.             What happens when you provide liquidity on Curve?    When you go to the deposit page and deposit one stablecoin, it then gets split between each token in the pool. Thats something you have to keep in mind because if you were to deposit 1000 DAI in the Pool, as per the screenshot below, your balance would be roughly equal to 390.7 GUSD, 120 DAI, 119.8 USDC and 362.6 USDT. Those values change constantly as people trade and arb the price of stable coins.             Does the coin I deposit matter?    Besides the deposit bonus explained below, it doesnt matter. Your tokens will get split into the pool and it doesnt affect your returns so you can deposit one, some or all the coins into the pool without worrying about it affecting your returns.   Understanding deposit bonuses    On the screenshot above, you can see GUSD is quite low as it should make up 50% of the total pool because it's a metapool paired against 3crv. So if your plan was to join the gusd-pool, you would ideally deposit GUSD into it.   As you can see on the screenshot, you would get an instant 0.0082% bonus for depositing GUSD into the pool.   The main reason for this is that GUSD is currently slightly more expensive so if you went to a centralized exchange you might sell it for $1.007 instead of $1. The deposit bonus reflects that.   The other reason behind this is that the pools are always trying to balance themselves and go back to equal parts (in this case 50% GUSD) so depositing the coin with the lowest share will get you a deposit bonus.             But does that mean I can still withdraw in my favorite stable coin?    When you withdraw, the same principle as in the question above applies- but reversed. If you withdraw the stable coin with the biggest share, you would get a bonus but you still choose what stable coin you want to withdraw.   How quickly does interest accrue/compound?    Interests for pools using lending protocols compound every block or 15 seconds or immediately after fees are paid. Its also compounded automatically.   What is arbitrage?    Arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of, in our case, a token to make a profit. Because cryptocurrency markets can often lack liquidity, there are often opportunities for traders to take advantage of price discrepancies to make a profit which can be helped by protocols like Curve.   An example transaction:  Etherscan    In this transaction, someone used Curve and OasisDex and made around $200. This goes back to what was discussed earlier with liquidity pools. The idea is that is you incentivize traders to take advantage of price discrepancies which we all get rewarded for.   What are incentivized pools?    Liquidity pools (particularly one without an opportunity cost) are a great way to help stable coins keep their pegs. It makes easy for traders to arb (see question above) when the price slips off the peg which is very important for all the companies and foundations developing stable coins as having a $0.98 stablecoin is never a good look.   As a result, some pools on Curve are incentivized. That means that on top of trading fees and lending fees, the companies will give rewards to people providing liquidity to the pools with their coins.     What makes the incentives APR move?    The steth pool in this screenshot earns another 2.69% of LDO per year and there are three variables that can make this change:     The LDO distributed is based on the number of people staking their LP tokens, which means your share of rewards gets lower if more people start staking   The price of LDO (price of LDO going up would make the yearly bonus go up)   The size of weekly rewards (48,000 SNX as of today) could also be lowered as Lido reevaluates its partnership with Curve                  Back to top", "labels": ["Documentation"]}, {"title": "Pools Overview", "html_url": "https://resources.curve.fi/lp/overview/", "body": "Curve Resources               CurveDocs/curve-resources               Home               Getting Started             Getting Started           Understanding Curve (v1)             Understanding CryptoPools (v2)                     CRV Token             CRV Token           Overview & Tokenomics             Supply & Distribution             CRV & veCRV FAQ                     Locked CRV (veCRV)             Locked CRV (veCRV)           Overview             How to Lock CRV             Claiming Trading Fees             Fee Collection & Distribution                     Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)             Curve Stablecoin (crvUSD)           Understanding crvUSD             Loan Creation & Management             Loan Details & Concepts             Liquidations             Loan Strategies             crvUSD FAQ                     Curve Lending             Curve Lending           Overview             Leverage             Liquidations             How to Borrow & Use Leverage             How to Supply             Lending FAQ             How to Create a Lending Market                     Pools             Pools             Overview           Overview           Table of contents              Stableswap  ( Curve V1 )                  Cryptoswap  ( Curve V2 )                  Pool Fees                   Rewards & Yield                      Deposit FAQ             Calculating yield             Charts and Pool Activity               Depositing             Depositing           Overview             Depositing into the tri-pool             Depositing into a metapool             Depositing into the susd-pool             Depositing into a cryptoswap-pool             Depositing into a tricrypto-pool                           Pool Creation             Pool Creation           Pool Creation Overview             Creating a Stableswap NG Pool             Creating a Twocrypto NG Pool             Creating a Tricrypto NG Pool             Understanding oracles                     Liquidity Gauges             Liquidity Gauges           Understanding gauges             Creating a pool gauge             Boosting your CRV rewards             Gauge weights             Permissionless rewards                     Governance             Governance           Understanding Governance             Voting             Community Fund               Proposals             Proposals           Creating a DAO proposal                           Multi-Chain             Multi-Chain           CRV             crvUSD             Understanding multi-chain             Bridging funds             How to Bridge crvUSD to BSC                     Support & Troubleshooting             Support & Troubleshooting           Support             Recovering cross-asset swaps             Dropping and replacing a stuck transaction             Disabling crypto wallets in brave                     Risks, Security & Audits             Risks, Security & Audits             Risks             Risks           Liquidity Pools             crvUSD             Lending                   Security & Audits                     Whitepapers             Whitepapers           Curve Stableswap (2019)             Curve DAO (2020)             Curve Cryptopools (2021)             Curve Stablecoin (2022)                     Links             Links           Curve.fi             Curve DAO             Curve News             Discord             Github             Governance Forum             Twitter             Technical Docs             Telegram                   Glossary             Branding & Icons                             Table of contents              Stableswap  ( Curve V1 )                  Cryptoswap  ( Curve V2 )                  Pool Fees                   Rewards & Yield                                Home             Pools              Pools Overview     If you are new to Ethereum or DeFi, liquidity pools are a seemingly complicated concept to understand.    Pools hold multiple assets, allowing users to swap between them. Liquidity providers who deposit assets earn fees from these swaps.   In Curve, pools can be 2 different types, these are:     Stableswap Pools  for coins that are pegged to each other, for example USDC and USDT, or stETH and ETH.    Cryptoswap Pools  which are for assets which fluctuate in value against each other, for example USDT and ETH, or CRV and ETH.     Its important to understand that when you provide liquidity to a pool, no matter what coin you deposit, you essentially  gain exposure to all the coins in the pool  which means you want to find a pool with coins you are comfortable holding.     Liquidity Pool Risks   Before using liquidity pools, it's advisable to review our  risk disclaimer  page for a comprehensive overview of potential risks.       Stableswap  ( Curve V1 )    Stableswap pools have assets pegged to each other. For example USDC and USDT, as their value should always be  close to a 1:1 ratio .   Let's look at an example about how it works for a liquidity provider:         Cryptoswap  ( Curve V2 )    Cryptoswap pools contain unpaired assets like USDC and ETH, whose relative values fluctuate. This necessitates a different pool design than Stableswap.   Cryptoswap pools maintain an equal value balance between their assets. For example, $1,000,000 in USDC would be matched by $1,000,000 worth of ETH.   Let's look at an example about how it works for a liquidity provider:         Pool Fees    Pool fees are specific to each pool, they typically range from 0.01%-0.04%. They are shown under the  pool details  tab on the pool's page. All new pools also have dynamic fees, so in times of high volatility, fees earned by the pools increase.   50% of the pool fees go to the Liquidity Providers  increasing the value of LP tokens, and  50% to DAO (veCRV holders) .   Balanced deposits and withdrawals are free . Imbalanced deposits and withdrawals have a small fee. If fees were 0%, users could, for example, deposit in USDC and withdraw in USDT for free.     Rewards & Yield    Liquidity providers are rewarded with 2 different types of yield:     Base vAPY : This is how much the LP token value is increasing due to accruing pool fees.   Rewards tAPR : These are CRV inflation rewards, other token incentives, and points. Staking LP tokens is required to earn CRV and other token rewards, which accrue through the pool's gauge. Points programs are project-specific; many don't require LP token staking. Refer to each project's point program for the most accurate information.         Some pools include yield-bearing tokens like sUSDe and sDAI. All yield from these tokens goes directly to Liquidity Providers, none is taken away by fees or the pool.

Learn more about v2 pools   For instance, the  CVX/ETH pool  is used in the examples below.   Depositing into the pool    Visit the deposit page ( https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/cvxeth/deposit ). You will need at least one of the two tokens in the pool to deposit. CVX/ETH-pool consists of CVX and ETH.             First, it's important to understand that you don't have to deposit both coins, you can deposit one or both of the coins in the pool and it won't affect your returns. Depositing the coin with the smallest share in the pool will result in a small positive price impact. Since crypto pools have a rebalancing mechanism, the balances of the pool should be relatively equal.   Second, once you deposit one coin,  it gets split over the two different coins in the pool which means you now have exposure to all of them . The first checkbox (Add all coins in a balanced proportion) allows you to deposit both coins in the same proportion they currently are in the pool, resulting in no price impact.   The second checkbox (Deposit Wrapped) allows users to deposit wrapped ETH (wETH) instead of plain ETH.   Confirming and staking    You will then be asked to approve the Curve Finance contract, follow by a deposit transaction which will deposit your into the pool. This transaction can be expensive so you ideally want to wait for gas to be fairly cheap if this will impact the size of your deposit.   After depositing in the pool, you receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens. They represent your share of ownership in the pool and you will need them to stake for CRV.   After depositing, you will be prompted with a new transaction that will deposit your LP tokens in the DAO liquidity gauge. Confirming the transaction  will let you mine CRV.  This second transaction will only pop up if you deposited your tokens under the \"Deposit and stake\" tab. Otherwise it will just deposit the tokens in the pool.   If you already have LP tokens, you can also directly stake them into the gauge under the 'Stake' tab.   Once that's done, you're providing liquidity and staking so all that's left to do is wait for your trading fees to accrue.

Currently, the most common base pool is the 3Pool. It uses the three most liquid stable coins (USDT-USDC-DAI).   Depositing    Metapools offer several options for deposits. For example, in the  GUSD/3Pool  Metapool you can deposit the following:     GUSD   Any of the 3Pool (DAI-USDC-USDT)   3Pool LP token (3crv)             When becoming a liquidity provider, you don't have to deposit all the coins, you can deposit one or several of the coins in the pool and it won't affect your returns. Depositing the coin with the smallest share in the pool will result in a small deposit bonus.   Second, once you deposit one stable coin,  it gets split over the four different coins in the pool which means you now have exposure to all of them . The first checkbox (Add all coins in a balanced proportion) allows you to deposit all four coins in the same proportion they currently are in the pool, resulting in no slippage occurrence.   The  deposit wrapped  option lets you deposit the base pool token (usually 3Pool).           When depositing coins into a metapool, and thus having exposure to a base pool token (e.g., 3CRV) and its paired token, you will earn at the rate of the metapool gauge. However, you'll receive trading fees from both the base and metapool.   Confirming and staking    You will then be asked to approve the Curve Finance contract, follow by a deposit transaction which will wrap your stable coins and deposit them into the pool. This transaction can be expensive so you ideally want to wait for gas to be fairly cheap if this will impact the size of your deposit.   After depositing in the pool, you receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens. They represent your share of ownership in the pool and you will need them to stake for CRV.   After depositing, you will be prompted with a new transaction that will deposit your LP tokens in the DAO liquidity gauge. Confirming the transaction  will let you mine CRV.  This second transaction will only pop up if you deposited your tokens under the \"Deposit and stake\" tab. Otherwise it will just deposit the tokens in the pool.   If you already have LP tokens, you can also directly stake them into the gauge under the 'Stake' tab.   Once that's done, you're providing liquidity and staking so all that's left to do is wait for your trading fees to accrue.

Learn more about v2 pools   For instance, the  TriCRV pool  is used in the examples below.   Depositing into the pool    Visit the deposit page ( https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-4/deposit ). You will need at least one of the three tokens in the pool to deposit. The TriCRV pool consists of CRV, crvUSD, and ETH.             First, it's important to understand that you don't have to deposit all coins, you can deposit one or several of the coins in the pool and it won't affect your returns. Depositing the coin with the smallest share in the pool will result in a small positive price impact. Since crypto pools have a rebalancing mechanism, the balances of the pool should be relatively equal.   Second, once you deposit one coin,  it gets split over the three different coins in the pool which means you now have exposure to all of them . The first checkbox (Add all coins in a balanced proportion) allows you to deposit all three coins in the same proportion they currently are in the pool, resulting in no price impact.   The second checkbox (Deposit Wrapped) allows users to deposit wrapped ETH instead of plain ETH.   Confirming and staking    You will then be asked to approve the Curve Finance contract, follow by a deposit transaction which will deposit your into the pool. This transaction can be expensive so you ideally want to wait for gas to be fairly cheap if this will impact the size of your deposit.   After depositing in the pool, you receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens. They represent your share of ownership in the pool and you will need them to stake for CRV.   After depositing, you will be prompted with a new transaction that will deposit your LP tokens in the DAO liquidity gauge. Confirming the transaction  will let you mine CRV.

After reading this, you should have an understanding of how Curve works, how it makes money for liquidity providers and its risks which is ideally what you want before providing liquidity.   Understanding Curve v1   Curve Finance sUSD pool has quickly become the biggest pool thanks to its SNX incentives which guarantee continuous returns to liquidity providers.   The sUSD pool was born out of a partnership between Curve and Synthetix who sought to help bring stability to their stablecoin sUSD. The pool is not a lending pool which means your main APY only comes from trading fees. The pool has sUSD, DAI, USDC and USDT. Unlike Y pool, the sUSD pool is quite cheap to deposit in making it a good choice if you want to try Curve with a small amount.   The current rewards have no expiry date but can be adjusted by a vote from Synthetix governance.   Depositing into the pool    Visit the deposit page ( https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/susd/deposit ). You will need one or multiple stablecoins to deposit. The sUSD pool takes DAI, USDC, USDT and sUSD.

If you already have LP tokens, you can also directly stake them into the gauge under the 'Stake' tab.   You can claim both those tokens from the minter gauge.

Here are some of the major improvements this pool:     A new rampable A parameter (like on BTC pools) which can adjust liquidity density without causing losses to the virtual price (and to LPs)   Gas optimised   Will be used as a base pool for meta pools (which would essentially allow some pools to seemingly trade against underlying base pools without diluting liquidity)   By only having the three most liquid stable coins in crypto, this pool should grow to become the most liquid and offer the best prices     This pool is expected to become the most liquid and the cheapest to interact with making it a good place to start for newcomers wanting to try Curve with small amounts of capital. Because this pool is likely to offer the best prices, it will also likely be one of the Curve pools getting the most volume.   See how to deposit and stake into the 3Pool:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsRrGij9Ou8             Depositing into the pool    Visit the deposit page ( https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit ). You will need one or multiple stable coins to deposit. The Tri-Pool takes DAI, USDC and USDT.             First, it's important to understand that you don't have to deposit all coins, you can deposit one or several of the coins in the pool and it won't affect your returns. Depositing the coin with the smallest share in the pool will result in a small deposit bonus.   Second, once you deposit one stable coin,  it gets split over the three different coins in the pool which means you now have exposure to all of them . The first checkbox (Add all coins in a balanced proportion) allows you to deposit all three coins in the same proportion they currently are in the pool, resulting in no slippage occurrence.   Confirming and staking    You will then be asked to approve the Curve Finance contract, follow by a deposit transaction which will wrap your stable coins and deposit them into the pool. This transaction can be expensive so you ideally want to wait for gas to be fairly cheap if this will impact the size of your deposit.   After depositing in the pool, you receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens. They represent your share of ownership in the pool and you will need them to stake for CRV.   After depositing, you will be prompted with a new transaction that will deposit your LP tokens in the DAO liquidity gauge. Confirming the transaction  will let you mine CRV.  This second transaction will only pop up if you deposited your tokens under the \"Deposit and stake\" tab. Otherwise it will just deposit the tokens in the pool.   If you already have LP tokens, you can also directly stake them into the gauge under the 'Stake' tab.   Once that's done, you're providing liquidity and staking so all that's left to do is wait for your trading fees to accrue.

Requirements include having a wallet with crvUSD tokens and either ETH or BNB, depending on the bridging direction, to cover transaction fees.     Disclaimer   This guide is  only applicable for bridging crvUSD  to BSC or vice versa. Using the contracts below will only allow the bridging of crvUSD.  Attempting to use other tokens will cause the transaction to revert .       Contract Addresses   Both bridge contracts, on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, have the same contract addres.

Curve operates on several chains, documented here:   Understanding Multichain   Bridges are not operated by Curve, so Curve cannot offer support for using bridges. The following issues may affect users of bridges, so make sure to do research and exercise caution.     Liquidity issues:  Sometimes bridges do not have enough liquidity to process transactions. Usually the bridge will wait to refill liquidity before it permits funds getting processed.   Stuck funds:  Occasionally funds will get moved off one chain, but fail to appear on the new chain in a timely manner. Sometimes this gets resolved by simply waiting. In extreme cases, you should contact the support channels for the bridge in question.

      Understanding multi-chain   Curve exists across several chains, with several more planned. Curve's primary chain will always be Ethereum, but other sidechains have advantages including speed and cost. In order to use Curve on other chains, you must typically send your funds from Ethereum to the sidechain using the chain's bridge.   All of Curve's active chains can be found in the \"Networks\" menu on the Curve homepage.       Supported Sidechains as of 11/14/2022     Connecting your Wallet    When you move to new chains, you will need to connect your wallet with the chain's RPC and chain ID. Generally Curve sidechain pages have a button you can press to automatically switch networks and populate this information for you.     A common issue with sidechains is RPC networks that are temporarily or permanently unavailable. If you are having trouble connecting with RPC networks you may need to visit the chain's support networks to find a new RPC network.   Curve Forks      Tip   For Bridges and CRV contract addresses on other chains please see  Important Bridges .     Curve forks include the following:   Avalanche    Avalanche is a sidechain that bills itself as \"blazingly fast, low-cost and eco-friendly.\" Curve's Avalanche site is hosted at  https://avax.curve.fi/    Arbitrum    Arbitrum is an Optimistic Ethereum L2. Arbitrum validators  optimistically  assume nodes will be operating in good faith, which allows for faster transactions. However, to retroactively allow opportunity to challenge malicious behavior, settlement time can be slower. In some cases this could mean it takes up to one week to bridge funds off-chain, so plan accordingly.  Curve on Arbitrum:  https://curve.fi/#/arbitrum/pools     Binance Smart Chain    Curve does not operate on Binance Smart Chain. The team at Ellipsis ( https://ellipsis.finance/ ) launched a fork of Curve that provides similar functionality. The Curve team authorized this fork, but does not actively maintain this fund.   Fantom    Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, and secure smart contract platform designed to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain networks by utilizing a DAG-based consensus algorithm.  Curve on Fantom:  https://curve.fi/#/fantom/pools   Harmony    Harmony is a proof-of-stake sidechain promising two seconds of transaction speed and a hundred times lower gas fee. Curve's Harmony offerings are at  https://harmony.curve.fi/ .   Optimism    Optimism is verified by a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet and thus not considered a real sidechain. Curve's Optimism branch is located at  https://curve.fi/#/optimism/pools    Polygon    Polygon (previously known as Matic Network) is a multi-chain scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions using Layer 2 sidechains.

One of the main incentives for CRV is the ability to boost rewards on provided liquidity. Vote locking CRV enables the acquisition of voting power to participate in the DAO and earn a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Curve.                 Boosting your CRV rewards             Figuring out the required boost    The first step to getting rewards boosted is to determine the amount of CRV needed for lock. Each gauge has different requirements, meaning some pools are easier to boost than others. This depends on the amount others have locked and the liquidity gauge's capacity.   The calculator can be found at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc   Locking CRV    After determining how much and for how long to lock, visit the following page:  https://dao.curve.fi/locker     Enter the amount to lock and select the expiry. Remember, locking is not reversible. The amount of veCRV received will depend on the amount and duration of the vote lock.   A lock can be extended, and CRV can be added to it at any point, but having CRV with different expiry dates is not possible.   After creating a lock, the next step is to apply the boost.   Applying the boost    Proceed to the minter page:  https://dao.curve.fi/minter/gauges   If the new boost is visible after 'Current boost:', then no further action is required.   If the current boost hasn't updated, it may be necessary to claim CRV from each of the gauges where liquidity is provided to update the boost. After doing so, the boost should be visible.     Locking your Boost   Boosts are only updated when a withdrawal, deposit, or claim is made from a liquidity gauge     Boost Info    The list of pools and boost/reward information has been relocated from the minter page. This information can now be found on each pool page on the classic.curve.fi site.             Alternatively, this information is also available in the new UI ( curve.fi ) under the \"Your Details\" section on the pool page. Note: The new UI does not display future boost yet.             Visit the  old  or  new  dashboard to see all your pools!   Formula    The boost mechanism calculates the  earning weight  of the liquidity you provide to pools and vaults. If you have enough voting weight (veCRV) you will be able to boost the earning weight of the liquidity you provide by up to 2.5x. This means if you have a boost of 2.5x and deposit $10,000 of value to a pool your rewards are for $25,000 of value in the pool. The formula for calculating your boost ( \\(B\\) ) is given below.  \\(B\\)  has a maximum of 2.5 so if the formula gives a value greater than 2.5 then your boost is 2.5.   \\[B = 1.5 \\times \\frac{D \\times v}{V \\times d} + 1\\]   Where:     \\(B\\)  is your rewards boost (if it's more than 2.5 it just equals 2.5).   \\(d\\)  is the value you deposit, in USD.   \\(D\\)  is the total value deposited to the pool/vault, in USD.   \\(v\\)  is the amount of veCRV you have (vote weight).   \\(V\\)  is the total veCRV in the system (total vote weight) click  here  to find the current amount.

To do so go to the following page:  https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/deploy-gauge . If you would like  to deploy a gauge for a lending market , then follow the guide on the  Create Lending Market  page.     Deploying a Pool Gauge with the UI    Go to the Curve page to deploy a gauge here:  https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/deploy-gauge . This page has a switch with 2 options:     Deploy Mainnet Gauge  - Deploy a gauge for a pool on Ethereum Mainnet   Deploy Sidechain Gauge  - Deploy a gauge for a pool on any other chain Curve has deployed to.     These different options have slightly different processes for deploying the gauge, but both options require that you choose the correct pool type for the gauge that is being deployed.   Pool Types:      Stableswap  - a pool with up to 8 pegged assets e.g., USDC and USDT   Two Coin Cryptoswap  - a pool with 2 volatile assets e.g., USDC and ETH   Three Coin Cryptoswap  - a pool with 3 volatile assets e.g., USDC, ETH and CRV   Stableswap (old)  - an old pool with pegged assets e.g., USDC and USDT.   Two Coin Cryptoswap (old)  - an old pool with 2 volatile assets e.g., USDC and ETH     A pool is classified as  old  if it is not a New Generation (NG) pool. If the pool was deployed from 2024 onwards it should be a NG pool. If you are not sure on the pool type then try all options when deploying the gauge, the UI will show an error if the wrong option is chosen or the pool already has a gauge deployed.     Deploy Mainnet Pool Gauge    Go to the  Deploy Gauge  page, and make sure the switch in the right hand corner is set to the left as shown below. The \"Deploy Mainnet Gauge\" screen should be visible as below.     Simply  input the pool address  (0x...) and  select the  pool type  from the drop down menu .  Note the pool type may be pre-selected for you, if this is the case, this does not need to be changed .    After the options have been inputted, click on deploy gauge and submit the transaction using your preferred wallet. The UI will show an error if the incorrect pool type is selected, or a gauge already exists for the pool, so there is no harm in trying all options if you are unsure of the pool type.   After clicking on deploy and the transaction is confirmed the gauge is deployed. A  vote can then be created to add it to the gauge controller . Adding the gauge to the gauge controller allows the gauge to receive CRV rewards for stakers when the gauge is allocated  gauge weight .     Deploy Sidechain Pool Gauge    Sidechain gauges (the same as L2 gauges) work differently to a mainnet gauge. They have a gauge on the sidechain which distributes rewards, as well as a mirror gauge on Ethereum mainnet so that the gauge can receive  gauge weight  and CRV inflation rewards. This parent-child relationship is required because all Curve governance currently happens on Ethereum Mainnet.     Warning   The same address  must  deploy the gauge both on mainnet and the sidechain for this process to work.     To deploy a sidechain gauge go to the  Deploy Gauge  page. The click the switch so it's on the right as shown below. The \"Deploy Sidechain Gauge\" screen will then be shown.     Then connect to the chain you would like to deploy the sidechain gauge to, which is the chain the pool resides on. In this example we are choosing Base as shown below, after choosing and connecting to the network, Step 1 of deploying the sidechain gauge will be shown.     For step 1 simply  input the LP Token Address  (same as pool address for newer pools, but can be different for older pools) and  select the  pool type  from the drop down menu  and click  deploy gauge . The UI will show an error if the incorrect pool type is selected, or a gauge already exists for the pool, so there is no harm in trying all options if you are unsure of the pool type.   After the gauge has been deployed on the sidechain (called the child gauge), the mirror gauge must be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet (the parent gauge), this connects the Sidechain to Ethereum and Curve governance. To go to step 2 click on the little arrow shown in the red rectangle in the picture below:     Then choose the network the pool resides by clicking on the Network dropdown menu, in this example we have chosen base, as that's where the sidechain gauge was deployed. The same pool type as in step 1 must be selected carefully in step 2, as the UI will not raise an error if the wrong option is selected. Then we input the LP Token address (pool address) on the L2.  The LP Token Address in step 2 is the same address as used for step 1 .    After clicking on deploy and the transaction is confirmed, the gauge is deployed and a  vote can be created to add it to the gauge controller . Adding the gauge to the gauge controller allows the gauge to receive CRV rewards for stakers when the gauge is allocated  gauge weight .     Deploy a Gauge for an Ethereum Mainnet Pool via Etherscan    In addition to the UI, there is an option to deploy the gauge directly through Etherscan. If the pool was deployed recently, check the  Deployment Addresses  for the factory contracts, otherwise use the deployment transaction to find which contract deployed the pool/lending market, this will be the factory contract.     Warning   Calling  deploy_gauge  on Etherscan will only work if the function is called on the Factory contract that also deployed the pool.     To navigate to this page, first search for the corresponding Factory contract on Etherscan. Then, go to  Contract -> Write Contract -> deploy_gauge .  Then insert the pool address you want to add a gauge for, press on  Write  and sign the transaction.    Before deploying the gauge, ensure you connect your wallet by clicking the  Connect to Web3  button.               Deploy a Gauge for a Sidechain Pool via Etherscan    To deploy a sidechain gauge we have to deploy 2 different gauges which link together:     Child Gauge  - This is the gauge on the sidechain, it is deployed first.   Root (Parent) Gauge  - This is the gauge on Ethereum Mainnet, it is deployed after the child and links the child gauge to mainnet. The root gauge can be added to the gauge controller, allowing CRV inflation rewards to flow to the sidechain gauge.       Warning   When deploying the Child Gauge and Root Gauge for a sidechain pool, they must be deployed using the  same address  and the  same salt  for  both gauges . This creates the same address for the gauge on the sidechain and ethereum. If the addresses are not the same, the gauges cannot be linked.     Deploying the Sidechain (Child) Gauge    To deploy the sidechain child gauge go to  Deployment Addresses for Sidechain Gauge Factories .   Find the  ChildLiquidityGaugeFactory  address for your sidechain and click on it. This will take you to the contract page on the sidechain's block explorer. Then go to  Contract -> Write Contract -> Connect to Web3 .     After your wallet is connected, find the  deploy_gauge  function. There may be multiple  deploy_gauge  functions, this is because there is an optional parameter called  _manager . If the function doesn't have this option, the manager will be set to your address. It is required that your address is the manager for this gauge, otherwise the root gauge will not be linked to this child gauge.     To call the function first input the  _lp_token  address for the pool, this is the same as the pool address for newer pools, but can be different for older pools. Then input your  _salt , salt is used to create the address for your gauge, this can be anything, but  salt must be the same when deploying this gauge and later when deploying the root gauge , read more about  salt here . Input your address as the  _manager  address if it is required, then click on  write  and submit the transaction.   After the transaction is confirmed the sidechain gauge is deployed.   Deploying the Ethereum Mainchain Root (Parent) Gauge    After the sidechain child gauge has been successfully deployed, the Ethereum mainchain root gauge can be deployed. To do so go back to the  Deployment Addresses for Sidechain Gauge Factories . You should see the table below:     The correct  RootLiquidityGaugeFactory  contract on Ethereum must be chosen. Most root gauges for sidechains are deployed using the top contract boxed in blue, but some sidechains use their own special contracts, e.g., see the contract for Fractal boxed in red, or the BSC contract boxed in yellow. If there isn't a specific  RootLiquidityGaugeFactory  for your sidechain, then use the first one. Once the correct contract is found click on the address and you will be taken to the contract page on etherscan.   Once again go to  Contract -> Write Contract -> Connect to Web3  to connect your wallet as shown above.  This must be the same wallet that deployed the sidechain child gauge . Then click on the  deploy_gauge  function.      In this function the  payableAmount  can be inputted as 0, the  _chain_id  must be the chain id of the sidechain your pool and gauge is on. This can be easily found from  chainlist.org . The  _salt  must be the same as the salt used to deploy the sidechain child gauge.   Click on  write , and submit the transaction, after this is complete the gauge is root gauge is deployed and this process is complete. You can now submit a gauge vote to get the root gauge added to the gauge controller, see the process below.     Submit a DAO Vote    In order for a gauge to become eligible to receive CRV emissions, it has to be added to the GaugeController. This needs to be approved by the DAO.   Once you've created your gauge, you can submit it to the DAO for a vote:  https://classic.curve.fi/factory/create_vote .   If the gauge is for a pool on a sidechain, input the parent gauge address (Ethereum gauge address) here.   The address that submits must have 2500 veCRV in order to create a vote.     Once the gauge has been submitted, politics take over. You may want to visit the governance forum and explain why your pool should be made eligible for rewards.

Home             Liquidity Gauges              Gauge weights   What are gauge weights?    Simply put, a gauge weight translates into how much of the daily CRV inflation it receives.   For example on the below chart, the Y pool is currently receiving around 72% of the daily CRV inflation. This means that all liquidity providers in the Y pool share 72% of the daily CRV.     You can find each liquidity gauge relative weight on this page:  https://dao.curve.fi/minter/gauges    Why are gauge weights so important?    Because those weights decide where the CRV inflation goes, it allows the DAO to control where most of the liquidity should go and balance liquidity. It's a powerful tool for voters that must be used responsibly.   The gauge weight is updated once a week on Thursdays.   Who can vote for gauge weights?    Anybody who has vote  locked CRV  can vote to direct its voting power towards one or multiple Curve pools.   How can I vote?    Visit this link:  https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight    Select the gauge you would like to put your voting weight towards, enter an amount in BPS (10,000 = 100% the maximum) and confirm your transaction.   How often can I move my voting weight?    You can change your voting weight once every 10 days.   What happens when I add additional CRV to my existing lock or extend the locktime?    Adding more $CRV to your lock or extending the locktime increases your veCRV balance. This increase is not automatically accounted for in your current gauge weight votes. If you want to allocate all of your newly acquired voting power, make sure to re-vote.     Warning   Resetting your gauge weight before re-voting means you'll need to wait 10 days to vote for the gauges whose weight you've reset. So, please ensure you simply re-vote; there is no need to reset your gauge weight votes before voting again.

It's assumed that the user possesses some familiarity with Etherscan or are competent in executing the transaction through an alternative tool.    These rewards are called  permissionless as the CurveDAO does not control them . They are not completely permissionless however, as  only the admin or manager of the gauge can approve and add these token rewards .     Warning   Note that Curve has employed various gauge versions over time. If your attempts are unsuccessful, it might be due to version differences. Please don't hesitate to reach out to the Curve team.     Permissionless rewards are added in the following flow:     Set reward token and distributor address.   Approve reward token.   Add rewards.     Setting the Reward Token and Distributor Address    By calling the  add_reward  function on a specific gauge a token can be added to the gauge's list of approved reward tokens. To call the function the  reward token  contract address and the  distributor address  must be specified. The distributor address is the source from which the reward token will be sent to the gauge.     Info   Ensure you have the required  admin/manager  permissions for the gauge. The address that deployed the gauge is set as the  admin/manager . If you are not admin/manager, the transaction will fail.     To identify the manager, check the  manager/admin  in the \"Read Contract\" section on Etherscan. Some versions of this contract may also allow the factory owner to execute this call.   The deployer of the gauge is usually the manager of the gauge if the gauge was deployed via the Factory Contracts.   This function should be called only once for a specific reward token. A repeated call to  add_reward  using a previously set reward token will fail. However, the distributor address for an already added reward token can be updated using the  set_reward_distributor  function. Over the lifetime of a gauge, a total of 8 different reward tokens can be set.     add_reward(_reward_token: address, _distributor: address):   Function to add specify a reward token and distributor for the gauge. Once a reward tokens is added, it can not be removed anymore.           Parameter   Type   Description           _reward_token   address   Reward Token Address       _distributor   address   Distributor Address, who can add the Reward Token           Approving the Reward Token for Deposit    Visit the reward token's contract address (not the gauge contract address) on Etherscan and switch to the \"Write Contract\" tab. Use the  approve  function, setting the spender as the gauge contract address and specifying the desired amount.     approve(_spender : address, _value : uint256) -> bool:   Function to approve  _spender  to transfer  _value  tokens.           Parameter   Type   Description           _spender   address   Gauge Contract Address       _value   uint256   Amount to approve           Depositing the Reward Token    When depositing the reward token to the contract a time period is chosen ( _epoche  seconds). After depositing the reward epoch begins, lasting the defined number of seconds chosen by the depositor ( _epoch  seconds). Rewards are streamed at a constant rate per second to all gauge stakers over the epoch time period. If no additional rewards of this token are deposited before the end of this time period, the rewards stop when the time period elapses.   Reward epochs are token specific. Different reward tokens can have different epoch time periods.   If additional rewards for a currently streaming token are added mid epoch, both the newly added tokens and all the remaining tokens are combined (rewards = remaining + new), triggering a fresh epoch for the newly defined period of time.   For consistent reward distributions, it's advisable to deposit near the end of an epoch. If replenishing mid-epoch, ensure you compute the appropriate amount for a steady distribution rate.    More information  here .     deposit_reward_token(_reward_token: address, _amount: uint256, _epoch: uint256 = WEEK)   Function to deposit  _amount  of  _reward_token  into the gauge over the period of  _epoch  seconds.   When depositing it is optional to use the  _epoch  parameter. This is set to  WEEK  which means the rewards will be streamed to the gauge stakers over a 1 week period (604800 seconds).

This usage is measured with gauges. The liquidity gauge measures how much a user is providing in liquidity.   The liquidity gauge measures how many dollars you have provided in a Curve pool. Each Curve pool has its own liquidity gauge where you can stake your liquidity provider tokens   The weight system    For a gauge to be able to receive CRV emissions it has to be added to the GaugeController. Each gauge also has a weight and a type. Those weights represent how much of the daily CRV inflation will be received by the liquidity gauge.   The DAO    The weight systems allow the Curve DAO to dictate where the CRV inflation should go. You can vote at this address:  https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight    By doing so, you can put your voting power towards the liquidity gauge (or pool) you think should receive the most CRV.

These audits aim to uncover potential vulnerabilities and ensure that the protocol's smart contracts function as intended.    However, as with all DeFi platforms, users should be aware that engaging with Curve Finance carries inherent risks. Despite the thoroughness of audits, they  do not guarantee complete security , and potential vulnerabilities might still emerge in the future.    Therefore, individuals should always proceed with caution and understand that the  use of the protocol is at their own risk .

Positions are managed passively: if the collateral's price decreases, the system automatically sells off collateral in a soft liquidation mode. If the collateral's price increases, the system recovers the collateral. This process could lead to some losses due to liquidation and de-liquidation. Additional information can be found on  LLAMMA Overview .     Please consider the following risk disclaimers when using the Curve Stablecoin infrastructure:         If your collateral enters soft-liquidation mode, you can't withdraw it or add more collateral to your position.   Should the price of the collateral change drop sharply over a short time interval, it can result in large losses that may reduce your loan's health.   If you are in soft-liquidation mode and the price of the collateral goes up sharply, this can result in de-liquidation losses on the way up. If your loan's health is low, value of collateral going up could potentially reduce your underwater loan's health.   If the health of your loan drops to zero or below, your position will get hard-liquidated with no option of de-liquidation. Please choose your leverage wisely, as you would with any collateralized debt position.         The crvUSD stablecoin and its infrastructure are currently in beta testing. As a result, investing in crvUSD carries high risk and could lead to partial or complete loss of your investment due to its experimental nature. You are responsible for understanding the associated risks of buying, selling, and using crvUSD and its infrastructure.       The value of crvUSD can fluctuate due to stablecoin market volatility or rapid changes in the liquidity of the stablecoin.       crvUSD is exclusively issued by smart contracts, without an intermediary. However, the parameters that ensure the proper operation of the crvUSD infrastructure are subject to updates approved by Curve DAO. Users must stay informed about any parameter changes in the stablecoin infrastructure.

enables users to permissionlessly create and interact with isolated lending pairs composed of crvUSD, a decentralized stablecoin native to the Curve ecosystem, and various paired tokens. The notifications provided herein address risks associated with Curve Lending activities. The following list is not exhaustive.   Users wishing to acquaint themselves with a broader range of general risk disclosures are encouraged to read the  Curve Risk Disclosures for Liquidity Providers . Users are also advised to review the public  audit reports  to assess the security and reliability of the platform before engaging in any lending or borrowing activities.     Permissionless Markets Risks    Curve Lending markets are permissionless, allowing anyone to create and customize markets with unique token pairs, a price oracle, and parameters that influence the LLAMMA liquidation algorithm and interest rate model. Given the protocol's permissionless nature, users should verify that the market has been instantiated with sensible parameters. Curve provides a  LLAMMA-simulator  that can be referenced for finding optimal parameters.   There are several factors users should consider regarding attributes of the permissionless markets:   1) Unvetted Tokens    Curve Lending pairs consist of crvUSD and one other token, which may not undergo rigorous vetting due to the permissionless lending factory and lack of strict onboarding criteria. As a result, some tokens in Curve pools could be unvetted, introducing potential risks such as exchange rate volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, and liquidity risks. Users should exercise caution and conduct their due diligence before interacting with any token on the platform.   2) Oracle Designation    Curve Lending markets by default use a Curve pool as the oracle, as long as the pool pair contains both tokens in the market and the pool is a Curve tricrypto-ng, twocrypto-ng or stableswap-ng pool, which has manipulation-resistant oracles. However, this creates a dependency on the selected pool oracle, which may become unreliable due to market circumstances (e.g., liquidity migration) or technical bugs.   Alternatively, market deployers may designate a custom oracle, which can introduce additional trust assumptions or technical risks, and these custom oracles may need to be thoroughly vetted due to permissionless market deployment. Users should fully understand the oracle mechanism before interacting with a Curve Lending market.   3) Parameter Configuration    There are several parameters configurable by market deployers, including \"A\" (number of bands within the LLAMMA algorithm), fee on LLAMMA swaps, loan discount (Loan-To-Value), liquidation discount (Liquidation Threshold), and min/max borrow rate. Misconfigured AMM parameters may result in greater losses than necessary during liquidation and generally negatively impact user experience involving liquidation. Misconfigured borrow rates may prevent the market from adequately reflecting rates in the broader market, potentially leading to insufficient withdrawal liquidity for lenders. Users should be aware of market parameter configurations and ensure they are suitable for the underlying assets and anticipated market conditions.   4) Governance    The Curve Lending admin is the Curve DAO, a decentralized organization made up of veCRV tokenholders. Votes are required to make any change to the Curve Lending system, including individual markets. Votes undergo a 1-week vote period, requiring a 51% approval and a sufficient voter quorum to execute any on-chain actions. The DAO controls critical system functions in Curve Lending, including setting system contract implementations and configuring parameters such as min/max borrow rates, borrow discounts and AMM fees.   Borrowing Risks    Borrowers can choose from various lending markets to borrow crvUSD against another asset or provide crvUSD as collateral. Markets are designated as one-way or two-way. In one-way markets, collateral cannot be lent out to other users. These assets serve solely as collateral to secure the loan and maintain the borrowing capacity within the protocol. Two-way markets allow collateral to be lent out, creating an opportunity for borrowers to earn interest.   Soft and Hard Liquidation    Curve Lending uses a \"soft\" liquidation process powered by the LLAMMA algorithm. LLAMMA is a market-making contract that manages the liquidation and de-liquidation of collateral via arbitrageurs. This mechanism facilitates arbitrage between the collateral and borrowed asset in line with changes in market price, allowing a smoother liquidation process that strives to minimize user losses. Additional information can be found in the  LLAMMA Overview  docs.   Please consider the following risks when using the Curve Stablecoin infrastructure:     If your collateral enters soft-liquidation mode, you can't withdraw it or add more collateral to your position.   If the price of your collateral drops sharply over a short time interval, it can result in higher losses that may reduce your loan's health.   If you are in soft-liquidation mode and the price of the collateral appreciates sharply, this can also result in de-liquidation losses. If your loan's health is low, collateral price appreciation can further reduce the loan's health, potentially triggering a hard liquidation.   If the health of your loan drops to zero or below, your position will get hard-liquidated with no option of de-liquidation.     Borrowers should be aware that, while in soft liquidation, they essentially pay a fee to arbitrageurs in the form of favorable pricing. This will gradually erode the health of the position, especially during times of high volatility and, importantly, even when the market price of their collateral is increasing. This activity can decrease the position's health and cause it to undergo \"hard\" liquidation, whereby the collateral is sold off and the Borrower's position is closed. Borrowers are advised to monitor market conditions and actively manage their collateral to mitigate the liquidation risk. Borrowers should also be aware that if the loan's health falls below a certain threshold, hard liquidation could occur, leading to collateral loss.   Interest Rates    The borrowing rate is algorithmically determined based on the utilization rate of the lending markets. It is calculated using a function that accounts for the spectrum of borrowing activity, ranging from conditions where no assets are borrowed (where the rate is set to a minimum) to conditions where all available assets are borrowed (where the rate is set to a maximum). The rates within the described monetary policy are subject to changes only by Curve DAO. More information on the interest rate model can be found in the Semi-log Monetary Policy docs.   Lending Risks    When participating in lending activities on Curve Lending, Users may deposit crvUSD (or other assets designated for borrowing) into non-custodial Vaults that accrue interest from borrowers. There may also be the opportunity for additional CRV incentives by staking Vault tokens in a Gauge contract, pending DAO approval.   Risk of Illiquidity    While these Vaults enable Users to supply liquidity and potentially earn returns, Users maintain the right to withdraw their assets at any time, so long as liquidity is available. There may be temporary or permanent states of illiquidity that prevent Lenders from fully or partially withdrawing their funds. This may result from diverse circumstances, including excessive borrow demand, a poorly configured interest rate model, a failure associated with the collateral asset, or a drastic reduction in incentives to a market. Similarly, there may be high volatility in the behavior of either lenders, borrowers, or both, which causes sharp swings in interest rates.   Risk of Bad Debt    In extreme scenarios, Lenders may experience a shortfall through the accumulation of bad debt. This may occur if collateral prices fall sharply, especially in combination with network congestion that inhibits timely liquidation of positions. In such cases, Borrowers may need a financial motive to repay their debt, and Lenders may race to withdraw any available liquidity, saddling the Lenders remaining in the Vault with the shortfall.   Curve Lending is designed to minimize the risk of bad debt through over-collateralization and the LLAMMA liquidation algorithm. While over-collateralization and the LLAMMA algorithm act as risk mitigation tools, they do not fully insulate Lenders from the inherent risks associated with Curve Lending and assets in its markets, including smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, failures in economic models, and regulatory challenges that threaten product viability. Lenders are advised to understand their exposure to risks associated with the collateral asset in Vaults they choose to interact with and appreciate the possibility of experiencing partial or total loss.     crvUSD Risks    Users should be mindful of risks associated with exposure to the crvUSD stablecoin:     Investing in crvUSD carries inherent risks that could lead to partial or complete loss of your investment due to its experimental nature. You are responsible for understanding the risks of buying, selling, and using crvUSD and its infrastructure.   The value of crvUSD can fluctuate due to stablecoin market volatility or rapid changes in the liquidity of the stablecoin.   crvUSD is exclusively issued by smart contracts, without an intermediary. However, the parameters that ensure the proper operation of the crvUSD infrastructure are subject to updates approved by Curve DAO. Users must stay informed about any parameter changes in the stablecoin infrastructure.   crvUSD is not recognized as legal tender by any authority and is not guaranteed to be accepted for payments, subject to changing regulatory landscapes which may affect its legality and utility.   Information provided by crvUSD front-end is solely for educational purposes and does not constitute any form of professional advice, leaving users solely responsible for ensuring actions meet their financial goals.   Despite efforts to maintain price stability, crvUSD faces the risk of depegging due to market volatility, regulatory changes, or technological issues, potentially affecting its value.   Users of crvUSD are exposed to various technological risks, including irreversible transactions, anonymity and security concerns, software dependency, cybersecurity threats, and operational and settlement risks, which can lead to potential asset loss.   The continued development and functionality of the crvUSD protocol rely on developer contributions, with no guarantee of sustained involvement, posing a risk to its maintenance and scalability.     General Financial Risks    Volatility    Users should be aware that the prices of cryptocurrencies and tokens are highly volatile and subject to dramatic fluctuations due to their speculative nature and variable acceptance as a payment method. The market value of blockchain-based assets can significantly decline, potentially resulting in losses. Transactions within blockchain systems, including Ethereum Mainnet and others, may experience variable costs and speeds, affecting asset access and usability. Users are encouraged to develop their strategies for managing volatility.   Financial Loss    Users should know that cryptocurrencies and tokens are highly experimental and carry significant risks. Engaging in lending and borrowing activities involves irreversible, final, and non-refundable transactions. Users must participate in these activities at their own risk, understanding that the potential for financial loss is substantial. Users are advised to carefully evaluate their lending and borrowing strategies, considering their personal circumstances and financial resources to determine the most suitable situation.   Use of Financial Terms    Financial terms used in the context of Curve Lending, such as \"debt,\" \"lend,\" \"borrow,\" and similar, are meant for analogy purposes only. They draw comparisons between the operations of decentralized finance smart contracts and traditional finance activities, emphasizing the automated and deterministic nature of DeFi systems. These terms should not be interpreted in their traditional financial context, as DeFi transactions involve distinct mechanisms and risks. Users are encouraged to understand the specific meanings within the DeFi framework.     For up-to-date risk disclaimer, click  here .

Before making a deposit, it is best to research and understand the risks involved.   Curve Whitepapers   Smart Contract Audits     Technology Risk    Smart Contract Risk:    Curve relies on smart contracts, which are self-executing pieces of code. While these contracts are designed to be secure, there is a risk that they may contain vulnerabilities or bugs. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting in the loss of funds or other adverse consequences. It is essential for users to conduct due diligence and review the smart contracts and security audit reports to assess the inherent risks.   Curve smart contracts have undergone multiple audits by reputable firms including Trail of Bits, MixBytes, QuantStamp, and ChainSecurity to enhance protocol security. While smart contract audits play an important role in good security practices to mitigate user risks, they don't eliminate all risks. Users should always exercise caution regardless of Curve's commitment to protocol security.   Immutability and Irreversibility of Transactions:    When you engage in transactions on Ethereum or EVM-compatible blockchains, it is important to understand that these transactions are immutable and irreversible. Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be modified, reversed, or deleted. This means that if a user sends funds to an incorrect address or engage in a fraudulent transaction, it may not be possible to recover the funds. It is crucial to exercise caution, verify transaction details, and use secure wallets to minimize the risk of irreversible transactions.     Counterparty Risk    Access Control:    Curve pool smart contracts are intentionally designed to be immutable and noncustodial, meaning they cannot be upgraded and liquidity providers always retain full control of their funds. While this characteristic may limit protective actions in case of emergencies, it significantly strengthens user assurances about custody of their funds.   The Curve protocol is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) comprised of veCRV tokenholders that requires a 1-week vote period with 51% approval and a sufficient voter quorum to execute any actions. It controls critical system functions, including the implementation of new system contracts and the adjustment of system parameters.   The Curve Emergency Admin is a 5-of-9 multisig composed of Curve community members. It has restricted rights to undertake actions that do not directly impact users' funds, including canceling parameter changes authorized by the DAO and halting CRV emissions to a pool. Early pool implementations included a timelimited function to freeze swaps and deposits in case of emergency, but this precautionary function has since been deprecated in current pool implementations.     Asset Risk    Permanent Loss of a Peg:    Stablecoins and other derivative assets are designed to maintain a peg to a reference asset. If one of the pool assets drops below its peg, it effectively means that liquidity providers in the pool hold almost all their liquidity in that token. The depegged token may never recover as a result of a technical failure, insolvency, or other adverse situations.   If the token fails to regain its peg, liquidity providers will encounter losses proportional to the severity of the depeg. The potential permanent loss highlights the importance of thorough consideration and caution when participating in activities involving stablecoins and/or derivative assets.   Impermanent Loss:    Providing liquidity to Curve pools may expose users to the risk of impermanent loss. Fluctuations in asset prices after supplying to a pool can result in losses when users remove liquidity. Before engaging in liquidity provision activities, users are advised to carefully evaluate the potential for impermanent loss and consider their own risk tolerance.   StableSwap  pools are designed to mitigate impermanent loss by pairing assets that are expected to exhibit mean-reverting behavior. This assumption may not hold true in every case, requiring diligent assessment when interacting with these pools.   CryptoSwap V2  pools are designed with an internal oracle to concentrate liquidity around the current market price. The algorithm attempts to offset the effects of impermanent loss by calculating fees generated by the pool and ensuring the pool is in profit before re-pegging. Impermanent loss may still occur in CryptoSwap V2 pools, particularly when the earned fees are insufficient to counterbalance the impact of re-pegging. This underscores the need for users to be attentive about the dynamics of these pools when making decisions about liquidity provision.   Price Volatility:    Cryptocurrencies and ERC20 tokens have historically exhibited significant price volatility. They can experience rapid and substantial fluctuations in value, which may occur within short periods of time. The market value of any token may rise or fall, and there is no guarantee of any specific price stability.   The overall market dynamics, including price volatility, liquidity fluctuations, and broader economic factors, can impact the value of user funds when providing liquidity. Sudden market movements or unexpected events can result in losses that may be difficult to anticipate or mitigate.   Unvetted Tokens:    Due to the permissionless pool factory and the absence of strict onboarding criteria, not every token included in Curve pools undergoes a detailed independent risk assessment. Curve pools may contain unvetted tokens that have uncertain value or potential fraudulent characteristics. The presence of unvetted tokens introduces potential risks, including exchange rate volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidity risks, and other unforeseen circumstances that could result in the loss of funds or other adverse consequences.   When participating as a liquidity provider in any pool, users should carefully assess the tokens' functionality, security audits, team credibility, community feedback, and other relevant factors to make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks associated with the pool assets.   Pools with Lending Assets:    Due to composability within DeFi, it is possible for assets in Curve pools to be receipt tokens for deposits in third party lending platforms. Composability of this sort can amplify yields for liquidity providers, but it also exposes users to additional risks associated with the underlying lending protocol. Users interacting with pools that involve lending assets should be mindful of this additional risk and conduct due diligence on the associated lending protocol.     Regulatory Risk    Regulatory Uncertainty:    The regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain technology, DeFi protocols, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and related activities is constantly evolving, resulting in regulatory uncertainty. The lack of clear and consistent regulations may impact legal obligations, compliance requirements, and potential risks associated with the protocol activities.

You've submitted a transaction in Metamask and it just won't come through. Those gas estimates betrayed you and you're stuck looking at your pending transaction on Etherscan. It's happened to everyone and it's not pleasant but there's a fairly simple solution which most people will come to learn about.   This guide isn't Curve Finance specific but as gas prices are reaching new highs, stuck transactions are getting more common and knowing how to drop and replace is thus become more and more useful.   First and foremost, it's important to understand you can only do this if your transaction is pending. If it isn't your transaction cannot be cancelled anymore.   If you want to understand how this works, you should know that Ethereum transactions must be submitted with an incremental nonce. Each transaction has a nonce (a number) assigned to it and a number cannot be skipped. The way to replace and drop is to submit a new transaction with a higher gas price and the same nonce. This will tell the miners this more expensive transaction is the one that should be mined and your stuck transaction will be discarded.   Enable custom nonce in Metamask    Visit Metamask and select \"Settings\", then \"Advanced\" and scroll down to find and enable \"Customize transaction nonce\".     Finding your pending transaction nonce    Visit your address on Etherscan and click on your pending transaction. If you scroll down you will find \"Nonce\":     Write down this nonce and return to Metamask.   Replacing your transaction    Now that you have your nonce, go back to Ethereum and send yourself 0 Ethereum, on the confirmation screen, type the nonce you got from Etherscan.   Make sure your gas price is suitable this time by checking  https://ethgasstation.info/  for example.     Confirm your transaction and that's it. Your 0 Ethereum transaction should be mined which will drop and replace your stuck transaction which you can confirm on Etherscan.

If Curve has lost transaction of your cross asset swap, do not panic, there is a simple way to recover it.   Finding the token id    Visit your address on Etherscan and click on ERC721:     And then click on your latest cross-asset swap, you should find a long string of numbers like below:     Initiate recovery    Visit:  https://classic.curve.fi/recover    Enter your token id found on Etherscan, enter your the token you would like to receive (if your token has sBTC then it must be a Bitcoin token that shares a pool with sBTC, if your token is sUSD, it should be a token that shares a pool with sUSD) and then click recover.   Confirm your transaction and you're done.

Home             Locked CRV (veCRV)              Claiming Trading Fees   Every time a trade occurs on Curve Finance,  50% of the trading fee is collected by users who have vote-locked their CRV . Furthermore, since the introduction of Curve's stablecoin, crvUSD, all  accumulated interest rate fees  are awarded to veCRV holders.   As of 20 th  June, 2024, fees are now  distributed in crvUSD  instead of 3CRV pool tokens.   Fees are collected weekly from the pools, converted to crvUSD, and then distributed. See the  \"How does it all work?\" section  for how this process works. Users who lock CRV can claim trading fees as often as they wish; however, fees will only be converted into crvUSD once a week.     Info   There is a delay before the first claim of crvUSD can be made after locking. A wait of 8 days from the Thursday following the lock is required before a claim can be done.       New UI    To claim trading fees, visit  https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/dashboard  and click the  Claim LP Rewards  button.                Info   3CRV and crvUSD are both shown on this UI as some users may not have claimed their 3CRV fees yet.       Classic UI      Warning   The classic UI has not been updated to claim crvUSD fees.     when using the  classic UI  please visit:  https://classic.curve.fi/  and look for the green  Claim  button in the box labeled  veCRV 3pool LP claim  at the bottom of the page.               Swapping 3CRV for a Stable Coin      Note   No more 3CRV will be distributed as fees going forward . The last week of 3CRV fees was 13 th  June, 2024. However, there may be users who haven't claimed their 3CRV yet, so this information is left for them.     3CRV is the liquidity provider (LP) token of the 3pool, which consists of USDC, USDT, and DAI. If the pool is perfectly balanced with 33% USDC, 33% USDT, and 33% DAI, then one 3CRV will represent 0.33 USDC, 0.33 USDT, and 0.33 DAI.   If a user wishes to withdraw 3CRV back into a stablecoin, they can do so at:  https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/withdraw . The user needs to select the stablecoin they would like to receive (withdrawing in a balanced or custom proportion is also an option) and click  Withdraw . After the transaction is confirmed, they will receive the withdrawn stablecoin.               Note   When withdrawing 3CRV into a stablecoin, it  might be beneficial to take a look at the balance ratios of the pool . Withdrawing in a token with a higher balance than the other two could result in a small premium for that token. On the other hand, withdrawing a token with a lower balance relative to the other two coins may lead to receiving a slightly lesser amount. Further information can be found  here .       How does it all work?    When the burn process is initiated, a contract collects fees, which come in dozens of different forms such as stablecoins, volatile assets, or LP tokens. These tokens are then burned through various contracts and pools, and converted into crvUSD through swapping in Cowswap.   Burning is a costly process due to the complexity and number of transactions involved. However, anyone can trigger this process at any time, provided they are willing to cover the associated costs.   Fees can only be claimed for the week that has already concluded, as the burner cannot determine each user's entitlement before the end of that period. Fees will be made available  weekly, within 24 hours after Thursday midnight UTC , as long as someone  typically the Curve team  has initiated the burn process beforehand.     Info   See the  Fee Collection & Distribution page  for more information about this process.

Admin Fees    The revenue comes in the form of admin fees. There are three different ways these accrue and are collected:   Stableswap Fees    Stableswap admin fees are 50% of the total fee charged using a Stableswap pool. The fee is taken in the output token of the swap and calculated against the final amount received. For example, if swapping from USDC to DAI, the fee is taken in DAI. Because of this every week each coin in the pool will have accrued fees that can be collected, e.g., for the pool below Admin Fees in USDC and DAI can both be collected.     Cryptoswap Fees    Cryptoswap admin fees are 50% of the total fee charged from a Cryptoswap pool. As Cryptoswap pools always maintain balance, these fees accrue in the LP token of a pool, which represents an equal share of all assets in the pool. LP shares are collected each week for these pools.     crvUSD Minting Market Fees    All accrued interest on debt in crvUSD minting markets is collected as crvUSD. Also the AMM for crvUSD minting markets (LLAMMA) has the ability to collect admin fees on swaps, but currently all fees in these pools go to liquidity providers.       Fee Collection & Distribution Architecture    Currently there are two ways fee collection, and distribution is being achieved. The old way relies on hardcoding exchange routes for each coin collected, and the manual collection of these each week. This is being phased out as a new architecture has been developed which incentivizes 3 rd  parties to do the collection of fees and uses  Cowswap's conditional orders  to flexibly sell any coin/token collected.   The distribution of each week's fees happens on Thursday. The fees are evenly split between all veCRV and can be claimed by veCRV holders at any time. See  How to Claim veCRV Trading Fees  for more information.     The New Cowswap Architecture    The new Cowswap Architecture is based around a 4 phases occurring on different days of the week. These phases are:  collection  on Monday,  exchanging  on Tuesday,  forwarding  on Wednesday and  distribution  on Thursday. See below for further details about each phase.   Collection  - Monday    The  collection  phase occurs on Monday, it makes sure any significant amounts of fees are collected and ready to be sold the following day.   Newer pools automatically claim admin fees throughout the week when users withdraw their liquidity from the pools.    Otherwise, on Monday anyone can call functions which claim the fees from pools and then create conditional orders on Cowswap to sell the coins/tokens on Tuesday. Doing this work is incentivized by giving the caller a reward.     Exchanging  - Tuesday    The  exchanging  phase happens on Tuesday. In this phase the conditional sell orders which were created on Monday during the  collection  phase can be executed by Cowswap searchers. Each coin/token is swapped separately, and by the end of the day all coins and tokens should be swapped into the target coin (currently crvUSD).     Forwarding  - Wednesday    The  forwarding  phase happens on Wednesday. All the target coin (currently crvUSD) which was exchanged for on Tuesday is forwarded to the Fee Distributor on Ethereum Mainnet through an intermediary contract called a hooker. The hooker contract is a future proofing contract which can implement any arbitrary functions that are approved by the DAO. Calling the function to do this transfer is incentivized by giving the caller a reward.   Distribution  - Thursday    Fees are distributed to veCRV holders weekly, within 24 hours after Thursday 00:00 UTC. These fees are split evenly among all veCRV holders, who can claim their share once each week after distribution. Users can first claim trading fees 8 days after the first Thursday following their lock. For example, if you lock on a Tuesday, you can claim trading fees 10 days later on Thursday. See  How to Claim veCRV Trading Fees  for more information.     Info   For more technical information regarding this new process please see the fee collection and distribution pages on the technical documentation:  https://docs.curve.fi/curve_dao/fee-collection-distribution/curve-burner/overview/       Old Architecture    This is outdated and is currently being phased out.    Collection    Collection happened manually by calling withdraw functions on pools and crvUSD markets.   Exchanging (Burning)    This happened manually by hardcoding in different exchange routes for each token, e.g., to transfer wstETH to 3CRV (the old target coin) the process was:     wstETH  to  stETH  via unwrapping (wstETH Burner)   stETH  to  ETH  via swap through stETH/ETH curve pool (SwapStableBurner)   ETH  to  USDT  via swap through tricrypto pool (CryptoSwapBurner)   USDT  to  3CRV  via depositing into 3pool (StableDepositBurner)     This process worked well, but became cumbersome when an exchange route was needed for every coin in every pool. The exchanges also needed to be called manually.   Distribution    After the exchanging process is completed distribution happens by forwarding the exchanged coins to the fee distributor on Ethereum Mainnet. Fees are distributed to veCRV holders weekly, within 24 hours after Thursday 00:00 UTC. These fees are split evenly among all veCRV holders, who can claim their share once each week after distribution. Users can first claim trading fees 8 days after the first Thursday following their lock. For example, if you lock on a Tuesday, you can claim trading fees 10 days later on Thursday.

Locking is  not reversible  and veCRV tokens are  non-transferable . If a user decides to vote-lock their CRV tokens, they will only be able to  reclaim the CRV tokens after the lock duration has ended .   Additionally, a user  cannot have multiple locks with different expiry dates . However, a lock  can be extended , or  additional CRV can be added  to it  at any time .     Users must specify the amount of CRV they wish to lock and their preferred lock duration. The minimum lock period is  one week , while the maximum is  four years . The amount of veCRV  linearly decays over time , reaching 0 when the lock duration ends.

Users can lock their CRV for a  minimum of 1 week ,  maximum of 4 years , in return the user is given veCRV,  veCRV amount  decays  linearly over the chosen lock time .  veCRV is not transferrable . The longer you lock the more veCRV you receive, see the  locking formula section  for a detailed explanation but the simple explanation is:     1 CRV locked for 4 years = 1 veCRV   1 CRV locked for 3 years = 0.75 veCRV   1 CRV locked for 2 years = 0.5 veCRV   1 CRV locked for 1 year = 0.25 veCRV     Locking was a concept created to align incentives for governance . Many coin voting systems have a problem where someone can buy tokens off the market to influence a governance vote, then sell the tokens after the vote passed/failed. These users can influence governance votes greatly and only take minimal risk by holding tokens for a few days. Locking stops this happening. Users must lock their tokens for a period of time to receive voting power, and users are rewarded with more voting power if they lock their tokens for a longer period of time.   To find out how to lock see the guide here:  lock CRV tokens     Info   The amount of veCRV shown as a statistic in various places is not a true reflection of the amount of locked CRV. As 1 veCRV does not equal 1 CRV due to locking time and decay. Read the  locking information  section of this page for more information     veCRV Benefits    Users with veCRV are given the following benefits:   Earning Fees    After 2 community-led proposals and subsequent governance votes in September 2020 (Link to votes:  [1] ,  [2] ), the admin fees of Curve pools were set to 50%, this means  50% of all trading fees are distributed to veCRV holders , while the remaining 50% goes to the respective liquidity providers of the pools. This distribution was implemented to align the incentives between liquidity providers and governance participants (veCRV holders). Additionally, since the launch of Curve's own stablecoin (crvUSD),  100% of the accrued interest from crvUSD markets  also goes to veCRV holders. veCRV holders don't receive any direct value from lending markets, but they do receive indirect value from increasing crvUSD supply.   All collected fees are converted to  crvUSD  and distributed among veCRV holders. See  Claiming Trading Fees  for how to claim, or  Fee Collection & Distribution  for how they are collected.   Boosting CRV Rewards    One of the primary incentives for vote-locking is the  boost mechanism . Users who provide liquidity to a swap pool and/or lending market with a reward gauge and have some vote-locked CRV  receive boosted CRV rewards . See  Boosting your CRV rewards  for more information.   Governance        The veCRV balance represents the voting power of a user in the Curve DAO, which allows them to  vote on on-chain proposals .        Additionally, a crucial part of Curve governance are  gauge weight votes . Curve token emissions are created in a way that allows  veCRV holders to choose how future emissions are allocated . Liquidity pools on Curve can be added to the GaugeController via a successfully passed DAO vote, making them eligible to receive CRV token emissions. The gauge weights determine how much CRV each pool receives. Every  Thursday at 00:00 UTC , the updated gauge weights are applied. More info on  Voting  and  Gauge Weights         Locking Information    When a user locks their CRV tokens for voting, they will receive veCRV based on the lock duration and the amount locked. Locking is  not reversible  and veCRV tokens are  non-transferable . If a user decides to vote-lock their CRV tokens, they will only be able to  reclaim the CRV tokens after the lock duration has ended .   Additionally, a user  cannot have multiple locks with different expiry dates . However, a lock  can be extended , or  additional CRV can be added  to it  at any time .   CRV to veCRV formula    When locking CRV to veCRV you are rewarded with an amount of veCRV based on how long you lock, the minimum time is 1 week, the maximum time is 4 years:   \\[ \\text{veCRV} = \\frac{\\text{CRV} \\times \\text{lockTime}}{4 \\text{ years}} \\]   The maximum duration of a lock is 4 years, users cannot lock for longer periods to keep the 1 CRV: 1 veCRV ratio, they must instead continue extending their lock. Users can withdraw their CRV at any time after their veCRV has decayed to 0 (lock time has expired).   veCRV decay    The amount of veCRV a user has will decay over time as their unlock date draws closer. The  lockTime  parameter in the equation above should more aptly be called  lockTimeLeft  as a user's veCRV is constantly recalculated. There are two ways a user can change their lock. They can add to their lock or they can extend their lock. What happens in both situations and how it affects their veCRV and the decay is shown in the charts below.   Extending Locks    Extending locks means increasing the time left on a lock. In the above example if Alice locked 100 CRV for 4 years, after 3 years she would only have 25 veCRV left as her lock time is now 1 year. If she extended her lock to be 4 years again after these 3 years, she would again have 100 veCRV:     Adding CRV to Locks    Adding CRV to locks means the unlock date will remain the same, but more CRV will be locked, meaning more veCRV. If Alice locked 100 CRV for 4 years, but after 2 years added 200 CRV to her lock, she would have 150 veCRV (300 CRV total locked for 2 years). This veCRV would continue to decay to 0 over the next 2 years:       External veCRV Incentives    External marketplaces (out of Curve's purview) have been created to pay for users to vote for specific swap pools/lending markets and receive rewards in return. Curve does not condone or condemn such marketplaces or behavior. It is within the users' rights to use these marketplaces as they wish.   These incentives can be very lucrative and can be multiples of the platform fees earned by veCRV weekly.   These incentives work in the following way:     A project wants liquidity for their token in a swap pool on Curve   The project puts up a incentive for users to vote for the swap pool in the weekly gauge vote. This incentive can be of any amount in any token, e.g., $100k in ETH.     If users vote for the pool, they receive a portion of the incentive based on how much veCRV they have, and how much voted for the pool total.    e.g., 2 users vote for the pool Alice and Bob. Alice has 100k veCRV, Bob has 900k veCRV. The total which voted for the pool was 1M. The $100k ETH get split between Alice and Bob based on their veCRV, so Alice gets $10k in ETH, Bob gets $90k in ETH.       External CRV Liquid Lockers    CRV liquid lockers are products outside of the Curve platform. Some projects have created ways of locking 1 CRV for 1 veCRV forever and giving the user another token in return, e.g., tokenCRV (this token doesn't exist, it was just created for this example). Most of these tokens like tokenCRV don't have all of the benefits of normal veCRV. Also, as all the designs revolve around locking forever, there is no way of getting deposited CRV out of their systems. The user must trade their tokenCRV back to normal CRV on the open market. These tokens are always worth less than 1 CRV.    These tokens are risky, the only way to guarantee being able to withdraw the same amount of CRV as is deposited is to lock through the  Official Curve Locker UI .
