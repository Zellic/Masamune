Along with the pROOK token, USDC will also be received at a rate specified by the exchangeRate value. The ROOK token will effectively be pegged to a specific number of USDC tokens during Phase 1. There are some ROOK holders that are excluded from participating in this redemption process according to the governance proposal, but there is no logic in the exchangeROOK.sol contract to prevent these parties from interacting with the contract. This could result in the draining of USDC held in the contract by these excluded parties, which would effectively cause a bank run on the exchangeROOK.sol contract because some ROOK holders will not be able to receive their promised USDC at the set exchange rate. However, it should be noted that the evidence of these acts would be visible on-chain and there is a level of established trust between the ROOK holders which allowed the current governance proposal to be agreed on. Another scenario that would have a negative impact for ROOK holders would involve the Incubator DAO multisig withdrawing ROOK from exchangeROOK.sol using withdrawAssets() to take all the USDC from this contract before other ROOK holders can redeem their tokens. By depositing ROOK into exchangeROOK.sol to get USDC, then using withdrawAssets() to withdraw the ROOK, then depositing ROOK into exchangeROOK.sol ad infinitum, the USDC would get drained from exchangeROOK.sol. This would also effectively cause a bank run on the exchangeROOK.sol contract because some ROOK holders will not be able to receive their promised USDC at the set exchange rate. An alternative approach for the Incubator DAO multisig to gain value is to withdraw ROOK from exchangeROOK.sol using withdrawAssets(), then to swap the ROOK tokens in a liquidity pool before the ROOK token has no value. While the liquidity pool would be imbalanced and be arbitraged due to the set exchangeRate value in exchangeROOK.sol, the multisig could once again take any new ROOK tokens deposited into exchangeROOK.sol and swap it into a liquidity pool again until the exchangeROOK.sol holds no more USDC.",

Because this is a public function, other users or protocols may assume the function does account for all forms of value held by the strategy, which is an incorrect assumption. Instead, after rewards are claimed by the strategy and are converted into want tokens, the total assets of this strategy will suddenly increase. The amount of this sudden increase could vary depending on how often the rewards are redeemed from the staking pool and how often they are swapped for want. Beyond the inclusion of rewards in the profit and asset values, without guarantees around when the ySwap process will happen, it is possible that the strategy may hold the reward tokens in the form of STG or eTokens for some time.

The eToken is OP, the Optimism token. It is a standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 token rather than the custom StarGate token that is not a simple OpenZeppelin ERC20. ii) The LPStakingTime contract on Optimism uses block.timestamp instead of block.number because this is one of the known differences in Optimism. iii) Some functions in LPStakingTime are external while the same function in LPStaking is public.",

Since function selectors are 4 bytes long, it is feasible to mine a function signature that matches one of the functions in the TokenizedStrategy.sol contract. A bad actor can then hide such a function in the strategy implementation that will be unintentionally called while trying to access the \"real\" function.

It is possible that the voting logic, which is not within the scope of these solidity contracts, may not properly consider this edge case. This edge case can be solved by adding a check in all functions that modify the until state variable, including _delegate() and increaseDelegationDuration(), to validate require(until > block.timestamp). An exception could be made for an until value of zero, resulting in a require statement that looks like require(_until > block.timestamp || _until == 0).

Note that some of the math in these calculations could be moved to an off-chain voting strategy for gas savings Voting for a proposal with veYFI is allowed as soon as the veYFI is locked. Because there is potential for gamification in increasing veYFI stake shortly before key votes, protocols like Convex have implemented a minimum locking duration of several weeks before a token holder can vote, which is implemented in their VotingEligibility.sol contract. Some open and unanswered questions include: Who is allowed to create proposals on snapshot.org? How are the results of each snapshot vote converted to on-chain rewards? Is this automated? Will all vaults receive a gauge that can be voted for on snapshot.org, even those holding very little value? If so, this could lead to gamification of deprecated or old vaults. Is there a maximum allocation a gauge can receive? Is there minimum quorum for governance votes?

Importantly, the Swapper also creates a price limit and adds this as parameter in its call to the Uniswap V3 Router. The problem in this case combines two related truths: safeApprove requires that the previous allowance be completely spent or that it is called with a 0 value. Under any other circumstance it will revert. There is a non-zero chance that the call to the Uniswap V3 Router will not consume the entire allowance set by the call to safeApprove. Uniswap V3 Router's exactInputSingle function, which is what was called by the Swapper, calls exactInputInternal which itself calls swap directly on the pool with the provided parameters. As mentioned earlier, a price limit was included among these parameters. The swap function in Uniswap V3 then swaps in steps until it either has used the entire amountIn or it hits the price limit specified.

These amounts are eventually forwarded to the call to collectFees() in the FeeSplitter.sol contract. The third and fourth arguments are amountTokenOut and amountTokenIn, amountTokenOut should correspond to the \"token out\" (USDC) while amountTokenIn should correspond to the \"token in\" (ETH). The order here is important because FeeSplitter.sol use amountTokenOut as transfer amount for USDC. However, claimAndDistributeFees() ignores this order and simply sends amountCollected0 as amountTokenOut and amountCollected1 as amountTokenIn. This will work on Ethereum mainnet as the address of USDC is lower than the address of WETH, meaning token0 is \"token out\", but will fail on Optimism where the address of USDC is greater than the address of WETH. The following test simulates an scenario where token0 is WETH and token1 is USDC by forking Optimism.

The main issue is that if the call to increaseLiquidity() fails then the catch block will simply return from the function, which means the call to claimAndDistributeFees() will succeed. However, funds from fees have been already claimed but won't be sent to the FeeSplitter.sol contract. Additionally, this issue can be exploited by a bad actor using EIP-150 and the \"rule of 1/64th\". A bad actor can carefully choose the gas limit to make the call to increaseLiquidity() fail due out of gas, while still saving some gas in the main context to continue execution. The call to increaseLiquidity() will revert due to gas limits, and the catch block will be executed thanks to the saved gas. The following test reproduces the issue. We set up the liquidity and fees, and mock the call to increaseLiquidity() to make it revert. The fees will never reach the FeeSplitter.sol and will be stuck in Exit10.sol. Note: the following test requires a newer version of the Forge Standard Library in order to use vm.mockCallRevert(). It can be installed by executing forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit. function test_Exit10_claimAndDistributeFees_LossOfFeesIfIncreaseLiquidityReverts() public { // Generate liquidity and fees _bootstrapLock(10_000e6, 1 ether); _skipBootstrap(); _createBond(100_000e6, 10 ether); _generateFees(address(token0), address(token1), 1000e6); // Assume call to nonfungiblePositionManager.increaseLiquidity reverts vm.mockCallRevert( nonfungiblePositionManager, abi.encodeWithSelector(INPM.increaseLiquidity.selector), \"\" ); // Call function exit10.claimAndDistributeFees(); // FeeSplitter is empty uint256 feesClaimed0 = token0.balanceOf(feeSplitter); uint256 feesClaimed1 = token1.balanceOf(feeSplitter); assertEq(feesClaimed0, 0); assertEq(feesClaimed1, 0); // Fees are stuck in exit10 contract assertGt(token0.balanceOf(address(exit10)), 0); assertGt(token1.balanceOf(address(exit10)), 0); } In this other test we demonstrate the griefing scenario. Even if the call to increaseLiquidity() would succeed, a bad actor can arbitrarily exercise the issue by choosing a gas limit such that the call reverts due out of gas. The entire call to claimAndDistributeFees takes about ~360k units of gas, before calling increaseLiquidity() the gas cost is a bit more than 150k and the call to increaseLiquidity() itself takes a bit more than 50k gas. By choosing 200k units of gas we can get to point of calling increaseLiquidity(), but make this call fail due to out of gas since the forwarded gas will be less than 50k. function test_Exit10_claimAndDistributeFees_IntentionalRevert() public { // Generate liquidity and fees _bootstrapLock(10_000e6, 1 ether); _skipBootstrap(); _createBond(100_000e6, 10 ether); _generateFees(address(token0), address(token1), 1000e6); // Call function and supply a gas limit such that the call to \"increaseLiquidity()\" reverts due to OOG. // The function still continues execution since EIP150 will save 1/64 of available gas, enough to // execute the return in the catch clause. exit10.claimAndDistributeFees{gas: 200_000}(); // FeeSplitter is empty uint256 feesClaimed0 = token0.balanceOf(feeSplitter); uint256 feesClaimed1 = token1.balanceOf(feeSplitter); assertEq(feesClaimed0, 0); assertEq(feesClaimed1, 0); // Fees are stuck in exit10 contract assertGt(token0.balanceOf(address(exit10)), 0); assertGt(token1.balanceOf(address(exit10)), 0); }",

We can do some math to check what ETH prices this corresponds to. // Step 1. calculate 1.0001^tickValue // Step 2. multiply by 10^-12 because of the USDC/WETH decimals conversion // Step 3. invert the value because of the order of WETH and USDC addresses 1 / ((1.0001**184210) * (10 ** -12)) = 10006.019136330182 1 / ((1.0001**214170) * (10 ** -12)) = 500.24195658614434 The chosen tick value that is used for the lower tick corresponds to a price of roughly $10006, which means that if the price of ETH only reaches $10005 before dropping below $10k, the exit10() function cannot be called. A tick value of 184216 or relying on slot0.sqrtPriceX96 instead of slot0.tick would be more precise, but using one of these values would then break the stated goal of holding only USDC when ETH arrives ta $10k because liquidity can only be removed at ticket intervals of 10 ticks. In summary, the protocol has 2 conflicting goals that are slightly mismatched: triggering exit10() when the price of ETH rises above $10k and holding only USDC at the same time that exit10() is called. One possible improvement for price data that would also protect against the situation of a USDC depeg event causing the price of ETH to appear to rise above $10k is to use Chainlink or another decentralized oracle solution for price data. Even if Chainlink is not the primary source of price data, it would be a useful secondary data source to validate that the Uniswap TWAP price is correct and that the price of ETH has indeed reached above 10k to allow exit10() to be called.",

Looking at the Uniswap v3 NatSpec for the underlying NonfungiblePositionManager.collect(), the arguments are described as indicating the maximum amount of tokens to collect, and the return values from collect() indicate the actual value that is returned by the function. One example of this assumption is in bootstrapLock(). amountRemoved0 and amountRemoved1 are passed to _collect() as arguments and then are subtracted from amountAdded0 and amountAdded1.

        "body": "The Exit10 protocol is designed to be immutable, with renounceOwnership() calls in NFT.sol and FeeSplitter.sol. This immutability and the lack of emergency functions could result in locked funds due to uncontrollable external events. The funds that are locked until Exit10.exit10() is called include bootstrap funds, STO, and EXIT, which can only be withdrawn with bootstrapClaim(), stoClaim(), exitClaim(). Uniswap fees are currently passed on to liquidity providers. The Uniswap DAO has long discussed the idea of turning on the fee switch in order to direct some of these fees to Uniswap token holders. This change could substantially impact the fees earned by liquidity providers and may therefore change the assumptions in the Exit10 protocol. A similar result could happen if other events, such as a Uniswap hack or a better AMM, causes the ETH-USDC pool to generate substantially lower fees than estimated. Regardless of what actually happens, the assumption that the underlying Uniswap LP positions will generate fees when held in Exit10 depends on external factors not under control of the protocol. If these assumptions change, it may be useful to allow for emergency withdrawal of funds even before ETH reaches 10k. Another edge case that may occur is if ETH never reaches 10k. While this is a very pessimistic case, external factors like new laws banning certain cryptocurrencies, hacks, hard forks, or other factors could impact the price of ETH and when it might reach 10k. If the price of ETH does not reach 10k before the hardcoded deadline timestamp, which is in the year 2286, the funds will be locked. Another edge case is if a USDC depeg event happens. This could cause the price of ETH in the Uniswap pool to appear to rise above 10k, but in actuality the price of ETH may only be at a lower value such as $8000. A final edge case is that one of the Uniswap contracts behind a proxy, such as the Uniswap v3 Router, may undergo a change that is not backwards compatible. While this is unlikely to happen, a security vulnerability or unexpected DAO vote could cause this to happen.",

This calculation is similar to how ERC4626 asset  share conversion happens in functions such as convertToShares() and convertToAssets(). The second step is to modify the value of the user's claimable rewards if the total claimed rewards (including the amount that is claimed in the active transaction) exceeds the total supply of rewards that exist. The fact that this second step exists implies that the protocol could encounter a situation where the outstanding rewards exceed the rewards that the protocol can afford to payout, which means that at least one user owed rewards will not receive their full amount of rewards. The way the logic works could lead to a bank run scenario, where user(s) who are late to redeem their rewards don't receive the full value of their rewards. While it is not clear under what circumstance this line of logic would be needed, a better design is one like ERC4626 that manages the rounding up or down appropriately and never reaches a bank run type scenario where some users do not receive the expected amount of value due to rounding error accumulation.",

        "body": "During bootstrap, different contracts need to be created separately by the deployer of the protocol before they are put together in their final configuration. During this period of time, the deployer is the owner of these contracts that are later transferred to the Exi10.sol contract. BLP, STO, BOOT and EXIT tokens used in the protocol are created during the initialization. As these contracts grant the owner the ability to arbitrarily mint tokens, a malicious deployer can mint any number of tokens they want before transferring control to the main contract. Another example attack would be to backdoor the Masterchef.sol or MasterchefExit.sol contracts by configuring another pool with a fake token, which can then be used to steal rewards.",

The value type(uint256).max does not accurately represent the maximum value that can be deposited into the vault when some ERC4626 tokens have already been minted. This is because the vault normally can mint a maximum of type(uint256).max, otherwise the totalSupply state variable will overflow and cause a revert, so the existing token supply should be subtracted. The same is true for aTokens, which should have the existing supply excluded. EIP4626 defines this requirement for maxMint(): MUST return the maximum amount of shares mint would allow to be deposited to receiver and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary). The output of maxDeposit() cannot be passed into withdraw() without a revert, which does not satisfy this ERC4626 requirement. A more accurate return value for maxDeposit() in Aave V2 and Aave V3 is: return type(uint256).max - aToken.totalSupply(); The totalSupply value limitation of the ERC4626 vault can be ignored because the totalSupply of the vault will always be less than or equal to aToken.totalSupply(), so the aToken totalSupply is the limiting factor. The same issue is relevant for maxMint(), but the return value of maxMint() should be in units of shares instead of assets because the ERC4626 mint() function takes a shares value as input. The more accurate return value for maxMint() in Aave V2 and Aave V3 is therefore: return convertToShares(type(uint256).max - aToken.totalSupply()); This issue is present in the Compound ERC4626 wrapper as well.

The swapper repo also lacks fee-on-transfer support. This is because the tokenAmountIn value used in the safeTransferFrom() call is assumed to equal the value held by the Swapper.sol contract after the transfer takes place.

The decoupling of the off-chain price oracle with the on-chain swap introduces a chance that the swap is executed at a different price that the price oracle expected.

The following (abridged) call sequence occurs whenever updateState() is performed: ReserveLogic.updateState() -> ReserveLogic._mintToTreasury() -> AToken.mintToTreasury() -> AToken._mint(): The AToken functions are below: function mintToTreasury(uint256 amount, uint256 index) external override onlyLendingPool { if (amount == 0) { return; } // get tranche admin's fee address from configurator address treasury = ILendingPoolConfigurator(_lendingPoolConfigurator).trancheAdminTreasuryAddresses(_tranche); _mint(treasury, amount.rayDiv(index)); ... } function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual { require(account != address(0), \"ERC20: mint to the zero address\"); ... } The require statement in _mint() will cause the state update to revert if the recipient address is 0x0, preventing the protocol from functioning. Note that a global admin can recover the tranche from this state by setting the tranche's treasury address to a valid address (and likely removing the tranche admin). However, this is a manual process and requires the global admin to be aware of the issue and take action. To reproduce this issue, modify helpers/contract-deployment.ts to set treasuryAddress to \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" at L237 and L623.

For the Curve pools that don't implement claim_admin_fees() (example: DAI/USDC/USDT pool), withdraw_admin_fees() on owner (example: DAI/USDC/USDT pool's owner) is called. The correct function signature is withdraw_admin_fees(_pool: address). So it will always return false. Hence, if the call goes to the pool owner, it always reverts. This call also puts a lock on the owner contract instead of the pool because DAI/USDC/USDT pool doesn't have a lock on withdraw_admin_fees(). However, this pool is safe from this reentrancy attack as it doesn't use native token. Curve pools with native token have this reentrancy lock (example: ETH/stETH pool), however, older pools may not have this lock or this lock can be missed in error.",

Some other cases to consider are: The argument could be made that no user would want to lose 15% of their assets to get extra votes. This would depend on the bribe market and other factors, but there is also a way for the user to recapture some of their \"lost\" 15%. If a user has X amount of assets staked in the vault, 10% of the total amount could be used for this cross-chain double voting while the other 90% of the assets reclaim some of the \"lost\" 15% because the 15% fee is distributed among the stakers in the vault. To take this to the next level, a user who knows they will be performing an instant withdrawal can borrow GET at a certain interest rate, stake it, take the 15% instant withdrawal fee hit, and later withdraw the borrowed GET potentially at a profit before returning it to the borrower. Some modeling or linear programming is necessary to determine exactly when recapturing the 15% fee is profitable, especially in the scenario involving borrowed GET, which will not be examined further here. If a snapshot of user assets at a specific block is used to determine votes held by each address, the question is how to synchronize this point in time across chains. It is unlikely such a process would be exact, given that mining a block is not an instant process. If there is a different in snapshot times between Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, it may enable time for assets to be bridged across chains to enable this double voting. The exact plans around how this would work were not outlined in the smart contract and are not in scope of this review, but should be considered.",

With a 1 day wait, it will require 14 times the capital of the other user to issue 0 shares // this is because the vesting schedule follows a linear issuance mechanism over the course of 14 days vm.startPrank(bob); asset.transfer(address(vault), 14 ether + 1); // call the update vesting schedule and wait 1 day for issuance rate to increase vault.updateVestingSchedule(); vm.warp(afterWithdrawalPenalties + (1 days)); // demonstrate that a user who wishes to deposit 1 ether will now be minted 0 shares console.log(\"1 ether deposit after donation attack yields _%s_ shares.\", vault.previewDeposit(1 ether)); }",

The latter is what is normally called in LockedRevenueDistributionToken (1, 2, 3) except for in cancelWithdrawalRequest(). The purpose of line 137 is to burn any excess shares beyond what is returned to the staker cancelling their withdrawal request, because in this case the staker will receive the same value of shares (priced in underlying assets) as when they deposited, but this may be a lesser number of shares than they submitted a withdrawal request for. Phrased another way, the accrued value that the shares gained while the contract held the shares is returned to the vault to be shared among shareholders. When the value in the vault has changed, the value of each share should change by updating freeAssets and issuanceRate. But freeAssets and issuanceRate are not updated when _burn() with two function arguments is called. So after cancelWithdrawalRequest() is called, freeAssets and issuanceRate may not be accurate. Specifically, freeAssets could be overinflated by convertToAssets(burnShares_). And if the _burn happens after vestingPeriodFinish, the issuanceRate will not be updated to zero, meaning the return value of totalAssets() would not be accurate.",

        "body": "There are two closely related issues here: updateVestingSchedule() can be called any time within 24 hours of vestingPeriodFinish. The optimal strategy for calling updateVestingSchedule() from the perspective of a staker who will withdraw from the vault if the yield is any lower is to 1. call updateVestingSchedule() as soon as possible if issuanceRate will increase from its current value (the rate of rewards distribution increases) or 2. delay calling updateVestingSchedule() until vestingPeriodFinish if issuanceRate will decrease. The issue here is that by delaying the updateVestingSchedule() call, the function may not be called until after vestingPeriodFinish. It may be even further delayed if gas is very high and the staker(s) running bots to automatically call the function determine that the \"lost yield\" from the time where issuanceRate is zero is less than the gas cost of calling vestingPeriodFinish. This is possible because the staker(s) running bots may not have a large number of vault shares. issuanceRate can only be changed in updateVestingSchedule() except when block.timestamp > vestingPeriodFinish. When block.timestamp > vestingPeriodFinish, issuanceRate can be set to zero when the _burn() or _mint() RevenueDistributionToken functions are called. This could be done accidentally, with a normal user wishing to stake into the vault who unknowingly sets issuanceRate to zero while staking their GET. Even if issuanceRate is non-zero, rewards will not be distributed after vestingPeriodFinish due to the math in totalAssets(). Any time that vestingPeriodFinish is less than the current block.timestamp is a zero yield scenario for stakers. In short, an issuanceRate of zero is not good for stakers, but there is a question of who will call updateVestingSchedule() and when they will call it. Competing incentives and a lack of integration with a keeper system like Gelato may result in non-ideal scenarios for all stakers.",

A receiver could withdraw more tokens than they should have access to with these steps: The payer deposits X number of fee-on-transfer tokens into the LlamaPayV2Payer contract The internal balance thinks the contract holds X tokens, but actually the contract holds X - tokenFee tokens The contract accounting does not consider the fee involved for fee-on-transfer tokens. If the receiver is eligible to withdraw the X amount of tokens, they can only withdraw X - tokenFee tokens because this is the amount held by the contract. If fee-on-transfer tokens are permitted, the accounting should only permit a withdrawal of X - tokenFee. The payer deposits Y number of fee-on-transfer tokens into the LlamaPayV2Payer contract. If X - tokenFee + Y - tokenFee > X, then the receiver can now withdraw the X amount of tokens because the contract holds enough tokens to allow this withdrawal. If fee-on-transfer tokens are permitted, the accounting should only permit a withdrawal of X - tokenFee, but with the current code, the receiver with withdraw X tokens. Likewise, if a rebasing token is used and the balanceOf token amount in the contract is a function of time, the tokens[_token].balance value is not increased or decreased outside of deposit or withdraw events and therefore the internal accounting may underestimate the tokens held by the contract. This latter case could lock funds in the contract, for example: The payer deposits X number of rebasing tokens into the LlamaPayV2Payer contract Over time, the X rebasing tokens grow to 1.25 * X tokens Once the stream ends and the receiver can withdraw the full token balance, the internal account balance still assumes the contract holds only X tokens, so only X tokens and not 1.25 * X tokens can be withdrawn.",

        "html_url": "https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/05-2023-Sonne",
        "body": "In summary, the collateral limits set by Sonne are unusually high in certain markets. Additionally, the overall amount of borrowed assets in Sonne compared to the total assets deposited is also very high. The combination of these factors indicates that Sonne is at risk of collecting bad debt and may not be in a position to pay off this bad debt, which could permanently impact the protocol's reputation. For a first data point, Sonne collateral parameters can be compared to Compound Finance v2, Aave v2 Ethereum, and Aave v3 Optimism market parameters. The table below shows the collateral and reserve parameters for the different underlying assets. | TOKEN | Sonne Collateral Factor | Compound Collateral Factor | Aave v2 Collateral Factor | Aave v3 Optimism Collateral Factor | Sonne Reserve Factor | Compound Reserve Factor | Aave v2 Reserve Factor | Aave v3 Optimism Reserve Factor | | ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | | OP | 65% | | | 30.00% | 20% | | | | | USDC | 90% | 85.50% | 80.00% | 80.00% | 10% | 7.50% | 10.00% | 10.00% | | USDT | 90% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 75.00% | 10% | 7.50% | 10.00% | 10.00% | | DAI | 90% | 83.50% | 75.00% | 78.00% | 10% | 15.00% | 10.00% | 10.00% | | sUSD | 60% | | 0.00% | 60.00% | 20% | | 20.00% | | | wETH | 75% | 82.50% | 82.50% | 80.00% | 15% | 20.00% | 15.00% | 15.00% | | SNX | 45% | | 46.00% | | 27% | | 35.00% | | | wBTC | 70% | 70.00% | 72.00% | 73.00% | 20% | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% | | LUSD | 60% | | 0.00% | 0.00% | 20% | | 10.00% | 10.00% | | wstETH | 60% | | 72.00% | 70.00% | 18% | | | 15.00% | Some of the most obvious cases where the Sonne choices differ from other protocols include: 90% USDT collateral factor (compared to 0%) 60% sUSD and LUSD collateral factors (compared to 0%) 75% WETH collateral factor (compared to 80%-82.5%) Aave and Compound have undergone extensive risk analysis as evidenced by their dashboards on Gauntlet's website (1, 2), Gauntlet risk assessment reports (1, 2), and regular governance proposals that modify the risk parameters according to market conditions (1, 2). Aave even disabled borrowing on many tokens in AIP-125 in Nov 2022 after an attack on the protocol caused an accumulation of bad debt. Some of the tokens that had borrowing disabled, including SNX (which exists on Sonne), have not yet reenabled borrowing. While Euler Finance decided to allow borrowing against USDT collateral, it is unclear if Euler Finance has undergone the same level of extensive risk modelling that Compound and Aave have. Comptroller has a hardcoded 90% collateralization factor limit, and because the liquidationIncentiveMantissa is 108%, this means that there is less than a 3% margin in price movement (100% - (108% * 90%) = 2.8%) for some markets before a partial liquidation of a position will push the entire position towards liquidation, as outlined by the \"Counterproductive Incentives\" high finding in this OpenZeppelin report. A second data point can be found by comparing the amount of assets lent and borrowed between different lending protocols. A specific focus was placed on comparing Sonne with other Compound forks (Venus, Tectonic, Benqi, Flux) for a more equal comparison. Note that Venus also has a Gauntlet dashboard. The results below show that Sonne is allowing a much higher amount of borrowing than other lending protocols, which means Sonne is at higher risk of accumulating bad debt than other lending protocols. The reason behind such high borrowing might be the added SONNE token incentives, but the specific borrowing interest rate curves may be another reason behind such high borrowing. | Protocol | Total assets ($M) | Borrowed ($M) | Borrowed percentage | | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | | Sonne | 85 | 56 | 65.90% | | Compound v2 | 1770 | 539 | 30.50% | | Aave v2 Ethereum | 5130 | 1670 | 32.60% | | Aave v3 Optimism | 94 | 35 | 37.20% | | Venus | 1219 | 430 | 35.20% | | Tectonic | 194 | 69 | 35.60% | | Benqi | 151 | 36 | 23.80% | | Flux | 60 | 23 | 38.00% | A final data point that would be helpful to understand the risk for the Sonne protocol is a dashboard that shows liquidations or bad debt in Sonne. Sonne is not listed in the Risk DAO bad debt dashboard, but working with this team to add Sonne would be a good step forward. Creating a Dune dashboard for liquidations and accounts at risk of liquidation would also help. The very high borrowing on Sonne relative to underlying collateral indicates that users are taking higher risk positions in the protocol than other lending protocols. Monitoring should be in place to understand if bad debt is accumulating, as it did in Aave in November 2022, so that governance action can be taken to adjust the protocol parameters as needed. The combination of the above factors and the lack of any borrow cap means that the risk of a bank run on Sonne is higher than protocols with less risky parameters. There are at least two different ways that a bank run could happen. One is the case where a market is at a high utilization rate, say near 90% utilization like the soOP market currently is. This means that if a whale who has deposited into the soOP pool plans to withdraw 10% of the total supplied assets, the soOP market will reach 100% utilization ratio. When a market is at 100% utilization ratio, there are no more assets that can be withdrawn from the market, because the market physically does not hold any of these assets. This means that some users will not be able to withdraw their assets in this case. The second scenario where a bank run could happen is if bad debt accumulates in the market. The early users to withdraw will be able to withdraw their funds without any problem, but the late depositors will not. The result is that the late or last users to withdraw their assets will receive 100% of the impact of bad debt accumulation.",

There is no way to trust that the EOA is going to act as expected, and without context there is no way to determine that this EOA will not end up rugging depositors of their rewards. Fortunately, in the case of uSONNE and sSONNE, the 0x201ECB1C439F92aFd5df5d399e195F73b01bB0F3 EOA does not have access to the underlying SONNE tokens deposited into the staking contracts, and only has control over future rewards that SONNE generates. But using an EOA for key operations increases the risk of loss of funds due to private key exposure. A multisig would mitigate the risk of this single point of failure.",

        "body": "The Hundred Finance hack was largely caused by an empty WBTC market. The other requirements for this attack vector are that the market has a non-zero collateral factor (to allow borrowing against this token as collateral) and a totalSupply of the cToken of zero. The result of this is a scenario similar to ERC4626 share price manipulation for the first deposit, with a large donation to skew share price. There is no evidence that Sonne has a clear and consistent mitigation to this attack vector. One of the more recently created Sonne markets, sowstETH, had a 1 day period between the creation of the market on February 19 and the first deposit on February 20. The same pattern is seen in the soLUSD and soWBTC markets, with the soLUSD market created on February 2 and the first deposit on February 3 and the soWBTC market created on December 3 and the first deposit on December 4. The markets were initialized with a non-zero collateral factor, but the collateral factor was raised above 0 before the first deposit in all three of these cases, meaning there was a point in time when the protocol was likely vulnerable to the same attack as Hundred Finance. For example: soWBTC market is deployed at 0x33865E09A572d4F1CC4d75Afc9ABcc5D3d4d867D. soWBTC market was deployed in block 45086893.

Before: cast call 0x33865E09A572d4F1CC4d75Afc9ABcc5D3d4d867D \"totalSupply()\" --block 45448744 --rpc-url https://mainnet.optimism.io After: cast call 0x33865E09A572d4F1CC4d75Afc9ABcc5D3d4d867D \"totalSupply()\" --block 45448745 --rpc-url https://mainnet.optimism.io In fact, after doing a search to find when the collateralization factor changed, it is revealed that the collateralization factor was changed in block 45448654.

Some examples are shown below. | cToken | Interest Rate Model Contract | | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | | cUSDC | 0xD8EC56013EA119E7181d231E5048f90fBbe753c0 | | cDAI | 0xFB564da37B41b2F6B6EDcc3e56FbF523bD9F2012 | | cETH | 0xF9583618169920c544Ec89795a346F487cB5a227 | In contrast, Sonne is using the same interest rate model contract for many different tokens. The results for all soTokens are shown below. The interest rate model curve for WETH and OP is the same as the interest rate model for the stablecoins that aim to maintain a peg to USD. | soToken | Interest Rate Model Contract | | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | | soWETH | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soDAI | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soUSDC | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soUSDT | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soOP | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soSUSD | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soLUSD | 0xbbbd75383f6A61d5EB5b43e94E6372Df6F7f13c6 | | soWBTC | 0x3F6fB832279AC7db0B4F92b79cBB8Df03702631e | | sowstETH | 0x3F6fB832279AC7db0B4F92b79cBB8Df03702631e | | soSNX | 0x7320bD5fA56F8a7Ea959a425F0C0b8cAc56F741E | One of the side effects of the Sonne interest rate model choices is that the rate curve is less steep for tokens with more volatile prices. In order to minimize the risk of bad debt, there should be incentives to avoid excessive borrowing of risky assets. Specifically, WETH and OP are using the same interest rate model curve as stablecoins that should remain pegged to USD. Using a curve with less slope for volatile assets means that borrowing that asset is less expensive, and making it cheaper to borrow volatile assets increases the risk of bad debt accumulating. The table below compares Compound cToken parameters to Sonne soTokens. | Token | multiplierPerSecond | jumpMultiplierPerSecond | baseRatePerSecond | | ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | | cUSDC | 1585489599 | 34563673262 | 0 | | soUSDC | 1981861998 | 43283866057 | 0 | | cETH | 7134703196 | 1553779807204 | 634195839 | | soWETH | 1981861998 | 43283866057 | 0 | | cwBTC | 7134703196 | 31709791983 | 634195839 | | sowBTC | 8918378995 | 39637239979 | 634195839 | Not surprisingly, the largest discrepancy is in WETH, because as mentioned above, soWETH is using the same slope parameters as stablecoins. The soWETH multiplierPerSecond slope is 27.7% of the slope value that Compound uses, and the jumpMultiplierPerSecond slope is only 2.8% of the value chosen by Compound. Or for a different comparison, the cWETH slope after the kink is 218 times the slope before the kink. For soWETH, the slope only increases 22 times after the kink. This means that the Compound Finance market is providing a strong disincentive to borrow beyond the kink for the WETH market than Sonne, most likely to reduce the risk of bad debt. If Compound v2 had a market for OP tokens, the same result would almost certainly exist because soOP is using the same interest rate model as stablecoins, just like soWETH. Finally, while it is true that _setInterestRateModel() in the cToken contract can be used to set a new interest rate model contract, the admin that is able to trigger this change is the Timelock Controller at 0x37ff10390f22fabdc2137e428a6e6965960d60b6, which means that a minimum 48 hour delay must take place before the change can be implemented.",

However, Sonne does not properly imitate the WBTC curve from Compound Finance. Consider these example values for a utilization value of 80%. cash: 20000000000000 borrows: 80000000000000 reserves: 0 reserveMantissa: 200000000000000000 Entering these values into getBorrowRate and getSupplyRate in etherscan for intrest rate contract defined in cWBTC, the resulting values are 95129375951 and 60882800608 respectively. After multiplying this rate-per-block by the blocks-per-year value of 2628000, we find the borrow rate is 25% and the supply rate is 16%. Meanwhile, entering these values into etherscan for soWBTC returns 7768899035 for getBorrowRate and 4972095382 for getSupplyRate. After multiplying this rate-per-second by the seconds-per-year value of 31536000, we find the borrow rate is 24.5% and the supply rate is 15.7%. This error may be partially caused by the baseRatePerBlock value chosen for soWBTC. The Compound value for baseRatePerBlock is 9512937595 and the soWBTC value is 9512937595 / 15 = 634195839. However, a soWBTC value assuming 12 second blocks instead of 15 second blocks may improve alignment to Compound Finance's cWBTC curve. Be aware that the Compound UI is inaccurate for the cWBTC curve as detailed in this open issue for the Compound Finance frontend. When hovering over the 80% utilization in the Compound Finance UI, the UI suggests a borrow rate of 24.5% and a supply rate of 18.13%. Therefore, the UI curves do not match the on-chain cWBTC deployment. Additionally, Sonne uses the same value for constant borrowRateMaxMantissa as Compound but in the comment it is stated that borrow rate value is applied per block. This means that the value should be 12 times lower on Optimism. Another Compound fork on Optimism, Hundred Finance, uses the correct value 0.00004e16.",

Compound Finance took action after this event and made significant changes to their borrow cap approach (1, 2). The result is that Compound Finance has a borrow cap set on every market except for USDC, DAI, and USDT. The borrow caps that are set on markets are set to values that are less than the assets supplied. This means that even though the interest rate curve for borrowing could work up to 100% supplied assets, the borrow cap keeps the maximum amount that can be borrowed significantly lower. Aave also has non-zero borrow caps, although Aave v3 on mainnet Ethereum has higher borrow caps for many assets relative to the amount deposited. Although the explanation in the proposal for reducing the borrow caps was \"insolvency risk from liquidation cascades\" and \"risk of high utilization\", setting proper borrow cap values may also provide some protection in cases like the Venus protocol LUNA fallout (Venus is a Compound fork), because a borrow cap below the value of assets deposited to the protocol would prevent all the assets from the protocol from being borrowed if a Chainlink oracle failed.",

        "html_url": "https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/05-2023-Sonne",
        "body": "When comparing Sonne and Compound Finance on-chain data, it is obvious that there is a large difference in the amount of reserves stored in each protocol. In Compound's cUSDC market, the value of totalReserves is over $13 million. These tokens are owned and stored by the cUSDC contract. In comparison, the Sonne soUSDC market has a totalReserves value of under $1000. The reason that soUSDC has such a low totalReserves value is because the reserves are periodically withdrawn by the admin in transactions such as 0xed3ee0eb900779a6c82d474fc12697bb6cc55372960c775a22c42e4931a7d922. The value flow of the reserves in Sonne is as follows: Reserve tokens accumulate in soToken market contract Reserve tokens are withdrawn by EOA admin EOA admin swaps reserve tokens for USDC using Velodrome pool (potentially has 2% slippage) EOA admin swaps USDC for SONNE tokens (potentially 2% slippage, plus the market price is moved because the USDC/Sonne pool has low liquidity) EOA deposits SONNE tokens into sSONNE, where it sits in the sSONNE contract and collect Velodrome rewards At a minimum, storing the value of the reserves tokens in SONNE introduces currency risk. If bad debt accumulates in a token that is not correlated or pegged to SONNE token value, there is a risk that the value of the reserves could drop in USD terms while the bad debt amount increases in USD terms, making it impossible for the Sonne multisig or admins to pay off the debt. For a specific example, if Sonne collects $1000 in bad debt denominated in USDC and has $5000 of reserves value that was converted to SONNE, then if the SONNE token drops in price more than 80% compared to when the USDC was converted to SONNE, the protocol will not have enough reserves to pay off the bad debt. It is generally a good practice for DAOs or protocols to diversify their treasury holdings. If Sonne holds the original underlying assets instead of converting these assets to Sonne, it demonstrates that Sonne holds real value uncorrelated to the SONNE token. The current approach converts these underlying into SONNE with the goal of propping up the SONNE token price by funding the Velodrome USDC/SONNE market, but it reduces the actual value owned by SONNE in non-SONNE tokens. A secondary risk that is introduced with the swapping of reserve funds is the total losses due to the swaps. Sonne may be losing 5% of total reserve value by swapping the underlying reserve tokens into SONNE because the default slippage on Velodrome is 2%. Two swaps in Velodrome means around 4% of value can be lost, and as highlighted in a separate low findings, the SONNE/USDC market has low liquidity and large swaps can move the market price. If SONNE tokens need to converted back to other tokens to pay off debt, then the overall losses due to slippage could be 7% or higher. This means that the reserves collected by the protocol over time does not match the actual value that could pay off bad debt.",

The same applies to shares[]. In fact, because _editRecipientInternal() is always called with shares_ set to balanceOf(account), the shares[] mapping is duplicating exactly what _balances[] already stores. The only reason that Tarot Finance has a totalShares state variable and stores the shares count in recipient.shares (the equivalent of shares[]) in its Distributor contract (the inspiration for Sonne's Distributor) is because the Tarot Finance contract is not an ERC20 and does not have a totalSupply variable or _balances mapping.",

If the threshold is set to a value less than the current utilisation ratio, it can break assumptions about how the protocol should work and prevent tranche deposits or withdrawals.

        "body": "_calculateLockedProfit() is designed to slowly release profits to the GVault depositors. If the releaseTime is surpassed, which is 24 hours, it returns zero, which means no profit is locked. The lockedProfit value is updated when report() in GVault is called by a strategy's runHarvest(). ConvexStrategy's canHarvest(), which indicates when a keeper can call runHarvest(), has a constant MIN_REPORT_DELAY value of 48 hours. This means that if MIN_REPORT_DELAY is the determining factor for when a harvest happens, _calculateLockedProfit() will return zero for roughly half of that minimum time period. During the time that _calculateLockedProfit() returns zero, the profit calculation in PnLFixedRate of totalValue - lastTotal will return zero. This will causes the Senior Tranche to take value from the Junior Tranche to pay the fixed yield of the Senior Tranche. An example of how this could be leveraged to cause a loss for Junior Tranche holders: Depositor deposits 3CRV into the GVault The GVault does not move 3CRV to the strategy until report() is called by a strategy, so the assets may not maximize their yield for some time Depositor deposits their GVault ERC4626 tokens into the Senior Tranche and soon withdraws. The deposit and withdrawal may both be done in a short period (say, 24 hours) while _calculateLockedProfit() is returning zero. This means before report() will not have been called to deposit the loose 3CRV in the GVault to maximize yield, yet the depositor claims their fixed yield from the Senior Tranche at the cost of Junior Tranche depositors, who don't reap the full benefits of the 3CRV deposit into the GVault. If the above actions are performed frequently with large amounts of capital, say twice a week, the Junior Tranche may be less appealing for depositors. This is because the Junior Tranche is willing to pay the Senior Tranche the borrowing cost for leverage, but this cost makes more sense if the Junior Tranche is able to use the 3CRV in the strategy and not when it is sitting idle in the GVault. This scenario would get worse if the tranche had a large utilization ratio, say 10x, because the fee paid to the Senior Tranche would be larger. The flip side of this is that Junior Tranche depositors would be incentivized to withdraw their deposits during the time when _calculateLockedProfit() returns zero for the same reason.",

When the GVault provides this 3CRV to ConvexStrategy to invest, the invest() function makes sure that the liquidity added to the metapool is within proper slippage tolerance. If the Curve pool is imbalanced sufficiently by the added liquidity, it may not return sufficient value and cause invest() to revert due to the slippage exceeding the slippage tolerance. This denial of service would not cost the whale much to sustain the DoS because they could deposit the GVault tokens into the Senior Tranche (at least until the utilization ratio is met) and receive their fixed yield, even though the Junior Tranche is not receiving its yield because the strategy's harvesting mechanism is locked up. In theory this could lead to bankrupting the Junior Tranche if carried out for long enough because the whale's deposit can't be deposited into the metapool to maximize rewards, like the \"leach attack\" described in a separate finding. divest() has a similar slippage check that may also revert under some conditions. Since users cannot control when divest happens, the whale would need to imbalance the pool outside of Gro.

The gains are defined as the difference between all the strategy's assets (loose assets, LP tokens, and rewards) and the strategy's debt, which is a value stored in strategies[strategyAddress].totalDebt in the GVault. A key part of this is that when a strategy reports a loss, the totalDebt of the strategy is reduced to account for the loss, so it is as though the strategy received fewer assets to begin with. The combination of how fees are taken from gains and the goal post for how gains are calculated getting moved on every loss creates a problematic combination. Consider the following series of events: Value of Strategy is $1000 Strategy loses $20 and report() is triggered Strategy gains $20 and report() is triggered (pays vault fee on $20 gains) Strategy loses $20 and report() is triggered Strategy gains $20 and report() is triggered (pays vault fee on $20 gains) The strategy has paid the vault fee twice even though the value in the strategy hasn't changed. It is only the volatility in the strategy's assets that caused the fees to be applied. This penalizes depositors for market volatility instead of penalizing them for withdrawing, which is how the Gro protocol is documented to work today. Note that this specific strategy is built on 3CRV and the Frax Curve metapool, so the value of the LP tokens should only increase and not be subject to such volatility. By deducting fees at the time of profit, there is less value in the vault to compound and grow, which slightly reduces the appeal of the strategy.",

When the Frax metapool was examined at the time of this review, the Curve Finance frontend estimated a 0.03% slippage if withdrawing 1E8 LP tokens, which was over 20% of the total supply of the metapool. Similarly, when estimating the slippage for a deposit of 1E8 CRV tokens, which would increase the existing balance of CRV in the metapool by over 50%, the frontend estimated a 0.06% slippage. Given the size of the slippage with such large deposits or withdrawals, and considering that the default slippage tolerance on the Curve frontend for this Frax metapool is 0.1%, the existing combination of PERCENTAGE_DECIMAL_FACTOR and baseSlippage provides too large of a slippage tolerance.",

This means that if the Junior Tranche protects the Senior Tranche 1-to-1 and there is 100% utilization, no Junior Tranche funds can be withdraw. In the event that all depositors to the Junior Tranche wish to withdraw, there could be a \"bank run\" where the first users to withdrawer receive their funds, but when the utilization ratio hits 100%, no Junior Tranche funds can be withdrawn because they are needed to protect the funds in the Senior Tranche. This behaviour is the norm for tranche structures, but users who have not interacted with such a pool design may not clearly understand the limitations of the system. This could be problematic for users if they have a loan in a protocol like Aave that is about to be liquidated and they cannot withdraw their funds from the Junior Tranche to increase their loan collateralization ratio. A real scenario where this would be incentivized to take place is a \"leach attack\", when the fixed yield on the Senior Tranche exceeds what the underlying vault is capable of producing and the Senior Tranche depositors leach off the Junior Tranche value. If the Senior Tranche promised an absurdly high fixed yield, or if the underlying vault yield drops to a near-zero value, the Senior Tranche depositors would be more incentivized to keep their token in the Senior Tranche to receive the \"impossibly good\" yield, even though the yield the Senior Tranche is receiving is being taken from the token value of the Junior Tranche depositors (because the yield from the vault cannot cover the fixed yield amount). It is true that the tranche owner can set the fixed rate with setRate(), but there may be a delay before this happens (possibly a DAO vote), during which time value could be leached from Junior Tranche depositors and the Junior Tranche depositors would be unable to withdraw because 1. the utilization ratio does not permit it 2. the leaching causes a loss of value in the Junior Tranche which makes the utilization ratio even worse.",

The contract should be updated accordingly. The Ownable import in GToken is redundant because the import of Whitelist.sol includes Ownable already _calcTokenAmount() can remove the _deposit boolean function argument because it is never used for anything useful in the function The NatSpec in CurveOracle uses the term \"yield token\" to mostly refer to 3CRV while FixedTokensCurve NatSpec uses \"yield token\" to mostly refer to GVault shares. Consider terms that more clearly differentiate the tokens. Remove unused _tranche bool function argument from _calcTrancheValue() Remove if (_factor == 0) logic from _calcTrancheValue() because this can never happen based on current contract logic lastDistribution could be uint32 instead of uint64 Consider renaming _calcFees() to _gainSubFees()",

While true, we still recommend mitigating the risk of misuse as a kind of public good. The lowest cost way of reducing this risk is through natspec on the functions with a clear warning to callers of the potential pitfalls. Another potential solution to consider that would greatly eliminate this risk would be by adding the minIn / minOut params to the internal swapIn() swapOut() fns, thereby forcing the caller to intentionally pass 0 if they really did not want slippage protection. This would slightly add to the overall runtime gas profile but the difference would be negligible. It costs much less gas to do this than to, for example, call routerOnly which incurs a cold SLOAD.

        "body": "Rage Trade relies on providing liquidity to the GMX protocol for long exposure to WETH and WBTC. The GMX Vault is where all GMX protocol underlying assets are stored. The GMX vault has a target weight for each underlying asset, but the target weight is not the same as the current weight of the asset in the vault during a specific block. The actual weights of the tokens The Rage Trade rebalancing approach uses the ideal target weight, not the actual current weight of the asset. This means the Rage trade strategy is not actually delta neutral because it assumes an ideal mix of underlying assets when holding GLP and doesn't consider the current underlying assets. To demonstrate the issue, data was taken from the Arbitrum blockchain to plot the exposure that Rage Trade has had to the underlying assets WETH and WBTC since around the time that the delta neutral strategy began receiving funds. The short exposure takes the form of WETH or WBTC borrowed from Aave. To calculate this percentage, the amount of WETH or WBTC borrowed was multiplied by the price of the asset and then divided by the total value of GLP held by the Rage trade strategy. The short exposure does a good job of targeting the 35% and 15% marks for WETH and WBTC respectively. The 35% and 15% marks are the target allocations for the GMX vault to hold of WETH and WBTC. The long exposure takes the form of GLP, which holds roughly 50% stablecoins and 50% WETH and WBTC. The data for the exposure to WETH and WBTC was taken from at stats.gmx.io during the same period as the short position exposure chart. The comparison of the short and long exposure to WETH and WBTC is shown below. As the charts demonstrate, since the deployment of Rage Trade in December 2022, the GMX vault, and therefore GLP, has consistently held more WBTC and less WETH than the GMX vault target weights. But the Rage Trade short positions do not reflect this, and instead use the target weights to determine the ideal short exposure to these assets. In its current form, Rage Trade has held a position of long WBTC and short WETH since it was deployed. Examining the asset exposure in the GMX Vault over the entire duration of GMX's history, it is more apparent how far the asset allocations can stray from the target. The second figure below focuses on the less volatile period of GMX asset allocation in 2022 to provide a closer look at how different the asset allocation is from the 35% WETH and 15% WBTC targets. Since June 2022, the GMX vault has mostly been overweight in WBTC and underweight in WETH, but sometimes it is overweight in both assets. Focusing on more \"extreme\" changes in the asset allocations of the vault, the vault held a total of 39.4% in WETH and WBTC combined on May 26 2022, but that rose to 54% on July 24 2022, less than 2 months later. If this strategy was active at this time, it would have had too large of a short position and too small of a long position. It is true that during this time the value of WETH and WBTC dropped by around 22%, so in actuality these months would have been profitable for this strategy, but a reverse scenario where the assets increased by 22% in value would have left the strategy at a loss. Even if the above scenario where the strategy is weighted in the wrong direction of market movements does not occur, another risk is if the correlation between WETH and WBTC prices change significantly. It's possible there is an implied assumption that WETH and WBTC prices are correlated, so as long as the sum of allocations WETH and WBTC in the GMX vault is roughly 50% of the GMX vault, then the long position should neutralize the short position. But if the WETH/WBTC price correlation changes while they GMX vault allocations are not near the targets, this could be problematic. The chart from CoinGecko shows this ratio over the last two years and demonstrates that it can easily change by 10% or more in a short timespan. In summary, the risk this issue highlights includes: strategy losses from when WETH and WBTC positions are overweighted towards a long position and the prices of these assets drops. The reverse can also happen, where WETH and WBTC positions are underweighted towards a long position and the prices of these assets rises. strategy losses from when WETH and WBTC weights in the GMX vault are not at the target weights and the WETH/WBTC price ratio changes in the wrong direction from how the GMX vault (and therefore the Rage Trade strategy) is weighted.",

        "body": "The junior vault attempts to hold equal long and short positions to maintain a delta neutral position in the market. The reason this is done is to avoid impermanent loss, which is a common problem for liquidity providers. The junior vault holds a short position by borrowing WETH and WBTC from Aave (after depositing USDC to maintain a reasonable health factor). The junior vault holds an equal long position by holding GLP (technically fsGLP, the staked version of GLP) which consists of a basket of underlying assets mostly consistently of WETH, WBTC and stablecoins. There are two small ways in which the Rage Trade delta neutral strategy has bias in its holdings that could create unwanted exposure to certain assets. A consistent bias over the long run can impact yield returns to depositors because impermanent loss may cause losses in the long run. The GLP vault does not hold exactly 50% WETH & WBTC with the remaining 50% in stablecoins. It targets a holding of 1% LINK and 1% UNI, so in reality the targeted exposure is 35% WETH, 15% WBTC, 1% UNI, 1% LINK, and 50% stablecoins. The delta neutral strategy has no short position to cover the long exposure held in UNI or LINK. Although the percentage of UNI and LINK holdings is small, this exposure can result in non-zero impermanent loss over the long run. If there is an assumption that UNI and LINK prices are correlated to WETH and WBTC, then the value of the short positions should be increased to roughly 52% of the GLP value, rather than the currently targeted 50%. LINK is an asset that can be borrowed and shorted on Aave like WETH and WBTC currently are, an approach which would maintain a more precise neutral position. The second bias is that the process that rebalances the junior vault holdings consistently has more long exposure than short. This can be seen on the long timescale where the ratio is targeting 2 (the reason the target ratio is 2 and not 1 is because only 50% of the holdings in the GMX vault are WETH and WBTC) but the actual value is consistently above 2. Zooming in on the shorter timescale, observe the point in time when a rebalance happens in the middle of this plot. While the rebalance brings the ratio closer to 2, it could do better, and this inaccuracy may be due to an inaccuracy in the implementation's math.",

Performing this series of four backrun swaps can still be net profitable even if one of the individual backrun swaps is not. The reason the 3rd backrun swap is not profitable may be because the flashloan fee costs more than the profit of this arb, which reverts here or here, or a similar revert can happen if the router contract funds are used for the arb and the amount received is less than expected. The result is the transaction reverts and OpenMevRouter will miss out on the arb profits if the swaps had been completed even if one individual backrun swap wasn't profitable.",
