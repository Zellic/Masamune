When user A approves the transfer of N tokens to user B, and user A updates the allowance to M using the approve function, user B can deploy the approve transaction in the mempool and take M+N tokens by transferring N tokens just before the second approval with a higher gas price, and transferring M tokens after the second approval.  Impact  In this case, this issue could result in User B stealing User As M tokens.  Remediation  We recommend that the Keep Network team prevent updates between non-zero allowances. The user planning to update the approval from non-zero to non-zero must set the allowance to zero rst. As a result, the user can detect if the allowance was used by the approved user before the new approval.

        "body": "  Location  Keep-Network-Bitcoin-Spv  Synopsis  Issue #192 in the summa-tx/bitcoin-spv repository provides a good summary of the Issue. An attacker can create a valid SPV proof out of a fake transaction. The attacker could use this SPV proof during the deposit ow to trick the Bridge into minting tokens that they could then withdraw.  Impact  If an attacker is able to fake an SPV transaction deposit, then the Bridge could be tricked into minting an unbacked balance of new tokens.  Preconditions  The attacker must successfully brute-force a hash and then use it in an SPV proof. Additionally, the tBTC Bridge v2 must be using a version of bitcoin-spv that does not check for the malformed Merkle proof that this attack uses.  Feasibility  This attack would be quite expensive upfront, requiring an estimated several million USD to carry out \u2014 depending on current market prices. Additionally, the hardware requirements would be substantial, likely requiring state-of-the-art miners capable of brute-forcing the necessary hashes in a reasonable time frame. However, depending on the price of Bitcoin, and as the Keep Network and its average wallet sizes grow, there will be a point where this attack will become protable after the initial costs.  Technical Details  Simple payment verication relies on Merkle proofs created with the previous transactions hash included to verify provenance. The problem is that bitcoin does not differentiate between inner nodes and leaf nodes in these proofs. As a result, a malicious actor can create a transaction with a brute-forced inner node in a Merkle proof that matches the expected values of another arbitrarily selected valid transaction. This requires brute-forcing a total of 72-bits of address space in order to compute the necessary bytes to make the constructed proof match. With this Merkle tree available, the attacker can submit a transaction with an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin to a victim SPV wallet. The transaction would be seen as a valid proof and the tBTC Bridge v2 would trigger a deposit, eventually minting tokens at an equal proportion to the amount in the malicious transaction. The attacker would then trigger a redemption process as soon as possible and retrieve a balance that they never actually owned.  Remediation  We can recommend two mitigations for this issue: A quick solution can be achieved by checking that every 64-bit node in the Merkle proof is not a valid transaction and either discarding it or further validating it with the knowledge that it is suspicious. Another more expensive approach is to send a Merkle proof of  Security Audit Report | tBTC Bridge v2 | Keep Network 29 September 2022 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  10  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   the coinbase transaction, along with the SPV proofs for the transaction, which would add sucient complexity to the address space necessary to brute-force to make this attack infeasible.

This allows extensions to interact with wallet components and force them to behave in insecure and unintended ways.  Impact  The following unexpected behaviors were identied during the course of the audit (non-exhaustive list):  Write Arbitrary Domains to ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS  This allows extensions to embed the wallet in web pages that have not been approved as safe for use. This could result in untrusted domains being able to embed the wallet.  Connect to Arbitrary dApps  Browser extensions can break into the Angular sandbox and enable development mode features on components to connect to arbitrary dApps without user interaction. This would result in an attacker being able to remotely interact with the wallet. In order to approve transactions, the attackers would need to learn the password from the wallet, which can be learned through keylogging or monitoring the clipboard.  Injecting Keyloggers and Clipboard Listeners  This could result in the exposure of passwords and mnemonics.  Security Audit Report | Kukai Wallet | Tezos Foundation 4 March 2022 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Preconditions  A users browser must already be in a post-compromised state by having a malicious extension installed.  Technical Details  Writing Arbitrary Domains to ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS  The ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS (environment.prod.ts) is used as an allow-list for whether a domain is authorized to host an embedded wallet. This array is read-write, which means an attacker can disable the restriction by injecting the following code:  document.getElementsByTagName('app-root')[0].__ngContext__[30].CONSTANTS .ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS.push('*')  Connecting to Arbitrary dApps  The text input in the app-qr-scanner component is removed from the DOM when in a production environment using an ng-if. A malicious extension can disable the production environment variable for this component and dispatch a paste event to the input to initiate a connection to an arbitrary dApp.  root = document.getElementsByTagName('app-root')[0]  qr = root.children[3].children[2].children[0].__ngContext__[13]  qr[8].env.production = false  Full exploit code can be found in Appendix A.

This exposes the wallet to a class of attacks known as UI Redressing attacks (also referred to as Clickjacking), where a malicious website will load the target website in a hidden iframe and get a user to perform actions on the target website without their knowledge through social engineering.  Impact  If an attack is successful, a user could be tricked into sending all their funds to an attacker controlled address.  Feasibility  Connecting the wallet to a dApp or authorizing a transaction would require a level of user interaction that is unlikely to succeed. A user would be required to enter the value of the attacker's address into the fake form, as well as enter their password to verify the transaction. In practice, successfully engineering such a ow would be prohibitively dicult for an attacker to achieve.  Remediation  The Kukai team discussed using Cloudare for delivering the application to users and requested suggestions on appropriate security headers. The X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header, when set to SAME-ORIGIN or DENY, will block all attempts to frame the application. However, this approach will likely break the Kukai wallet embedded functionality.  We recommend using a Content Security Policy (CSP) and setting the frame-ancestors to the pre-approved domains allowed to embed Kukai, as found in the ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS array.  Status  The Kukai team has added a CSP in the HTTP header that restricts the domains that can embed the wallet to only domains approved by the Kukai team. In the development environment, the headers are not loaded by the development web server, so we were not able to conrm the issue has been resolved in the production server version. However, if loaded by the production servers, the presence of the header le will restrict which domains can embed the wallet application.

        "body": "  Synopsis  It is possible to copy the mnemonic seed to the clipboard. The clipboard object is accessible globally and could be monitored by other loaded web pages and browser extensions. This could lead to a leakage of the seed phrase required to control the Kukai wallet.  Impact  The mnemonic seed could be exposed to malicious actors resulting in loss of user control of the Kukai wallet.  Preconditions  A user must have copied the freshly created mnemonic to the clipboard while another tab is running a script to watch the clipboard for mnemonic seed phrases. This script could be from a malicious page, extension, or JavaScript loaded through an advertising network.  Feasibility  Although the attack script is trivial, the complexity of the attack is determined by the delivery mechanism and the timing. However, it is reasonable that an attacker could monitor multiple clipboards (machines) for extended periods of time, and capture mnemonic phrases that are created and copied on these compromised machines using any wallet that enables the clipboard feature.  Technical Details  A mnemonic monitoring script can be created with the following lines of JavaScript:  function handleCB(txt) {  var words = txt.split(/\\s+/);  if (words.length === 12 || words.length === 24) {  alert(txt);  clearInterval(chk_cp);  }  }  chk_cp = setInterval(() => {navigator.clipboard.readText().then(txt => handleCB(txt))}, 5000);  Mitigation  We recommend that the Kukai wallet user guide be updated to provide guidance on security best practices for managing and storing the mnemonic phrase. This includes advisories on the dangers of copying the mnemonic to the clipboard in the application when the seed phrase is generated, which helps users make more informed decisions about the security of their assets.  Security Audit Report | Kukai Wallet | Tezos Foundation 4 March 2022 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  10  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Remediation  The Kukai wallet user guide recommends writing down the seed phrase and not storing it electronically. This is the most secure method of storage. Since users have repeatedly requested a means to save the seed phrase electronically, we recommend the mnemonic phrase be provided as a le download from the application. This option provides users with a more seamless experience while reducing the exposure of the mnemonic phrase, given that the lesystem is generally more secure than the clipboard. This is already possible when downloading the wallet le.  We recommend employing a similar method to download the mnemonic. This would allow users to retrieve their mnemonic without potentially exposing it to monitoring scripts.  Status  The Kukai team has implemented a strong warning to users selecting the mnemonic seed phrase for the purposes of copying it to the clipboard. The warning states the risks of using the clipboard to store the mnemonic. Our team built the wallet and attempted to copy the mnemonic to the clipboard. While copying is still possible, the warning message is clear and explicit and better facilities user decision making and discourages user misuse.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  ",

This behavior in Swift is designed so that  some parts of the memory are not controlled by the developers. In particular, copies of memory can be  created at runtime that are uncontrollable and untrackable. Moreover, the operating system can move and  copy memory without hindrance. As a result, this might allow an attacker to read the private key from  RAM.   Impact   If successful, an attacker is able to access a private key and has full control over the wallet and its funds.   Feasibility   Low. Since locating the private key footprint in the RAM is difficult, it would also be difficult to carry out  such an attack in a real world application. However, this is a general concern that has also been noted in  the  Apple Security Development Checklist .   Mitigation   Since this issue is based on the expected behavior of Swift, we recommend that the development team  research potential mitigation strategies that align with industry best practices.   Status   Since research for a mitigation strategy by the development team drew inconclusive results, our team  suggested adhering to  Apple's Security Development Checklists , specifically as it pertains to the  following:   Scrub (zero) user passwords from memory after validation:  Passwords must be kept in memory for the  minimum amount of time possible and should be written over, not just released, when no longer needed.

Impact   We are not aware of any attack that can be based on this behavior. However, the type  Tez  does not  behave according to the Michelson specifications, outlined in  Michelson: the language of Smart Contracts  in Tezos  and  Michelson Reference , which might lead to various unexpected problems with calculations.    Feasibility   The problem may arise whenever a developer wants to subtract a certain amount of  Tez  from another  Tez  and uses negative  Tez  and addition to achieve that.     Technical Details   Suppose a user has 2.1  Tez  and wants to subtract 1.999999  Tez  from this. The computation is 2.1  Tez  -  1.999999  Tez  = 0.100001  Tez . However, since  init(_ balance: double)  accepts negative  Tez , the  user can execute something like the following:   let tez1 = Tez(2.1)   let tez2 = Tez(-1.999999)   let result = tez1 + tez2   This gives the undefined value  result = 1,-899999  which is not a number. This happens because  tez2 is the non number \u2018-1.-999999.   Remediation   Prevent initialization with negative  Tez . According to the Michelson specifications, the type  Tez  should  only be able to store positive values.

This is equivalent to  Int_32  on 32-bit platforms and  Int_64  on 64-bit platforms.   Impact   Since the TezosKit implementation of both  nat  and  int  is bounded by 32/64 bit signed integers, it is not  possible to send parameters or read storage of those types from/to on-chain Tezos Smart contracts that  exceed the storage capacities of Swifts  Int  type, leading to various boundary errors.

Preconditions  The attacker gains physical control of the browser extension wallet when unlocked and dumps the memory from the browser.  Technical Details  The password is required to unlock the browser extension wallet. Once it has been unlocked, the password is stored in the memory and the seed phrase is decrypted using the password from the vault. The password and seed phrase are then saved in the memory to use later to derive the root key. The password and seed phrase are both stored in cleartext. Once the memory is dumped by the browsers DevTools, they are exposed. The memory dump enncompasses the following steps: open Chrome Developer Tools, select Memory, click Take Snapshot, and then Save. With the downloaded le, run the strings command and, for quick results, grep for a word in the password and seed phrase to view in clear text.  Mitigation  We recommend removing the password from the memory after the browser extension wallet is unlocked. The password is not required after unlocking the browser extension wallet to make transactions. When the password is required again for other operations (e.g. import notes, network change, and others), the password can be re-entered by the user.  In addition, we recommend storing the root key together with the seed phrase in the vault so that when the browser extension wallet key (derived from the root key) is required to sign a transaction, it is read from the decrypted vault and the seed phrase is not required to derive it, which exposes the cleartext seed phrase to the memory. A root key is more dicult to identify in a memory dump than a seed phrase.  Status  The Blank team has decided against requiring that the user re-enter their password when vault unlocks are needed, due to the signicant user experience implications.

Hashed passwords are more dicult to identify than cleartext passwords once memory is leaked, however, they are still vulnerable to brute-force attack on weak passwords (Issue C). For root key derivation, the Blank team has decided against making changes due to other security concerns and are instead adhering to MetaMask's eth-keyring controller approach. We acknowledge that the current resolution has slightly decreased the vulnerability of cleartext passwords in memory and has the minimum impact on the user experience. However, the changes implemented by the Blank team only partially resolve the issue, since the hashed password is still in the memory and the aforementioned brute-force attack of a weak password is still feasible.

Although browser extension wallet users are provided a password strength estimate in the UI, this feature is only informational to encourage users to create secure passwords. However, this bar does not enforce any particular level of password strength and users have the ability to choose insuciently secure passwords.  Preconditions  A machine that the browser extension wallet is installed on is compromised.  Impact  An attacker gains full access to a users account by brute-forcing an insecure password, which may result in total loss of user funds.  Feasibility  Easy. Password attacks are increasingly common. Furthermore, it may be that Blanks anonymous withdrawals feature is an additional incentive to conduct such an attack.  Technical Details  Password entropy is given by the following formula:  \ud835\udc38  =  \ud835\udc3f  *  \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc542(\ud835\udc45)  where:  R - Size of the pool of unique characters from which we build the password (in this case, a-z, A-Z, and 0-9)  L - Password length (i.e. the number of characters in the password; in this case, 8)  An 8-character mixed case password that includes a numeral contains approximately 48 bits of entropy and would take under a day to compromise, at a very conservative rate of 10 billion guesses/second (1 trillion password guesses per second speeds or more are not uncommon, depending on cores and machines used). A dictionary word, prior breached password, or sequential/repeating password would crack nearly instantaneously.  According to zxcvbn documentation, a password should have a minimum of approximately 1e10 bits of entropy to be considered \"safely unguessable\" from an o\ufb04ine attack with user-unique salting but a fast hash function like SHA-1, SHA-256, or MD5.  Mitigation  We recommend increasing the requirement of password entropy and disallowing passwords that are easy to guess.  We recommend following the NIST Guidelines, which are industry standard rules and best practices for handling passwords when building memorized secret authenticators.  Remediation  We recommend using the dropbox/zxcvbn library for a password composition policy intended to prevent the use of passwords obtained from previous breaches, common passwords, and passwords containing repetitive or sequential characters, as recommended by the NIST guidelines.

Part 2: The Blank team brought this issue to our attention, after which we identied the following additional vulnerability:  In the window management method called stateWatch in the BlankProviderController, SIGNING is declared as a watch-state but the state update does nothing while signing a message. This implies that the user is not prompted before signing a message.  Impact  These vulnerabilities are critical as they imply that an external provider can sign any message on behalf of a user without the user explicitly conrming.  Technical Details  Both of these are similar, as they relate to signing an EIP-712 message without user conrmation.

Additionally, if the _beneficiary does exist, the function loops through the vestingScheduleNames array rather than those related to the particular beneciary only.  In the zero address case, a new zero address beneciary is added to the mapping of beneciaries for every vestingScheduleName, if it is the rst time calling with a zero address. Otherwise, it is an unnecessary update of a previously added zero address.  For the non-existing address case, a new beneciary is added to the mapping of beneciaries for every vestingScheduleName with that address if it is the rst time calling with a non-existing address. Otherwise, it is an unnecessary update of a previously added non-existing address.  Additionally, when there is no beneciary for any vestingSchedulesNames[i], it redundantly performs operations, and another beneciary may be added for vestingSchedulesNames[i].  Impact  In the rst two cases, an incorrect event is emitted at the end of the function because it did not actually delete anything but rather added to the mapping. In every case, it results in the further consumption, and eventual loss, of gas.

Synopsis  The above-referenced functions are missing necessary checks and adjustments or execute incorrect adjustments:  1. The addVestingScheduleAllocation function does not check if the contract has enough  unused balance to dedicate to the particular vesting schedule: require(getUnusedAmount() >= _amount). As a result, the amount of balance dedicated to all vesting schedules could exceed the smart contracts balance, rendering the smart contract unable to pay for all vesting schedules;  2. The removeVestingScheduleAllocation function does not check if the schedule has  enough unallocated tokens to deduct from: require(getScheduleUnallocatedAmount(_name) >= _amount). If the amount deducted is more than a particular vesting schedules unallocated amount, the smart contract would lose track of the vestingSchedulesTotalAmount, assuming the amount allocated to beneciaries is less than what it actually is, which may result in it being unable to pay for all vesting schedules;  3. Both functions do not check if a VestingSchedule function with the particular _name  argument exists. In the case of addVestingScheduleAllocation, the operation would pass and a new VestingSchedule would be added to the vestingSchedules mapping, with vestingSchedule.totalAmount = _amount. In the case of removeVestingScheduleAllocation, it would revert due to an unpredicted underow: vestingSchedules[_name].allocatedAmount -= _amount  4. Both functions incorrectly adjust vestingSchedules[_name].allocatedAmount instead of  vestingSchedules[_name].totalAmount. This might lead to the track of the actual vestingSchedule.allocated amount being lost, resulting in incorrect calculations in the functions getScheduleLockedAmount and getScheduleUnallocatedAmount. Consequently, the claimTokens function could behave unexpectedly; and  5. Both functions are missing the necessary adjustments of vestingSchedulesTotalAmount by  the amount increased or decreased: vestingSchedulesTotalAmount += _amount;  vestingSchedulesTotalAmount -= _amount;  In both increase and decrease cases, the vestingSchedulesTotalAmount would indicate an incorrect state of the amount reserved for all vesting schedules, resulting in the getUnusedAmount function incorrectly calculating the remaining balance to be allocated for vesting schedules.

        "title": "Issue A:  Inappropriate Memoization of Function Call Loading a Contract",
        "body": "   Location   /thanos-wallet/src/lib/thanos/contract.ts   Synopsis   The function  loadContract  is memoized, thus it only executes once for a particular set of arguments  and all subsequent calls will return the same value. Since this is a function that returns the details of a  contract on the Tezos blockchain, there is external state changing between the calls to this function,  which will not be reflected by the object returned by the call to  loadContract . Without a thorough   Security Audit Report | Thanos Wallet | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          understanding of how Taquito is managing the internals of this object since this functionality is  undocumented, it is difficult to fully understand the potential security implications.     Impact   The inappropriate memoization may fail to reflect certain changes within the contract, depending on the  implementation of the wallet interface and specific Taquito implementation details. As a result, this could  cause users to miss updates in contract state between transactions.    Technical Details   Initially, our team was concerned that the memoization would prevent users from seeing updates in the  wallet balance after transactions. While it appears that this is not the case, it is only because Taquitos  ContractAbstraction   getStorage  method issues an RPC, which seems to compensate in our tests.  However, this raises two points:    1. This memoization function appears to offer little benefit, since calls to the Tezos blockchain will   always need to be made.    2. Memoizing this function makes it extremely difficult to ensure that parts of the Thanos Wallet   codebase are functioning properly, as the side effects required in order for it to function properly  are caused by undocumentated implementation details in Taquito.   Remediation   In general, memoization should only be used on pure functions (i.e. functions that have no side effects  and do not depend on any external state). Since the  loadContract  function depends on external state  (the state of the wallet contract on Tezos), this memoization has the potential to cause the function to  return incorrect values.   Given that there appears to be minimal benefit to memoizing this function and it adds a great deal of  complexity to understanding its operation, we recommend removing this functionality. Furthermore, it  should be assured that all memoization is occurring only on functions that have no side effects and no  dependency on external state.    Status   After talking with the Thanos team, we learned that the state being depended on was the structure of the  contract, rather than the value, which is not something that is subject to change and can let us view it as a  pure function in this instance. However, with the memoization functionality, we had additional concerns  about the technical details of memoizing complex objects that were then modified after retrieval. Since it  appears that the chosen memoization library does not perform deep copies of objects by default, care  must be used if the  WalletContract  object returned is modified, especially if it is being accessed in a  parallel manner. However, due to the design of Thanos, the only mutation being performed is requesting  that the  WalletContract  update its storage to reflect the latest state of the Tezos blockchain, and as  such seems safe.    The Thanos team implemented a  fix  by utilizing a library called  micro-memoize  which is better equipped  to handle promised memoization. Additionally, we have found that Taquito has confirmed in a  news  announcement  that accessing storage issuing a new call to the Tezos blockchain is a deliberate and  advertised design decision. Finally, after discussion with the Thanos team we better understand the  design concerns that warrant the memoization, and recognize that this reduces overhead by only  retrieving the schema for a contract a single time, while wanting to perform storage retrieval optimization  many times after.   With this in mind, and with the improved handling of complicated values the new library offers, we believe  this issue has been resolved.   Security Audit Report | Thanos Wallet | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   6   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.      Additionally, we would recommend that an integration test be added to ensure that this operation remains  stable. If in future designs of the Thanos wallet, more operations that modify internal state end up being  performed on the cached  WalletContract  object, consider having the memoization library clone that  object before returning it to prevent some tricky bugs.

A form of it is present in Loopring as well: operators have the ability to process state but not reveal this processed state to anyone.

At a later point, the operator can reveal the block that includes the transaction that invalidates the withdrawal and block the process of forced withdrawal. These forced withdrawals require fees to be processed, and if the withdrawal is invalidated by the revealed block, the user will be griefed a small amount for the fees.

        "body": "  Location  liquidity/keeper/liquidity_pool.go#L883  Synopsis  Each Tendermint Liquidity Pool requires a unique reserve account address to keep track of the funds deposited or withdrawn from the pool. At present, a SHA-256 hash function is used to ensure that different pools have unique reserve account addresses.  For example, for a pool with tokens tokenX and tokenY, and pool identier poolId, the reserve account address is computed as:  sdk.AccAddressFromHex(SHA256(denomX/denomY/poolId)[:40])  The SHA-256 hash output is truncated to 20 bytes (or 40   characters) before the account address is generated. This effectively reduces the security provided by the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Although the address generation requires 20 bytes as the input, we recommend analyzing the security implications of using truncated SHA-256 outputs.  Security Audit Report | Cosmos SDK Liquidity Module | All in Bits 24 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Impact  It is possible for an attacker to identify input strings to the SHA-256 hash function, such that the rst 20 bytes of the output matches. The result is that two different liquidity pools, both possibly created by the attacker, could have the same reserve account address. This would directly impact the deposit, withdraw, and swap functionalities of these two pools in the Liquidity Module. The truncated SHA-256 is widely used in the Cosmos ecosystem for deterministic address generation, however, in the particular case of the Liquidity Module, the negative security implications of using truncated SHA-256 exceed the benet of simple address generation.  Remediation  80  While the likelihood of an attack is theoretically very small ( computations), we recommend conducting a thorough analysis of the security of the truncated SHA-256 hash function. The NIST provides guidelines on secure use of truncation in approved hash functions, such as SHA-256. We also recommend exploring alternative hash functions, such as Keccak, which allow variable output digest size. For example, we suggest exploring a combination of SHA-256 with RIPEMD-160 hash functions, which could provide better preimage and collision resistance. The SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 combination is used in the generation of P2PKH addresses in Bitcoin [V17].  2  Status  The Tendermint team has responded that the SHA-256 truncation problem is not specic to the Liquidity Module and, as a result, they will not be making any changes.

        "body": "   Location   https://github.com/LeastAuthority/metamask-json-rpc-capabilities-middleware/blob/master/index.ts#L5 58-L585   Synopsis   The capabilities middleware grants permission based on the resolution of a promise returned from a  user-defined function. This leaves the security of the permission system up to the Promise  implementation.   Impact   Critical. An attacker could silently subvert the permissions system and gain full access to users wallets.   Preconditions   Attacker is able to overwrite the Promise implementation, by compromising a dependency.   Feasibility   Unknown. The attackers ability to compromise a dependency depends on how frequently and thoroughly  the dependencies are reviewed and audited, the security practices of maintainers of the dependencies,  the security of the package registry, build pipelines, and many other areas of concern. Due to the surface  area of dependency poisoning attacks, we are not able to say definitively what the feasibility of such an  attack is, given that much of this area is outside of the scope of this audit.   Technical Details   The JSON RPC capabilities middleware package provides access to a particular set of methods by  requesting permission from the end user. In the context of this package, that permission request is an   Final Security Audit Report | MetaMask Permissions System + CapNode 27 November 2019  |  Least Authority TFA GmbH   4   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        unspecified, user-designated, promise-returning function. The package that uses this (the extension itself)  supplies this function, which displays a dialog in the user interface and, based on the end users input,  either resolves or rejects the Promise.   In the middleware, it is decided whether or not to provide access to these methods based on the  Promises ending status. If resolved with the appropriate permission data, then the user is given access,  otherwise access is denied. In our attack, we act as a rogue dependency to overwrite the global Promise  implementation used such that all Promises always resolve with the permission data for which we desire  access. In doing so, regardless of how the user interacts with the permission dialog, the middleware will  always act as though the permissions were granted.   This is particularly problematic because this may be completely invisible to the end user. The user will  deny the permission request and believe that the denial was successful, while in truth, the attacker may  then make use of whichever wallet functions were exposed. This attack was validated by modifying a  Promise polyfill to suit our attack and using it to overwrite the global Promise, then authoring a test within  the existing test suite.    diff --git a/test/requestPermissions.js b/test/requestPermissions.js  index cab1a02..39e9db7 100644  --- a/test/requestPermissions.js  +++ b/test/requestPermissions.js  @@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ const rpcErrors = require('eth-json-rpc-errors')   const USER_REJECTION_CODE =  require('../dist/src/errors').USER_REJECTED_ERROR.code   const INVALID_REQUEST_CODE = rpcErrors.ERROR_CODES.jsonRpc.invalidRequest   +   test('requestPermissions with user rejection creates no permissions', async  (t) => {     const expected = []   @@ -182,3 +183,51 @@ async function sendRpcMethodWithResponse(ctrl, domain,  req) {       }     })   }  +  +test('modifying the promise prototype can grant self permissions',  function(t) {  +  OldPromise = Promise;  +  Promise = require('./bad-promise')  +  +  const expected = {  +    parentCapability: 'restricted',  +    invoker: 'all.your.base'  +  };  +  +  const ctrl = new CapabilitiesController({  +    requestUserApproval: () => {  +      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  +        reject(new Error('User rejected permissions'));  +      });  +    },  +    restrictedMethods: {  +      restricted: (req, res, next, end) => {  +        res.result = 'Wahoo!';  +        end();   Final Security Audit Report | MetaMask Permissions System + CapNode 27 November 2019  |  Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.            +      }  +    }  +  })  +  +  const domain = { origin: 'all.your.base' }  +  let req = {  +    method: 'requestPermissions',  +    params: [  +        {restricted: {}}  +    ]  +  }  +  let res = {}  +  +  ctrl.providerMiddlewareFunction(domain, req, res, next, end)  +  +  function next() {  +    t.ok(false, 'next should not be called')  +    t.end()  +  }  +  +  function end() {  +    const perms = ctrl.getPermissionsForDomain(domain.origin)[0];  +    t.ok(equal(perms.parentCapability, expected.parentCapability), 'has  correct parentCapability');  +    t.ok(equal(perms.invoker, expected.invoker), 'has correct invoker');  +    Promise = OldPromise;  +    t.end()  +  }  +});   The Promise polyfill used can be reviewed at:  https://gist.github.com/emeryrose/c0195b091d7910d14cf0762073674b16#file-bad-promise-js-L439-L44 1    Mitigation   While Promises are used extensively throughout the code and a complete evaluation of how this type of  attack might impact all of those areas was not feasible within the timeframe, we do know that the impact  on the  requestUserPermissions  function is that an attacker can completely circumvent the  permission dialog. An effective mitigation for this specific area of concern would be to simply trade the  use of a Promise returning function for a standard node-style callback.   Remediation   The longer term remediation for this entire class of issues is a complete and verified implementation of  SESify/LavaMoat.

As a result, as long as the options  given in the caveat are provided, other unlisted options may also be used.   Impact   The impact depends on what the specific permissioned API does and what options it uses. If option A  was left out of the caveat that grants option B, a call enabling options A and B would pass.   Preconditions   An API that has some features that are restricted but are enabled by an option, possibly to reveal private  data, or excede a spend limit.   Feasibility   Unknown. Depends upon the implementation. See  Preconditions .   Technical Details   The arguments to  isSubset  were in reverse order, meaning it was checking if the caveat options are a  superset not a subset. This was not caught by the test cases because they only tested with equal inputs  (and an equal set is also a subset).   The error is that the  isSubset  module had arguments in an unexpected order. Instead of reading left to  right,  isSubset(A,B)  meaning is A subset of B, it was in reverse order. While the metamask code had  the correct intentions, it was assumed that the arguments applied from left to right.   Remediation   Correct the order of the options to  isSubset . Test cases that checked against inputs that were actually  subsets or supersets would have also caught this problem.

This is then passed to a module that interprets this as a character length,  returning a 20 character long string that has only 10 bytes of entropy.   Impact   The entropy is reduced from a level that would be cryptographically unguessable to one that would  potentially be guessable. It would require a significant amount of time to do so but is no longer in the  bounds that would make the entropy unguessable.   Preconditions   To brute force a message ID, it would be necessary to have an oracle of some form (a part of the system  that behaves in a way that yes and no answers can be required of it).

Final Security Audit Report | MetaMask Permissions System + CapNode 27 November 2019  |  Least Authority TFA GmbH   8   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Preconditions   The attacker must know the method ID. Since the entropy of the method ID is low ( Issue C ) its  conceivable that it could be guessed. The method ID could also be obtained by exploiting a vulnerability in  another remote, or the remote could leak it intentionally.   Feasibility   The feasibility depends greatly upon the implementation. We do know that even a modestly sized botnet  could brute force the 10-byte key used within a reasonable amount of time, especially if it is evident that  user funds could be compromised.    Technical Details   An incoming message is passed to  processMessage  which then checks the message type and forwards  the message to the appropriate handler, along with a reference to an  emitMessage  function that allows  the handler to respond to the caller. For an invocation (calling a remote function), the arguments are  deserialized (which includes regenerating functions from any method IDs given in the serialized form) and  these are passed to the function. The return value is then sent back to the calling remote (if it was a  Promise, it would wait until it is resolved). If a function was at some point passed to a call, its method ID  gets registered, along with a reference to a function that send messages to the remote, which passed that  function. If the  messageid  chosen by the first remote becomes known to another remote, they may now  call it, and the CapNode instance will act as a proxy between the two remotes.   This also affects other interactions around method IDs. For example, peers can dealloc methods they do  not own but know the method ID (except for index methods).   Mitigation   Resolving  Issue C  would prevent the possibility of guessing the method ID. Tracking which remote owns a  function and checking that the calling remote is acceptable, would probably be a small change to the  current code.   Remediation   To fully prevent the problem, have separate registries for each remote and for each set of local methods  exposed to a particular remote. That way, its always clear what context a registered method is to be used  in, then it doesnt matter if two remotes share the same method id. This means they can even be  incrementing integers.   Status   The usage of the method registry code has been updated to ensure that instances of the registry are on a  per-connection basis. The MetaMask team has also indicated that this will be the first of a series of  improvements that should prevent shared instance usage between connections.   Verification   Partially Resolved.   ",

Synopsis   Javascript Maps index functions by their source. However, due to closure references, functions can have  the same source but display different behaviour. This will result in bugs.   Impact   This is an ordinary correctness bug. Since it does work as intended if only one or two functions are  registered, it could be considered a security bug, but it is also likely to break on many non malicious  applications.   Preconditions   More than one function that happens to have the same string value is registered. Due to closure scope, if  using functional programming techniques (functions that return functions), it is likely that functions with  the same source have different behavior. If two of these are registered, the second one will steal the first  ones method ID.   Feasibility   Likely to happen accidentally in a medium to large application.   Technical Details   Javascript Maps store a key:value array that accept Javascript objects or primitives as keys. However, if a  function is used as the key, the source string of that function is used. That means if you have two  functions that are not equal,  fn1 !== fn2,  but have the same source,  fn1.toString() ===  fn2.toString(),  the second function will steal the method ID of the first function when it is registered.   Remediation   Remove the reverse function map, allowing the same function to be registered twice and giving it more  than one method ID.   Alternatively, instead of maintaining a reverse index of functions, iterate over the registry and check each  one with === when checking if a function already exists. This will check functions by reference, which will  behave as expected.   Status   This issue was reported based on the incorrect assumption that JavaScript maps were indexed by their  source string, however this is not the case - they are indexed by their ID.

Synopsis  UniswapTrader trusts the balanceOf and transfer methods of ERC-20 tokens to behave correctly. A maliciously designed token can trick UniswapTrader into allowing more tokens to be sold than were bought, rewarding the attacker with VanillaGovernanceTokens.  Impact  An attacker can execute the attack at low cost, repeating as often as desired to obtain an unlimited number of VanillaGovernanceTokens. This will increase the supply of VanillaGovernanceTokens in circulation and potentially lower their value for other token holders.  Preconditions  The attacker must create a malicious token and list it on Uniswap before executing trades via VanillaRouter.  Feasibility  The attack is straightforward and can be carried out easily.  Technical Details  In order to receive VanillaGovernanceTokens,a trader must make a protable trade. The degree to which a trade is judged protable is dependent on the number of tokens sold. The protability of a trade in which the number of tokens sold is greater than the number previously bought (i.e. at a comparable price) increases as the delta between the number of tokens bought and sold increases.  Security Audit Report | Vanilla Smart Contracts | Equilibrium 23 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   With honest tokens, this attack is not possible. The strategy for tricking VanillaRouter with a malicious token consists of the following steps:  1. Buy a certain number (n) of tokens normally. 2. Change the behavior of the ERC-20 token so that before the next trade the balanceOf method  will return 0.  3. Buy more tokens. The UniswapTrader._buyInUniswap method computes the number of  tokens purchased as the difference between the post-trade balance and the pre-trade balance. In normal conditions, the pre-trade balance will be n but the attack has articially set it to 0, inating the perceived number of tokens to be the equal to the post-trade balance.  4. Change the behavior of the ERC-20 token so that, during the next trade, it will allow a transfer  amount that exceeds the balance.  5. Sell the inated perceived number of tokens and receive unearned  VanillaGovernanceTokens.  Mitigation  VanillaRouter can protect itself immediately from this attack by allowing the trade of only whitelisted tokens. It is worth considering to audit tokens for whitelisting in a similar way that Bskt has implemented for their platform.  Remediation  It may be possible to reduce exposure to the trusted balanceOf method by utilizing the return value of Uniswaps swapExactETHForTokens instead of using swap when buying tokens. Further investigation would be required in order to determine whether this eliminates the vulnerability.  UniswapTrader._sellInUniswap should perform its own check to make sure that no more tokens are being sold in a transaction than have been previously purchased rather than relying on the ERC-20 token to enforce this.  Status  The Equilibrium team has addressed the vulnerability by amending the contract to only issue rewards for whitelisted tokens, in accordance with the recommended mitigation.

It may be  possible that some of these transfers could be done in such a way that the approver is left with an  unexpected balance. This depends on the ability or requirement of the approver to update their balance. If  this case is present then this issue recorded within   [REC19]   may be of relevance:    An ERC20 security issue, known as the \"multiple withdrawal attack\", was raised on GitHub and has  been open since November 2016. The issue concerns ERC20's defined method  approve()  which  was envisioned as a way for token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to  withdraw a capped number of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to  adjust the amount of approved tokens from  N  to  M  (this could be an increase or decrease). If  malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for  N  tokens can front-run the adjustment transaction to  first withdraw  N  tokens, then allow the approval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional  M  tokens.   Impact   High. Possible loss of tokens.   Preconditions   There must be an approval adjustment that is vulnerable to this attack.    Feasibility   Approval adjustments that could be vulnerable must be able to be acted upon by the approved party and  must be able to be spent quickly enough to make this feasible. An example of this may be in the lender  contract that mints tokens based on an approved currency amount. However, we are unsure if balance  adjustments to the approval can be made to incentivise the lender into acting on minting or burning in  favor of receiving or redeeming more currency than was expected.     Security Audit Report | Tinlake Contracts + Actions | Centrifuge 7 April 2020  by Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Technical Details   Full details of this attack, along with a number of approaches to mitigation, is contained in   [REC19] .   Mitigation   Enforce approval balance is set to 0 before adjusting an approval or CAS approved to eliminate the  possibility that the approved amount of a token is ever less or more than expected. See the paper linked in  the technical details for more in-depth mitigation details.    In addition, create detailed documentation of every token transfer that uses this method to ensure that  there are no cases where a party may conceal the intended approval amount of a token.   Status   The Centrifuge team has acknowledged the existence of the multiple withdrawal attack within the  approve()  function and have decided not to deviate from the MakerDAO DAI stablecoin ERC 20  implementation that also includes this attack vector.    We strongly encourage the Centrifuge team to examine every possible way that a tokens approved  amount to a spender, whether user or contract, might need to be adjusted and whether or not it could be  possible for the multiple withdrawal attack to cause any amount of tokens to be spent unexpectedly. If  understanding every possible scenario that a tokens approval may need to be adjusted is not possible,  then we encourage the Centrifuge team to implement the suggested safety method to prevent unknown  or unforeseen situations.

It could become possible for the removal of all wards  from the state by calling  deny() . This would leave the contracts that depend on this authentication in an  unusable state.

Preconditions   The last owner or ward of the authenticated contract must deny themselves access by accident in order  for a contract that relies heavily on authentication to lose control, where or when it was not intended to  lose all ownership.   Remediation   Add a minimal amount of state that tracks the amount of wards that own a contract and ensure that it is  intentional if the amount of wards becomes 0. Add a function that explicitly declares the intended  functionality of removing all wards is to remove all functionality from a ward controlled contract.    Status   The Centrifuge team has stated that they are aware of the possibility that total ownership of a contract or  functionality could be inadvertently removed. However, they note that this is an unlikely edge case, as an  owner must remove all other owners and then lastly remove themselves. As a result, the Centrifuge team  does not intend to implement the suggested remediation as they consider the ability to remove all owners  from the contract with the  deny()  function an intended feature. We encourage the Centrifuge team to be  explicit about when and where it is intended to remove all owners to prevent any accidental cases, which  could potentially cause irreparable damage.

This disk  access can be exploited to consume a nodes resources.   Impact   We consider this a high impact issue, which has the potential to flood any node in the system with valid  requests that would immediately return at no expense to the attacker, with the exception of the initial  storage cost for the  Piece .    Preconditions   The  StorageMiner  must store a  Piece  for the attacker and the attacker must format a request for a  Piece  in such a way that it is valid except for the  UnsealPrice ,  PaymentIntervalIncrease ,  PaymentInterval , or  PricePerByte . This still causes the disk to be accessed but the payment terms  to be rejected.   Feasibility   This attack can be carried out by a single actor with a Filecoin node and a fair amount of knowledge of the  Filecoin specification and implementations.   Technical Details   The attacker stores a  Piece  with a given  StorageMiner . As soon as the  Piece  is stored, the attacker  can begin crafting a request that would be out of the range of the  StorageMiner s accepted payment  parameters (in this instance, the configurable parameters are  deal.PricePerByte ,  deal.PaymentInterval ,  deal.PaymentIntervalIncrease , or  deal.UnsealPrice ) and start  flooding the victim with requests for that  Piece . When the  RetrievalMarket  provider goes to handle  the retrieval request, they check that they have the  Piece  in storage, which then triggers a disk read and  loads the  Piece .  The   RetrievalMarket  provider then validates the price parameters, which returns an  error and stops the request. This is significant because it means it will not cost the attacker anything to  send requests, as  vouchers  are not processed if the request is denied for being out of bounds, however,  they are able to incur unnecessary and non-trivial disk usage to check.

For example, approver A allows a spender B ten tokens and goes offline. At some point in the future, B  spends five of the approved tokens and A does not witness this. A then decides to only allow the  spending of six tokens to B and calls the approve function to set the balance to zero before calling it  again to allow B to spend six tokens.

B may  also witness the incoming reset of the approve to zero tokens transaction and bribe a miner to include a  spend of ten tokens before this happens without A knowing.   Impact   As discussed in  ERC20 API: An Attack Vector on Approve/TransferFrom Methods , this can still lead to  front running attacks where it is not clear via blockchain references to the sender if the previous approval  had spent any of the total amount.

Preconditions   This exists in all standard FA1.2 tokens that implement  Approve .    Feasibility   This attack requires that the Approver does not have a good view of the current state of a token  contract. This could happen if their client is out of date, but it is not highly likely that an Approver will not  see an amount already spent. It is also possible for an approved address to bribe a miner to include their  spend before a reduction of their proved amount gets into the blockchain, however, this is also unlikely.   Technical Details   The FA1.2 Token standard implemented in this contract adds a layer of security to prevent a front running  attack on the  Approve  method. This is done by checking that the approval of any amount that is not  already zero is set to zero before adding more approved tokens. As documented by the FA1.2 spec, an  error is provided: UnsafeAllowanceChange - attempt to change approval value from non-zero to non-zero  was performed. The error will contain nat :previous value, where previous stands for the allowance value  upon the contract call.    Mitigation   Keeping state to handle this would be a better approach but may be out of the scope of the project. This  would represent the atomic solution mentioned in the document above. A miner being bribed to spend the  approval before revoking could still happen, but the approvers transaction would then fail to notify them  that the change cannot happen and an amount was already spent.

A Solidity equivalent reference to this can be found in this documentation on  Gas Limits and  Loops . While attempts can be seen to reduce the gas cost within these loops, the hard limit remains and  there is the potential of a stalled state when a transaction runs out of gas if this behaves the same as  Ethereum. Tezos transactions have a hard limit of 400,000 units of gas, and we found that each storage  call to the batched whitelist function requires 496 units. At 154 addresses, the contract call could stall if  the client does not reject this before submission to the network. Longer lists will lead to larger  transactions that may be harder to include in blocks if there is a heavy load on the network, and a larger  fee may need to be applied to fit the transaction in on time.    Security Audit Report | BTG Pactual | Tezos Foundation 13 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   7   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Impact   A stalled transaction could leave the state of updates using loops unknown for the client. The client may  believe that all updates were applied when not all of them made it into the contract state or attempt to  reapply the same update twice.   Feasibility   The client that is providing the list of users to be updated may be aware in advance by testing if a  transaction will run out of gas so this may not be necessary. The Solidity version of the contract code  mentions iterating off-chain to avoid this.   Mitigation   We suggest writing a unit test that attempts to enter 154 addresses into the  updateWhiteListBatched  function and dividend disbursement test the behavior of hitting the 400,000  gas unit limit.   Another approach would be to call a function that updates one account at a time in a loop off-chain, with  some state on-chain that marks if an account has been updated such that an off-chain loop can call many  times the same function without ever hitting a gas limit. If the off-chain client calls an update to the  function more than once, the contract state will prevent it from updating. This could function like a nonce  for preventing multisig replay of stale state.    Status   Invalid Issue. Tezos has responded that they have considered the loops thoroughly and have confirmed  that this issue has been handled due to the loops being bound and verifiable ahead of time. Incomplete  state updates are also not an issue with Tezos as it is with Ethereum smart contracts, since either a call  succeeds or fails leaving no partial updates when gas depletes.

If a generic multisig wallet is used, then signers may unknowingly process an unexpected  transaction.   Impact   The parameters may be improperly constructed before signing which could lead to signatures on  transactions that were not intended (i.e. an improper update address or call to an unexpected function). If  the multisig contract owns the token, this could cause total loss of control.   Technical Details   The contract allows for the generic multisig contract to control execution of generic functions on the  contract system.

Since there are no tests on the multisig contract itself, it is assumed that tests exist elsewhere. It is  difficult to understand the functionality of the multisig contract without proper tests. There could be a  case where the contract is updated to null list, or a list with below the threshold of necessary signers.   Impact   The multisig contract will be the controlling address of the token and unexpected behavior can cause loss  of control of the token. If there is not a proper modifier to limit the ability of ownership change to prevent  the case where there are no owners of the multisig, then control will be lost.   Mitigation   We suggest writing proper tests on the multisig contract.   Status   The generic multisig has been replaced with a specific multisig wrapper that has been integrated into the  client.

        "title": "Issue A: Stealth Addresses Provide Only 64-Bit of Security by Default",
        "body": "  Location  src/classes/RandomNumber.ts#L37  Synopsis  In the Umbra Protocol, as implemented by umbra-js, stealth addresses are derived from spending keys by scalar multiplication with random numbers. However, these numbers only contain 128 bits of randomness by default, in addition to 128 bits that can be used for short messages but are zeroes by default. In elliptic curve cryptography, 128 bits of randomness translates to 64 bits of security, which is insucient.  Impact  Stealth addresses may be brute force derivable from spending keys and vice versa.  Preconditions  The attack assumes that the sender does not ll up the upper 16 bytes of the random number with cryptographically strong randomness on their own. In addition, the attacker needs access to the stealth address public key, which is given if the target account has signed a transaction (e.g. a withdrawal).  Feasibility  The attack only requires to run a standard brute force discrete log algorithm, such as the Pollard-Rho method, which is feasible for short secret values. For similar problems in secp256k1, practical attacks already exist, with readily available code. As a result, we estimate that it is not dicult to adapt the code to the context of the Umbra Protocol.  Technical Details  In the Umbra Protocol, spending keys as well as stealth addresses are points on the elliptic curve secp256k1, where secret keys have a size of 256 bits. If a spending key address key  is computed as the secp256k1 scalar multiplication of a random number  is given, any associated stealth \ud835\udc5f , supposed to  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc60  be from the secp256k1 scalar eld, with the spending key, specically,    =  [\ud835\udc5f] \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc60  For an attacker, associating any stealth address public key to a given spending key is as dicult as nding a discrete log relation between the two curve points. For cryptographically strong 256-bit random numbers r, this should provide roughly 128-bit security, assuming that the fastest algorithms, such as the Pollard-Rho method, have runtimes in the order of 2^(len(r)/2). The random number is then encrypted and published on-chain.  However, the Umbra Protocol only uses the lower 16 bytes of the random number, overwriting the upper 16 bytes with zeros by default, which then only gives roughly 64 bits of security. The purpose is to give the sender 16 bytes of space to transmit encrypted short messages, along with the actual randomness to the public key owners.  NIST 800-131A [BR19] presents the security level to target, which for all classes of protocols does not consider anything below 112-bit security and corresponding elliptic curve key lengths of 224 bits to be suciently secure.  Security Audit Report | Umbra-js | ScopeLift 25 May 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  6  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Mitigation  If a message or memo eld is required and a security level below 128 bits is acceptable, we recommend choosing the bit lengths of the memo eld f_memo and random data f_rand, such that the sum is 256 bits. This results in a security level of at least len(f_rand)/2.  From these bit lengths, a uniformly random scalar eld element (i.e. a number less than group order n) must be computed. To do so, we recommend using a hash function or an extractor like HKDF-Extract (which is just a way of using HMAC) to extract a 256-bit value sk_stealth from the SMS and random value. If sk_stealth >= n, pick a new random number and try again. This should be repeated until an appropriate value is found. Submit the encryption of f_memo and f_rand as usual and the receiver can try to decrypt, extract the value, and check if the stealth address matches. If it does not match, or if the announcement extracts to a value >= n, they can then deduce that they are not the recipient.  In addition, we recommend updating the Umbra documentation to reect the changes to the protocol, as well as the reasoning behind the chosen lengths and security parameters.  Remediation  We recommend using the full 256 bits from the curves scalar eld as the random number.  In addition, we recommend updating the Umbra documentation to reect the changes to the protocol, as well as the reasoning behind the chosen lengths and security parameters.  Status  The ScopeLift team has updated the code to use the entire 256 bits of randomness for the random number. Additionally, the update removes support for memos or messages, leading to full 128-bit security.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

These public keys are binary representations of points that are supposedly on the elliptic curve. However, not all binary strings are representations of valid curve points.  Impact  Publishing results of computations on invalid curve points may leak sensitive data that contains or allows inference or linking of key material. This issue specically impacts the handling of uncompressed curve points, since compressed curve points are implicitly checked for validity during decompression. In addition, not checking for public key validity puts the privacy of the recipient of a transaction at risk.  Preconditions  The public key must enter the system in uncompressed form and not be validated. The attacker must pick a point in a compatible, yet weak curve.  Security Audit Report | Umbra-js | ScopeLift 25 May 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Feasibility  The attack requires some computational resources, but not enough to make the attack infeasible.  Technical Details  Elliptic curve public keys are points and often are described using the two ane coordinates x and y. However, only the points that satisfy the respective curve equation are valid public keys. Public keys entering the system need to be validated. For compressed points this happens implicitly, because the y coordinate is not transmitted in full and is found by solving the curve equation, which means the equation is trivially satised or the decompression fails. For uncompressed points, however, validity needs to be checked explicitly.  Failure to check public key validity could make the protocol vulnerable to invalid curve attacks described in [ABM+03], which further lead to small subgroup attacks and the possibility of weak shared secrets being used, allowing an attacker to compute encryption keys or stealth addresses.  Remediation  We recommend consistent checking of whether uncompressed public keys fulll the curve equation by adding a check to the respective part in the constructor of the KeyPair class.

The Consensus Protocol can lead to a change in the current chain, and the best tip ledger is updated. In this case, the transactions in the pool need to be revalidated based on the new best tip ledger. If commands are dropped, any related data needs to be deleted from the pool.

For a signed command, the fee payer must be equal to the source account.  A check to enforce equality between the public keys of the fee payer and the source account is missing in the Transaction Logic and the Transaction SNARK.

Synopsis  Zkopru uses a variant of the BN254 curve, also called BN128. In 2016, advances in number theory led to a lower security estimate of that curve. Specically, its security is now considered to be around 96 bits. This is signicantly lower than the 112 bits currently required by NIST for new products.  Impact  Use of the BN254 curve reduces the security of the zk-SNARK scheme, such that the feasibility of computing valid, forged proofs cannot be ruled out. Such proofs would pass validation, yet violate the constraints imposed by the circuit. For example, a valid, forged proof could spend UTXOs arbitrarily.  Feasibility  Although the exact feasibility is dicult to estimate, the potential gains from a successful attack are high. This suggests that an attacker would have incentive to invest signicant resources resulting in an increased risk that the feasibility is reasonable.  Technical Details  Attacks based on the Tower Number Field Sieve (TNFS) and the derivative exTNDS and SexTNFS have led to a reduced estimate of the security level of BN254. Consensus on the new estimate has not been reached by scholars and practitioners working on this issue, however, opinions range from 96 bits to 110 bits [KB15, MSS16, BD17, P16]. Regardless of where on this spectrum the real value falls, it is still too low. Even for applications that only need to remain secure until 2030, NIST requires a security level of at least 112 bits [B20, Table 4], which BN254 does not achieve.  Remediation  We recommend using the curve BLS12-381. According to the draft RFC on pairing-friendly curves [SLK+20], it has a security level of ~128 bits, which is above the 112 bits considered sucient by NIST until 2030.  Status  The Berlin hard fork upgrade will no longer contain EIP-2537 and, as a result, 384 bit arithmetic in the EVM (i.e. EVM-384) is currently unavailable. Given this change, there is currently no ecient method for secure pairing based cryptography that is able to achieve at least 112 bits of security, as required by NIST for new products. Thus, a long-term remediation is not currently possible and we recommend that the Zkopru team continue to monitor developments with EIP-2537.  Verication  Unresolved.  ",

Impact  A well written SNARK statement improves the security of the SNARK by making it easier to reason abstractly about the security properties of the zk-SNARK itself. Statements that are not well designed carry the risk of unintended solutions, which will enable a malicious prover to nd valid proofs for unintended system behavior. Since zero-knowledge is involved, those proofs, that are valid but malicious, would be potentially very dicult to detect.

In Zkopru, the intended mode is to always enable the signature check, but in the commit we audited, we found this variable to be set in such a way that signature checks were always disabled.  On inspection of the commit history, we discovered that previous commits correctly enabled the signature check as expected. The vulnerability was introduced in a commit, most likely due to a need for large code refactoring, since Circom and snarkjs both underwent prior major changes.  Impact  Severe. Without enabled signature checks, the ownership proof will always be valid, regardless of the correctness of the signature. A malicious proofer might use this vulnerability to forge valid zk-SNARK  Security Audit Report | Zkopru zk-SNARK Circuits + Smart Contracts | Ethereum Foundation 22 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  12  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   proofs. As the signature is private data and hence not revealed to the public, this kind of behaviour would be potentially very dicult to detect.  Feasibility  Forging an ownership proof with the signature check disabled is a trivial effort. Whether this can be used to transfer value from UTXOs that are not owned by the attacker is not easy to estimate, as this depends on the ability of the attacker to provide all the other private data required to generate a valid proof.  Technical Details  In the gadget OwnershipProof(), the EdDSAPoseidonVerifier() subgadgets input signal eddsa.enabled is dened as the constant 0, whereas it should be dened as 1. We note that the correct setting is used in commits preceding the commit under investigation for this audit.  Remediation  Set eddsa.enabled to 1 so that the ownership proof works as intended. In addition, extend test coverage, to ensure that no future code update can re-introduce this vulnerability.  Status  The Zkopru team changed eddsa.enabled to 1 and added an ownership test catching the issue upon reintroduction.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

        "body": "  Location  zkopru-network/protocol-specification/  Synopsis  In SNARK statement design, attention should be given to the accuracy of the specications, as well as the mathematical and proong aspects of system design. In doing so, a comprehensive list of security assumptions should be clearly specied that can then be compared against the coded implementation.  Zkopru uses the zk-SNARK Groth16 to provide a range proof while hiding the account balance. The Groth16 SNARK hinges on certain cryptographic assumptions about elliptic curve pairings and requires a trusted setup. The common reference string (CRS) is usually constructed through a secure multi-party computation (MPC). In our audit, we found that the documentation did not explicitly mention the cryptographic assumptions. Details about the construction of the CRS were also missing.  Technical Details  During our review, we rst audited the zk-SNARK implementation for coding errors and then compared it to the statement that the Zkopru team provided to us upon request (see the section System Design). However, we identied four problems with the statement provided:  1. The assumptions that the system relies on are not explicit. 2. The properties that the SNARK is intended to guarantee are not explicit. 3. There are no proper proofs for the guaranteed properties. 4. There is not any reference to the common reference string that is used in the system and there is  not a description about how that CRS was computed, or why it can be trusted.  Security Audit Report | Zkopru zk-SNARK Circuits + Smart Contracts | Ethereum Foundation 22 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  13  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   In the Zkopru transaction documentation, the following is stated:  Zkopru achieves privacy using the commitment-nullier scheme. It means that a zk transaction spends a UTXO while not revealing which note has been used.  However, from a security point of view, this is too vague. For example, exactly what is guaranteed to stay private and under what assumptions is unclear. Additionally, it is unknown to which commitment-nullier scheme the documentation refers to and there is not a proof for the claimed properties.  Mitigation  If writing a proper proof is untenable at this point in the Zkopru project, we recommend that at least the statement description is expanded by providing a clear list of assumptions, referencing the common reference string trusted setup phase and making the claimed guarantees as explicit as possible. At minimum, some high level reasoning should be given about why it is impossible to unreveal any spent UTXO.  Remediation  In [BCG+14], the authors dened their version of what they called a decentralized anonymous payment scheme [DAP scheme], and then proved its critical properties like ledger indistinguishability, transaction non-malleability and balance invariance (Section 3.4, [BCG+14]).  We recommend to rst make the Zkopru adaptation of a DAP scheme explicit, then derive an analog to theorem 4.1 in [BCG+14] and prove equivalent properties, which could be called something like contract state indistinguishability, transaction non-malleability and multi-asset-balance invariance. In contrast to [BCG+14], more than one asset type is involved, so a proper denition of something we could call a multi-asset commitment-nullier scheme is needed.  Status  The Zkopru team developed a specication for the protocol, which includes a zk-SNARK statement. However, a formal specication of the SNARK properties and security proofs is still missing. The trusted setup has been completed on the Zkopru website and they have noted that a verication script will soon be published.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  ",

Moreover, an attack of this type would be potentially undetectable, since tokens would only be seen on the smart contract side.

Furthermore, code comments can highlight other key information, such as which areas are vulnerable to potential failure, which is critical in making sure the system is implemented correctly. A comprehensive description of the intended functionality of each gadget is missing. The lack of sucient code comments hinders the readability and auditability of the code.

They make bids that must increase by 10% each accepted bid, until a time limit. But a front runner can submit the same bid with a slightly higher gas price to get their transaction moved to the start of the next block and considered the rst bid, and thus winning that price.  Impact  A front runner can win burn auctions and force honest bidders to increase bids, possibly making coordinating Zkopru unprotable for honest participants.  Preconditions  An honest coordinator is making a burn auction bid to gain block submission rights and then make a prot from transaction fees.  Technical Details  For coordinating to be protable, the amount spent in burn auctions must be less than the average amount gained in fees. This means that the burn auction is a competition about who can most accurately model the distribution of fees. The requirement that a bid be 10% more than the previous bid actually makes coordinating quite protable. Assuming accurate expected fees are known, then it is possible to make a bid slightly below the average fee, such that the next bid will be above it. For example, if 109 in fees is expected, and then 100 is bid, the next bid would be 110, which would lose 1 unit. Since fees are public information, it's expected that all coordinators know the averages. However, a front runner can submit the same bid, but at a slightly higher gas price, this forces the honest coordinator to make a bid at least 10% more, which may be unprotable.  Mitigation  Bids should be submitted with very high gas prices as close to the end of the block as possible, to reduce the chance that a front runner will have time to get their transaction in.  Remediation  Bids could be made with a commit-and-reveal pattern, or use a different consensus mechanism that is not threatened by front running, such as having all coordinators take turns.  Status  The 10% increment step has been removed, making the protable bid less obvious for front runners. However, since front running may still occur, we consider the issues partially resolved.

A missing return value bug may arise, leading to older tokens becoming locked on the contract when Zkopru needs to interact with them to withdraw. The Zkopru contract uses IERC20.sol, and if it interacts with a token that does not match IERC20 return values, there is a potential for the tokens to be locked in the contract.  To combat this possibility, the registration of a token in Zkopru must return a successful transfer trial. This can add a small amount of extra gas consumption and will block any older tokens that have a bad standard interface.

This token must get registered by passing the transfer checks so this may just result in the token being blocked from use in Zkopru.  Feasibility  Some tokens that are in use still adhere to a standard that does not return a value. A list of them is provided in the documentation on the missing return value bug.  Remediation  We recommend using a standard safe transfer wrapper, such as the one used by Uniswap or provided by OpenZeppelin, which will anticipate these interfaces with no return value and allow them to still be used.  Status  The safe transfer wrapper has been added to the Coordinatable.sol controller, thus eliminating the possibility of bad tokens being stuck.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

Synopsis  In the current implementation, the Zkopru contracts allow for the centrally owned operator to replace the SNARK circuit or the associated common reference string at any time. This SNARK circuit is used to verify shielded transactions. If this verication circuit is replaced with a malicious one, it will allow state updates that are malicious.  Impact  Severe. If the operator of the SNARK circuit becomes malicious or compromised, they are able to control all state updates. This can lead to the users losing all funds in the system.  Feasibility  In the early stages of the Layer 2 chain, it is against the self interest of the owner to commit fraud. However, this is a single point of failure that could become compromised through other attack methods.  Mitigation  While the SNARK circuits are still being nalized, it is favorable to be able to switch a broken circuit out quickly. Once the SNARK circuits have been nalized, the update function should be immediately switched to one controlled by a multisig contract.  Remediation  A democratic and transparent approach to the update of the consensus rules would be an ideal alternative to the currently centralized design. One way to do this would be to place a proposed circuit update on-chain where it could be voted on by the users of the system, or by those qualied to ensure that the new circuit is correct. SNARK circuits are complicated protocols and not easily reviewed by most people, so votes should be only placed on circuits that have been thoroughly audited by reliable and ethical sources.  Status  The setup phase of the smart contracts now renounces ownership on the OpenZepplen ownership smart contract.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

        "body": " Which Can Be Exploited For a DDoS Attack  Location  contracts/consensus/BurnAuction.sol#L108  coordinator/src/auction-monitor.ts#L207  Synopsis  In a burn auction, coordinators are required to set the URL when they join the auction. This URL/IP information is open to all coordinators. This enables a possible Distributed Denial of Service attack, in which a malicious coordinator can prevent the legitimate block proposer from proposing blocks and snatch the block proposing right without winning the burn auction.  Impact  A malicious coordinator can gain the block proposing right without being the winner in the burn auction or an attacker can prevent coordinators from proposing blocks to disrupt the system.  Preconditions  Assuming there are not many coordinators at the beginning of the system launch, an attacker can launch a DDoS attack against all coordinators during the block proposing round.  Feasibility  Highly likely, as winning the block proposal rights can be very competitive. The feasibility increases when there are fewer coordinators in an auction.  Technical Details  The coordinator is required to set their URL/IP with the auction smart contract when they join an auction. The smart contract will emit an event UrlUpdate once the coordinator sets the URL, and all coordinators  Security Audit Report | Zkopru zk-SNARK Circuits + Smart Contracts | Ethereum Foundation 22 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  26  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   who join the auction will have access to the coordinator URL/IP by subscribing to the UrlUpdate event. A malicious coordinator can use this information to launch a DDoS attack against the winning coordinator during the block proposing round (10 minutes at 15 sec/block), thus preventing them from proposing blocks. After half of the round passes then any other coordinator can propose, but an attacker could launch a DDoS attack against the other coordinators, especially when there are not many of them. As a result, the malicious coordinator gains the proposal rights without winning the auction.  Mitigation  Implement an incentive mechanism that can attract enough coordinators to participate in the system, and have multiple coordinators propose the block during the block proposing round to ensure that, if one block proposer is attacked, another coordinator can still proceed with proposing the block. After half of the round has passed, any other coordinator can propose a block (since it is harder for the attacker to attack all other proposers). Additionally, we recommend that the Zkopru team investigate possible DDoS protections for coordinators to implement.  Remediation  Remove the URL/IP information requirements for coordinators to join the auction, using some anonymous routing protocol (Tor, I2P, Raven e.g.) to protect coordinator network metadata privacy (IP and its link to on-chain ID) from deanonymization attacks.  Status  The Zkopru team has responded stating that a browser wallet will be deployed on a subdomain of zkopru.network and the coordinators will only accept HTTP requests from the whitelisted domains. However, DDos attacks can still send non HTTP requests/data (e.g. SYN) to ood the coordinators bandwidth. As a result, we consider this issue to be partially resolved.

However, additional tests to account for potential edge cases would help to further protect against malicious actions and unexpected behavior  Smart Contracts  The smart contracts include test coverage that is limited to success cases (when the slash condition is false), and does not incorporate failures and errors. Furthermore, each validator should have corresponding tests (e.g. withdrawtreeValidator, NullifierTreeValidator, DepositValidator and UtxoTreeValidator), which are currently insucient.  Security Audit Report | Zkopru zk-SNARK Circuits + Smart Contracts | Ethereum Foundation 22 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  27  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Increasing test coverage with specic attention to fail cases will help identify simple errors and prevent functionality from breaking when new code changes are introduced. In addition, tests help to detect and prevent unintended behavior and edge cases, which may result in the potential vulnerabilities.  Mitigation  Circuits  We recommend increasing test coverage to account for potential edge cases and unexpected behavior.  Smart Contracts  We recommend increasing test coverage for fail cases (e.g. slashable condition) and for all validator contracts.  Status  The Zkopru team has responded that they have provided additional tests and are currently onboarding new developers so they expect test coverage to increase in the near term. At the time of this verication, test coverage continues to be insucient.  Verication  Unresolved.  Suggestion 3: Expand System Documentation  Location  https://docs.zkopru.network/v/burrito  Synopsis  The project documentation provides an overview of the Zkopru system and the intended functionality for the smart contracts. However, the smart contracts interact with many off-chain components of the circuit system (e.g. coordinator, validator, SNARK verier, wallet client, fullnode, etc.) and these interactions are not comprehensively documented.  Furthermore, build and test documentation is missing and would provide a clear description of the setup process, which would avoid the potential for mistakes.  Insucient documentation of this nature leads to diculty understanding, reviewing, and using the system effectively.  Mitigation  We recommend creating detailed documentation of how the entire system interacts, which would provide a deeper appreciation and understanding of Zkopru. In addition, we recommend providing build and test documentation, which would prevent the potential for issues to arise during the initial setup phase.  Status  The Zkopru team has responded that the documentation would be updated before their launch to mainnet. At the time of this verication, this suggestion remains unresolved.

Example 2 demonstrates an instance of two lines of code that are different but perform an identical function.  Code duplication should be avoided, as it increases storage costs and can lead to misunderstandings when making changes to and reviewing code.

Suggestion 5: Update Compiler Version  Location  zkopru/controllers/Challengeable.sol  Synopsis  The compiler version is set to version 0.6.12, which does not incorporate newer compiler xes and updates.  Mitigation  We recommend updating the compiler version to 0.7.0\u20130.7.4. While more recent versions exist, we advise against their use as they may contain a higher probability of unknown issues.  Status  The compiler has been updated to v0.7.4. Since the time of the original report, there has been more time for compiler versions to settle. We recommend going as high as 0.8.0 if desired to achieve the new features such as EVM safe math and to regularly update the compiler to up to date, stable versions.  Verication  Resolved.

Suggestion 6: Add Address Input Sanitization  Location  zkopru/controllers/Coordinatable.sol#L41  Synopsis  There are two ways to enter stake to the coordinator contract. If calling register(), the address will be hardcoded to be msg.sender and there will be no issue. However, if stake() is called directly, the address input is never examined for format correctness.  Mitigation  We recommend adding a check to the address coordinator input for at least NULL address with require(coordinator != address(0));.

In the event that they are not planned to be implemented, a comment associated with each TODO explaining the rationale would benet from security review.  Mitigation  Complete TODOs or add documentation as to why they are unnecessary.

To check the security of the system as a whole, these would require a security audit.  Mitigation  We recommend that audits of the off-chain components, including the coordinator, wallet client, validator, SNARK verier, transaction builder and synchronizer, are undertaken to check for potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the interaction of the components function as intended.  Status  The Zkopru team has responded that, given that Zkopru is an optimistic rollup protocol, everything should be guaranteed on-chain. Off-chain components are only the implementation and they do not have any plans to have them audited.  Verication  Unresolved.

For more information about our security consulting, please visit https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/.  Our Methodology  We like to work with a transparent process and make our reviews a collaborative effort. The goals of our security audits are to improve the quality of systems we review and aim for sucient remediation to help protect users. The following is the methodology we use in our security audit process.  Manual Code Review  In manually reviewing all of the code, we look for any potential issues with code logic, error handling, protocol and header parsing, cryptographic errors, and random number generators. We also watch for areas where more defensive programming could reduce the risk of future mistakes and speed up future audits. Although our primary focus is on the in-scope code, we examine dependency code and behavior when it is relevant to a particular line of investigation.  Vulnerability Analysis Our audit techniques included manual code analysis, user interface interaction, and whitebox penetration testing. We look at the project's web site to get a high level understanding of what functionality the software under review provides. We then meet with the developers to gain an appreciation of their vision of the software. We install and use the relevant software, exploring the user interactions and roles. While we do this, we brainstorm threat models and attack surfaces. We read design documentation, review other audit results, search for similar projects, examine source code dependencies, skim open issue tickets, and generally investigate details other than the implementation. We hypothesize what vulnerabilities may be present, creating Issue entries, and for each we follow the following Issue Investigation and Remediation process.  Documenting Results We follow a conservative, transparent process for analyzing potential security vulnerabilities and seeing them through successful remediation. Whenever a potential issue is discovered, we immediately create an Issue entry for it in this document, even though we have not yet veried the feasibility and impact of the issue. This process is conservative because we document our suspicions early even if they are later shown to not represent exploitable vulnerabilities. We generally follow a process of rst documenting the suspicion with unresolved questions, then conrming the issue through code analysis, live experimentation, or automated tests. Code analysis is the most tentative, and we strive to provide test code, log captures, or screenshots demonstrating our conrmation. After this we analyze the feasibility of an attack in a live system.  Suggested Solutions We search for immediate mitigations that live deployments can take, and nally we suggest the requirements for remediation engineering for future releases. The mitigation and remediation recommendations should be scrutinized by the developers and deployment engineers, and successful mitigation and remediation is an ongoing collaborative process after we deliver our report, and before the details are made public.

Otherwise, an attacker might be able to use the  randomness_base  generator itself as an  asset_type  generator.   The Metastate team has stated that they are aware of this and have correctly accounted for it by  introducing the two different personalisations  VALUE_COMMITMENT_GENERATOR_PERSONALIZATION  and  VALUE_COMMITMENT_RANDOMNESS_PERSONALIZATION  for domain separation between the  asset_type  generators and the  randomness_base  generator. However, due to a small coding error,  the value  fixed_base_generators[FixedGenerators::Value CommitmentValue]  was  changed, such that it uses the wrong constant, while the value   Security Audit Report | Multi-Asset Shielded Pool | Metastate AG (Audit Funded by Tezos Foundation) 18 August 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   6   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.            fixed_base_generators[FixedGenerators::ValueCommitmentRandomness]  remains  unchanged.   Impact   If an attacker is able to compute a 32 byte preimage  A  of the  randomness_base  generator  R, then (A,R)  serves as a valid  asset_type  (identifier, generator)-pair with a known discrete log relation (the trivial  one) to the  randomness_base . This would break the binding property of the homomorphic Pederson  commitment.    Feasibility   The feasibility of the attack depends on the way in which the  randomness_base  generator is computed.  It is not of any practical concern, as long as the obvious preimage of the  randomness_base  generator is  not of size 32 byte (as explained in the Technical Details section), or if different personalizations are used.   Technical Details   According to function  group_hash in zcash_primitives/src/group_hash.rs , the  randomness_base generator is computed as:    Params::new()  .hash_length(32)  .personal(VALUE_COMMITMENT_GENERATOR_PERSONALIZATION)  .to_state().  .update(GH_FIRST_BLOCK)  .update(br)  .finalize()   Where GH_FIRST_BLOCK is 64byte and r is one byte. If we assume that the first BLAKE2s hash happens  to be a point on the Jubjub curve, then an asset_type generator is computed from its associated  asset_type identifier as:   Blake2sParams::new()  .hash_length(32)  .personal(VALUE_COMMITMENT_GENERATOR_PERSONALIZATION)  .to_state().  .update(identifier)  .finalize()   From this follows that, since  hash_state.update(A).update(B)  and  hash_state.update(A||B)  result in the same hash, the concatenated string  identifier:=(GH_FIRST_BLOCK||br)  is a valid  preimage of the randomness_base generator. However, that string is of size 65 byte, which violates the  assumption that an identifier must be of size 32 byte. Since the size of the identifier is checked in the  circuit, any identifier of size > 32 byte is invalid.   Remediation   Use the personalization  VALUE_COMMITMENT_RANDOMNESS_PERSONALIZATION  in the definition of  fixed_base_generators[FixedGenerators::ValueCommitmentRandomness] .

        "body": "    Location   https://github.com/joebebel/librustzcash/blob/joe/zcash_proofs/src/sapling/mod.rs#L35:L37   Synopsis   To compute the value balance in order to include it in the circuit, the value is computed in the exponent of  the value commitment generator. However, the cofactor is not cleared in function  compute_value_balance, which is necessary in this construction using the Jubjub curve.   Impact   By not having the cofactor cleared, it is possible that the system is vulnerable to a small subgroup attack,  which might leak three bits of information. Additionally, this leads to inconsistency in the codebase, as  well as inconsistency with the Sapling implementation, which might result in the inability to generate  correct proofs.    Technical Details   Due to the relation of the project to the Zcash Sapling circuit implementation and the use of the Jubjub  curve, it is helpful to also clear the cofactors of the generators created.   In modern cryptography, there exists a gap between provable security and practical cryptography. Within  cryptographic protocols and their implementations, it is often required to operate with elliptic curves of  prime order. In practice, used elliptic curves are not of prime order but have a low-order subgroup and a  high-order subgroup and the order of the whole group being of the form of  h*p  with  p  a large prime and  h  a small integer. The integer h is often called the cofactor. This can lead to a small subgroup attack as  presented by Lim and Lee .    In such groups,  G  with subgroup  H  of prime order  p  and order of  G  being  h*p  with  h  being a small  non-prime (i.e.,  h=r*s  with small prime  r ), there could exist an element P such that the order of P is  r*k  with integer  k . In  <P> , it would then be possible to solve the discrete logarithm problem. To make sure the  generator used in this case does not fall into  <P>  but rather into H, it is recommended to clear the  cofactor, meaning scalar multiplying  h*P  so that all resulting possible elements are actually cleared of  having the risk of small order.    This problem can also be identified for the Jubjub curve. The order of the Jubjub curve is  8*p  with prime  p , as a result, it is necessary to investigate the components for the generator in Jubjub and clear the  generator used in the protocol for computations of the value commitment.    Remediation   Clear the cofactor in function  compute_value_balance  for  value_commitment_generator  through  scalar multiplication with the cofactor.   It is also possible, for simplification, to have a potential  value_commitment_generator_uncleared  function without having the cofactor cleared and a  value_commitment_generator_cleared  function   Security Audit Report | Multi-Asset Shielded Pool | Metastate AG (Audit Funded by Tezos Foundation) 18 August 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   8   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.                with having the cofactor cleared in  zcash_primitives/src/primitives.rs  to clarify the usage instead of  clearing the cofactor manually where needed.    Status   The value balance calculation in  zcash_proofs/src/sapling/mod.rs  now clears the cofactor of the value  commitment generator.   Furthermore, in order to prevent errors in the future, the Metastate team is considering a type system for  uncleared and cleared generators, in addition to clearing cofactors as soon as possible, consistent  documentation of uncleared and cleared generators in the code, and changes to a consistent notation of  asset generator and value balance generator in documentation and code. However, these changes have  not been implemented.   Verification   Resolved.   ",

A malicious web page can load the extension in a hidden iframe while monitoring the navigator.clipboard object, leading to the exposure of a users secret key phrase when they are logged into the wallet.  Impact  An attacker can use the secret key phrase to initialize a different extension and take control of all the assets in the wallet.  Preconditions  The victim must be logged into the wallet while visiting a malicious page.

Feasibility  The attack is easy to create, although the user would need to visit the malicious site and perform a single action. Given that an attacker is highly incentivized, they would be motivated to reach as many potential victims as possible.

The clickjacking attack facilitates getting the key phrase into the clipboard. As a result, while it can be considered a stage in the overall attack, mitigating clickjacking attacks will not solve the problem of the key phrase being stored in the navigator.clipboard object.  Mitigation  Protection against clickjacking attacks is traditionally implemented by utilizing the X-Frame-Options HTTP Header. Since the extension pages are not loaded from an HTTP server, research by the Hiro team can be conducted to assess how this could be implemented in the context of a browser extension. Utilizing Content Security Policies (CSP) that prevent framing resources would be a possible solution.  To protect against the clipboard attack, it would be best to prevent the key phrase from ever being accessible to the clipboard available to the browser. One solution is to disable selection of the text and force users to download a le. Another option would be to investigate if the clipboard object can be disabled for that page entirely. This latter option might prove unfeasible, as users will want to be able to copy and paste addresses.  Status  This issue was reported to and discussed with the Hiro team during the audit. The Hiro team released a patch adding the frame-ancestors CSP direction, thus resolving this issue. Our team veried the changes and the clickjacking portion of the exploit is no longer possible.

        "body": "  Synopsis  Any extension installed on the users browser has access to privileged APIs that allow for the execution of arbitrary Javascript on a Blockstack application page that bypasses the SOP and gives access to sensitive application-specic data stored in local storage. This includes the transitKey, appPrivateKey, decentralizedID, and wallet address. The appPrivateKey is used for signing transactions as well as encrypting user application data on chain.  Impact  A successful attack of this type can result in de-anonymizing a user, decrypting data stored on chain, and forging JWT for use in other attacks (Issue E; Issue F).  Preconditions  Another browser extension is installed in the same browser where the Stack Wallet Extension is used. This can occur because either a user has installed a malicious extension or in the event that the browser was previously compromised and an extension was installed without their knowledge.  Feasibility  The attack is trivial to perform because any browser extension can be compromised in this way. Moreover, the potential for signicant reward motivates potential attackers to allocate resources to an attack of this type, or create browser extensions specically targeting typical users of the Stack Wallet Extension.  Security Audit Report | Stacks Wallet Extension | Hiro 29 April 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  12  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Technical Details  Chrome extensions have access to several privileged APIs that are not restricted by the SOP that otherwise sandboxes the domain. The chrome.tabs.executeScript() API can be leveraged from an extension to read local storage. With knowledge of a tabs ID gathered using the chrome.tabs.query() API, an extension can execute the following to steal the appPrivateKey for a particular TAB_ID:  chrome.tabs.executeScript(TAB_ID, {code: \"(function() {return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('blockstack-session')).userData.appPrivateKey })()\"},  (resp) => {  console.log(resp)})  Mitigation  Given the absence of a secure enclave in Chrome, attacks of this type are dicult to mitigate against. Solving this problem may prove exceedingly dicult in the current environment. However, exploitation requires a previous compromise of the browser thus largely depends on the end-users own security practices.  A mechanism to prevent this attack in the short-term would be to advise users to use dedicated browsers without extensions. If it is found to be possible to move the data stored in localstorage into the wallet sandbox, this could solve the exposure problem, but would then create new problems of how to build trust relationships between application and wallet code. We recommend this short-term mitigation and suggest that a longer term remediation be pursued in conjunction.  Remediation  As there is no clear remediation path, we recommend the Hiro team revisit their security architecture design (Suggestion 11) so it is a secure framework for constructing the application.  Status  The Hiro team has responded and acknowledged that they are aware of this issue. Given that remediating this issue would require considerable changes to the protocol design, they will continue to consider a long term strategy by revisiting their security architecture design and have stated their intent to  notify users of best practices (i.e. using a dedicated browser) when using Stacks applications. At the time of this verication, the suggested mitigation and remediation remain unresolved.  Verication  Unresolved.  ",

A more secure practice is to use a separate encryption key pair and to sign the corresponding public key using the signing key. Similarly, the  Security Audit Report | Stacks Wallet Extension | Hiro 29 April 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  13  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   appPrivateKey is used to both sign transaction request JWTs and encrypt application specic data on-chain.  Impact  In the event that encryption using the transit key is broken, the appPrivateKey would be leaked, severely undermining the security of the protocol.  In the event that signing using the appPrivateKey is broken, an attacker would be able to issue transaction requests.  In the event that encryption using the appPrivateKey is broken, an attacker would be able to decrypt encrypted on-chain application data.  Preconditions  The attacker would have to break the joint security of ECDSA and ECIES.  Feasibility  While [DLP+11] shows that the ECDSA and ECIES are jointly secure, the assumptions the security analysis is based upon are very strong. Therefore, the results of that paper do not provide the condence that is expected for this class of algorithm.  Technical Details  The discrete logarithm problem is the dicult problem underlying several cryptographic schemes, including most elliptic curve cryptography. This presents the possibility to reuse key material between different algorithms. However, it is not always clear whether this is secure practice. Additionally, different key uses often require different key lifecycles, which is not possible if the same key material is used. The fact that this need has not been identied as of yet does not mean that this is not an issue. Often, such requirements only come up as applications mature.  While there is a security proof available for the joint security of ECIES and ECDSA [DLP+11], the proof makes use of the random oracle model and the generic group model, both very strong (and therefore undesirable) assumptions.  Remediation  We recommend using distinct keys for signing and encryption, in addition to including the public key in the signed authentication request so the relation can be veried.

Synopsis  The secret key phrase is stored in the memory of the browser in cleartext. Attackers that are able to dump the memory of the extensions process will be able to steal the secret key phrase and take control of a wallet.  Impact  With knowledge of the secret key phrase, an attacker can instantiate a clone of the wallet and gain control of all of its assets.  Preconditions  An attacker will need to be able to dump the memory from the extensions process. This would require either physical access to the browser or a post-exploitation condition on the victims machine.  Feasibility  The attack is trivial to perform if the preconditions listed above are satised. Given the incentive for attackers, common malwares could incorporate a check to dump memory from browsers and search for strings in the format of a secret key phrase for exltration.  Technical Details  With the extension open in the browser, open Chrome Developer Tools, select Memory, click Take Snapshot, and then Save. With the downloaded le, run the strings command, and for quick results grep for a word in the secret key phrase to view in clear text.  Mitigation  While removing the key phrase from memory entirely is not possible, it is recommended that the key phrase be encrypted when not immediately in use, and that neither the encrypted key phrase nor encryption key be stored in a text format that will appear in the output of the strings command. We recommend using a binary object instead. While this would not prevent the key from appearing in a binary search, it would create signicant obstacles for an attacker to overcome.  Status  The Hiro teams current solution takes steps towards preventing the mnemonic from being easily identied in memory, but does not address the issue of the mnemonic being retrievable by running the strings command on a Heap Snapshot. By encoding as ASCII Hex, the mnemonic will now be identiable as being a   string beginning with 0x, and containing 12 or 24 space characters, identied as the byte 20 in Hex. Since ASCII   is easily converted into plaintext, this solution transfers the problem into a different encoding.  In order to implement a more robust mitigation, we recommend the following steps: In the stringToHex function, a binary buffer is created and then turned into a   string. If the toString(\u2018 ) method is omitted, the wallet would store the mnemonic in a binary buffer, which would have a different  Security Audit Report | Stacks Wallet Extension | Hiro 29 April 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  15  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   representation on the Heap than a string, and therefore unlikely to appear in the output of the strings command.

In the instance of transitKey, this is because it was only just generated (and could have potentially been generated by anyone). In the case of applicationSecretKey, this is because other extensions can read it from localStorage (see Issue B).  Additionally, the JWT signature is not validated when processing authentication transaction requests.  Impact  A malicious browser extension can take advantage of the wallet messaging system to invoke a transaction without knowledge of the appPrivateKey. If the user conrms the transaction, an incorrect JWT signature does not prevent the transaction from succeeding. This would allow an attacker to perform an attack against Issue F even in the absence of the vulnerability documented in Issue B.  Additionally, a malicious browser extension can inject itself into a Blockstack application, hijack the authentication UI, receive the appPrivateKey from the wallet extension, decrypt it, authenticate it to the wallet and exltrate the key.  Feasibility  Medium. An attacker does not need to provide a valid signature for the JWT, and can use the signature of an arbitrary request generated either in code or online. Malicious browser extensions will have access to the signing key, and can create a valid signature by using the jsontokens npm package.  Breaking sign-in using malicious authentication requests is not immediately possible due to messaging restrictions implemented using browser security mechanisms. These browser security mechanisms only protect against attacks coming from web pages. If the browser is in a post-compromise state, a malicious extension can easily bypass these restrictions.  Technical Details  The index.html#/transaction?request=<JWT> route in the extension takes a JWT in the request parameter. The message of the JWT is loaded into the extension popup as trusted data. While the presence of the JWT signature is required, it was found that the message body could be changed with arbitrary values without altering the signature with no impact on the success of the transaction.  Security Audit Report | Stacks Wallet Extension | Hiro 29 April 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  16  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.

Status  JWTs are now signed and internal components are checked for accuracy, with one exception related to the stxAddress. Validating signatures for transaction requests means that only parties with access to the appPrivateKey can create valid transaction requests. This issue is considered partially resolved as the exposure of the appPrivateKey to other extensions means that the parties with access to the key are still potentially unknown.

This occurs because the window.open() method will return a previously opened window if the window name is the same on subsequent calls. As the name of the extensions pop-up is hardcoded, the same popup window will always be overwritten with the latest transaction request.  Impact  An unsuspecting user may be tricked into conrming a transaction they did not intend, sending their coins to an attacker controlled address. The use of JWTs offer no protection against this attack as an attacker can create a valid JWT with the appPrivateKey (Issue B; Issue E).

Feasibility  Medium. A users browser must be in a post-compromise state with a malicious extension listening for DOM events and a user must not double check the transaction before conrming. Despite these mitigating circumstances, the incentive of a successful attack will motivate attackers to compromise browsers en masse.  Technical Details  A malicious extension can execute the following code to overwrite the popup window for an arbitrary JWT on the tab with identier TAB_ID.  let req = SOME_JWT;  let payload = 'function newReq() {'+  {detail:{transactionRequest: \"'+req+'\" }});'+  'evt = new CustomEvent(\"stacksTransactionRequest\",  'document.dispatchEvent(evt);'+  '}'+  'document.addEventListener(\"stacksTransactionRequest\", (evt) =>  chrome.tabs.executeScript(TAB_ID, {code: payload});  newReq());'  Remediation  We recommend appending a collision resistant hash to the window name used in the window.open() function.

A more cautious and precise approach would be to validate the consistency of the request, and then use the application domain explicitly specied in the authentication request.  Impact  While we did not identify a way to exploit this issue, a request that uses inconsistent URLs should be considered invalid and rejected, in order to guarantee that no part of the code can be subject to application domain confusion attacks.  Technical Details  The signicance of the application domain in the Stacks Wallet Extension is comparable to that of the origin in web applications. Confusing the access control systems of the Stacks Wallet Extension about this value may result in attacks where a malicious application poses as one application to parts of the extension. As a result, it is important to verify for consistency with the redirect URL and the manifest URL.  Remediation  We recommend verifying whether the URLs in the request are consistent and use the appDomain value as the application domain.

This class of algorithms has been advised against for several years due to negative security implications.  Impact  In this instance, the Stacks Wallet Extension may accept messages with a correct signature, created using a key under the control of the attacker.  Preconditions  The attacker needs to be able to circumvent other security restrictions on cross-tab messaging by the browser.  Feasibility  Attacks on browsers are not uncommon, but can usually be quickly patched. The feasibility mostly depends on the users update regimen and information from the development team.  Technical Details  It is feasible to signicantly speed up dictionary attacks on CPU bound hashes (e.g., using FPGAs) because the task is easily parallelizable. As a result, using CPU-bound key derivation for passwords has been advised against in favor of memory-hard functions like Argon2. These are more dicult to parallelize, because RAM and fast access to it is expensive to build in hardware.  Remediation  Argon2 comes in multiple variants optimized for different attack models, but the balanced Argon2id variant would be well suited in this instance. Section 4 of the Argon2 RFC provides a procedure for choosing good parameters for specic use cases.

In 2016, advances in number theory led to a lower security estimate for this curve. Specically, its security is now considered to be around 96-bits. This is signicantly lower than the 112-bits required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for new products.  Impact  Using the BN254 curve undermines the security of the zk-SNARK scheme, such that the feasibility of computing forged proofs that check as valid cannot be ruled out. Such proofs would pass validation, yet violate the constraints imposed by the circuit.  Preconditions  No preconditions are necessary.  Feasibility  The exact feasibility is dicult to estimate. However, the potential gains from a successful attack are high, which suggests that an attacker would have incentive to invest signicant resources.  Technical Details  Attacks based on the Tower Number Field Sieve (TNFS) and the derivatives exTNDS and SexTNFS have led to a reduced estimate of the security level of BN254. Scholars and practitioners working on this issue do not entirely agree on the new estimate, but opinions range from 96-bits to 110-bits ([KB15], [MSS16], [BD17], [Perrin16]). Regardless of where on this spectrum the actual value falls, it is still lower than the recommended minimum.

Groth16 produces preprocessing zk-SNARKs, and their security is based on the existence of a trusted third-party to compute the Common Reference String (CRS) in a preprocessing trusted setup phase.  In semaphore-rs, the correct use of the Groth16 zk-SNARK is critical for the unforgeability of the zk-SNARK in the semaphore protocol. The Semaphore protocol team mentions that they performed a trusted setup through Powers of Tau on May 29, 2022, for generating their CRS. The Worldcoin team uses the CRS generated by this trusted setup. Since this trusted setup is not performed by the Worldcoin team, and the implementation and execution of the Powers of Tau ceremony is not audited, a potential malicious party could have the ability to forge proofs.  In semaphore-mtb, a Groth16 zk-SNARK is being used for verifying the correctness of the Merkle tree update. All inputs to the zk-SNARK are public inputs and, therefore, the Merkle tree can also be constructed locally. In the current design of semaphore-mtb, the prover and the executor of the trusted setup are the same entity, which renders all proofs insecure. If the computation of the CRS is performed by a single party, that party has the ability to generate forged proofs about the correctness of the Merkle tree update.  Impact  For semaphore-rs: Since the Powers of Tau ceremony can potentially not be trusted, a malicious prover can forge proofs at will, which would be undetectable by any other party. As a result, any proof must be considered potentially forged.  For semaphore-mtb: As long as the prover is the only participant in the CRS generation, the prover can forge proofs at will, which would be undetectable by any other party. As a result, any proof must be considered potentially forged.

Preconditions  For semaphore-rs: The Powers of Tau ceremony by Semaphore must either be performed at fault or the implementation must be at fault.  For semaphore-mtb: The prover must be the only independent participant that contributes randomness to the initial trusted setup phase.  Feasibility  The attacks are straightforward and well-known.  Remediation  We recommend investing in the development of a proper multi-party computation (MPC) to generate the CRS and performing the multi-party computation in an independent manner. Proper and well-tested methods like the Powers of Tau [BGM17] are known and can be executed in a permissionless way.  In addition, the implementation of the Powers of Tau ceremony by Semaphore was out of scope for this audit. Although such an implementation is better than having the prover and executor of the trusted setup be the same entity, our team does not recommend using a Powers of Tau ceremony performed by a different project and instead recommends performing a trusted setup for the Worldcoin project specically.

Synopsis  During previous CRS-MPC ceremonies, such as the Zcash Sprout ceremony in 2016, considerable efforts were made by the Electric Coin Company team to secure the underlying hardware used to compute any contribution and reduce the likelihood that it could be compromised. However, if decentralized private computations become widespread, circuit specic CRS-MPCs like those required in Groth16 might become more common and occur frequently, particularly as circuits increase in size. As a result, it cannot be assumed that all ceremony participants will be able to put forth such considerable effort to ensure the integrity of the hardware and software will remain the same as it did for previous ceremonies.  Given this knowledge, we suggest in threat modeling, to assume that the machines involved in ceremonies may be compromised in some way. As a result, the Aleo codebase would benet from taking additional precautions to protect the random seed and the private key against a compromised system, the latter of which might be able to read or generate false secret randomness.  Impact  The overall impact is low, since the entire CRS-MPC is secure as long as at least one private key among all contributions remains a secret. However, in the unlikely event that an attacker is able to accumulate the secret randomness of all participants, it can compute false proofs in any system that is based on the derived CRS.  Preconditions  In order to read the seed or the private key, an attacker must compromise the executing machine in such a way that they are able to read or write from or to the process memory (e.g. RAM/SWAP). A second precondition would be a random number generator attack, in which the systems randomness generator is compromised in order to generate fake randomness.  Technical Details  In function key_generation in le /phase1/src/key_generation.rs, the private key (usually called the toxic waste or the secret eld elements) is deterministically derived from a seed that has to be provided as a parameter during program start. The seed and private_key then exist during the execution time of the function contribute in the le /phase1-cli/src/contribute.rs. However, depending on the circuit size, that function might run for an extended period, giving an attacker enough time to complete their attack. After termination, the associated memory is deallocated but not actively overwritten. Furthermore, no precautions have been taken to prohibit the compiler from allocating various copies of that secret in different parts of the memory, including less volatile parts (e.g. a swap partition).  Remediation  As long as any contribution is executed in a single chunk, there is no reason for the seed randomness to be generated outside of the function contribute. In this scenario, Rust's crate secret can be used as protected-access memory for the seed. This guarantees that the memory is both freed and overwritten after termination.  Unfortunately, if the contribution is provided across more than one chunk, the previously mentioned approach will not suciently address the issue since the secret randomness needs to be shared across different computations. As a result, we recommend a pre-contribution phase that generates the randomness inside Rusts crate secret and encrypts it using strong symmetric encryption and a user dened password, the latter of which is, for example, stored in an OS keyring or memorized by the user. The encrypted toxic waste can then be stored safely and used in the various chunk computations. In each computation, it is decrypted and then handled as we suggested under the single chunk computations.

Status  The Aleo team has responded that, since one non-compromised participant is sucient for security, they do not plan to resolve this issue.

This implies that no discrete logarithm relation between different oracle queries should be known to any user of the system. However, we found that the approach taken by the Aleo development team trivially exposes a discrete logarithm relation between any output and the generator.  Impact  Having knowledge of discrete logarithm relations between any output and the generator imply discrete logarithm relations between any two outputs, which in turn violates the assumptions of BGM17 on the independence of outputs. As a consequence, the security proof no longer holds true.  Feasibility  This is very feasible as the discrete logarithm relation is easy to compute.  Technical Details  Function hash_to_g2 calls function sample from le algebra-core/src/curves/models/short_weierstrass_jacobian.rs, which computes the hash to curve as follows:  Let g_2 be a generator of G2 and x be the byte string that needs to be hashed to G2. Then the curve hash is computed as,  H_G2(x) := g_2^Hash(x),  where Hash(.) is a cryptographically secure hash function that hashes to the base eld. The discrete log relation between H_G2(x) and g_2 is then trivially seen as Hash(x).  Remediation  A secure approach would be to hash separately to the x and the y coordinates and check if the result is actually a point in the required large order prime group. If it is not in the prime order subgroup, changing the initial byte string is necessary. Depending on the approach, proper cofactor clearing may also be necessary.  Security Audit Report | Trusted Setup: Phase 1 | Aleo 30 July 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Status  The Aleo team rewrote the hash_to_G2 function and implemented a try-and-increment approach for hashing into G1 of the twist in the usual way. This was done by rst hashing into the base eld, trying to nd a curve point, and then doing a cofactor multiplication to project into G1 of the twist. Since the twist isomorphism identies G1 of the twist with G2 of the original curve over the extension eld F_{q^k} with k being the embedding degree, this implements a way to hash into G2. We analyzed the implementation and were not able to identify any new issues. Thus, we consider the original issue to be resolved.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

Consequently, the system is not processing blocks, as they are written to the chain, to update its state. Instead, it is implementing a delay and reading a block once it has been conrmed 6 times, or since 5 more blocks have been written to the chain.  Block nality is a crucial mechanism for blockchain and bridge safety. According to the overview.md denition, EthBlockDelay - Is an agreed upon number of Ethereum blocks all oracle attestations are delayed by. The current value being considered is 50 blocks. However, the EthBlockDelay variable and its value are noted only once in the overview.md and the codebase does not utilize such a constant or variable.  In the coded implementation, the function is named get_block_delay and the description of the function justies that the block conrmation should be equal to 6 blocks for Ethereum mainnet. The implementation also contains the following statement: The value used here for Ethereum is a balance between being reasonably fast and reasonably secure. A 6 block nality threshold for Ethereum mainnet is the absolute minimum and could potentially be ineffective in preventing race conditions and double spend attacks.  Impact  A low threshold of block conrmation could result in race conditions and double spend attacks against the Gravity Bridge, which could prevent the system from functioning as intended and lead to the loss of funds.  Feasibility  Since the Ethereum blockchain does not have a nality property, and reorganizations and forks occur regularly, attacks targeting non-repudiation properties are feasible if the number of block conrmations is low.  Remediation  We recommend increasing the block delay value for the Ethereum Mainnet to 12 blocks [R19], in adherence with best practice. We also recommend reconsidering block delay values for other testnets in scope.  Status  The Althea team has increased the block delay value to 13 blocks.

The code should throw an error if any of these exceeds 64 bits, which is already being done for events like TransactionBatchExecutedEvent and SendToCosmosEvent.  Impact  In the le orchestrator/gravity_utils/src/types/ethereum_events.rs, the events emitted from the Ethereum blockchain are parsed to decode the type of the event and the individual elds as a part of the event. Therefore, this implementation is critical to conrm that the events are correctly parsed. There is no existing Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) unpacking implementation. Thus, it is crucial for the methods in this le to work as expected.  For events like Erc20DeployedEvent and ValsetUpdatedEvent, a failure to check if the event nonce and the block height are valid 64-bit numbers could lead to unexpected behavior.

Preconditions  An attacker creates a session with a victims one-time key and sends a pre-key message containing an invalid encrypted ciphertext.  Technical Details  In create_inbound_session, the receiving party receives a pre-key message, in which it looks for the private part of its one-time key and decodes the remote one-time key, the remote identity key, from which together with the private part of its one-time key derives a shared secret which computes the root key and chain key. Finally, the one-time key is removed.  However, the ciphertext in the pre-key message is not decrypted in accordance with the Olm specication. Consequently, an attacker can create a pre-key message with an invalid ciphertext (e.g. encrypted with an incorrect message key derived from an incorrect chain key).

Impact  An attacker can decrypt past messages that were encrypted by a key derived from the compromised earliest ratchet value (initial_ratchet) or subsequent ratchet values.  Preconditions  An attacker captures the initial_ratchet in a Megolm inbound group session.  Remediation  We recommend implementing a permanent and explicit way to remove previous ratchet state values in the Megolm inbound group session. The user of the library should be able to choose to remove or advance the previous initial ratchet value up to a more recent value.  Status  The Matrix team has added a function, advance_to, in inbound group sessions to permanently advance the session ratchet value to the given index. This removes the ability to decrypt messages that were encrypted with a lower message index than what is given as the argument.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

        "body": " Side-Channel Attacks  Synopsis  If the attacker has access to the users swap space or can mount side-channel attacks, they may have access (usually unreliable) to the memory of arbitrary processes, including those making use of vodozemac. Since keys are not protected while in memory, this may compromise their security.  Security Audit Report | vodozemac | Matrix 30 March 2022 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  13  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Impact  This could result in leakage of secret keys, including identity keys, ephemeral keys (i.e. one-time keys or pre-keys), ratchet keys, as well as encryption and authentication keys. This in turn would undermine the condentiality and authenticity properties of Olm and Megolm.  Preconditions  The attacker has access to the swap of a user or the machine and operating system (OS) of the user is susceptible to side-channel attacks that undermine process separation.  Feasibility  The attacker would have to nd the keys in the pieces of the memory extracted. A successful attack depends on the specic system and the amount of data to be extracted. The attack is not straightforward, but possible in many circumstances.  Technical Details  Swap refers to space on the SSD/HDD reserved to store data that resides in memory while it is not needed. On some systems, it is also used for keeping the memory contents during hibernation (also known as suspend-to-disk), which means that memory contents are written to disk, where an adversary may have access to it.  Side-channel attacks describe a wide range of attacks. In this context, we specically refer to attacks like Meltdown and Spectre and Rowhammer, which allow one process to access memory regions allocated to another process with moderate accuracy.  Mitigation  We recommend the Matrix team further employ the mitigations implemented by OpenSSH. Here, keys are encrypted while not in use, using a key derived from a 16kB buffer lled with random data, only decrypted when needed and immediately disposed afterwards (i.e. zeroized). This hinders attackers, because they not only need to acquire the keys, but also the 16kB pre-key region in order to decrypt them. Since the probability of a read error increases as the amount of read data grows, having to read signicantly more data effectively reduces the success probability of this class of attacks.  In addition, users of applications using vodozemac should ensure that the operating system they use employs all available mitigations against attacks from the Spectre and Meltdown families. Additionally, they should make sure that they either do not use swap at all, or congure their system such that it is encrypted.  Status  The Matrix team has acknowledged the suggested mitigation would provide enhanced security, however, they have stated they will not implement the mitigation until a future date.

Synopsis  In the vodozemac implementation, HMAC-SHA256 tags are truncated to 8 bytes (i.e. 64 bits). However, according to the HMAC specication, they may only be truncated to half of the length of the underlying hash (128 bits in this case). Thus, the current implementation violates the recommendations from the HMAC specication.  Impact  An insucient tag length weakens the authentication scheme, which increases the probability of successfully modifying a ciphertext.  Preconditions  The attacker must be able to impersonate a sender on the underlying insecure channel. In the Matrix setting, home servers are able to perform such attacks.  Feasibility  The probability of an attacker guessing a tag for which the verication succeeds is relatively high probability, compared to those in other cryptographic settings. However, an attacker only gets one guess per message, so a brute-force attack is not possible with just one message.  , which is a  2  \u221264  Technical Details  A MAC tag allows the receiver to verify that the received data comes from the intended receiver (assuming the two are the only parties with access to the key). If the MAC tag becomes shorter, it becomes easier to guess the tag for which the validation succeeds. Typically, in cryptographic operations the security target of about 128 bits is chosen, and most parts of the system do in fact achieve it.  The truncation of the MAC reduces the security target to only 64 bits, falling short of best practices.  Remediation  We recommend updating the code to truncate to not less than 16 bytes or not at all. We acknowledge that this would require a protocol change, which is not unilaterally possible by the Matrix team in order to maintain compatibility with the larger Matrix ecosystem.  Status  The Matrix team responded that while they agree that modern security targets should be met, the changes in truncation of the MAC are inherited from the libolm implementation and would require a coordinated effort on the Matrix Protocol level to ensure compatibility between implementations. Additionally, the Matrix team assesses the probability of an attack resulting from the truncation of a MAC to 8 bytes as low.  We agree with the assessment by the Matrix team and understand that a change of the Matrix Protocol would be required for remediation of this issue. Nonetheless, we recommend coordinating a protocol change within the Matrix ecosystem and updating the MAC truncation.  Verication  Unresolved.

As such, we  must assume that the numbers may have been chosen in a way such that they have properties that open  up a security vulnerability that is only exploitable by the party generating the numbers. A  script  to generate  the parameters was found, however, it returns different numbers from those used in the code. Instead,  nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers should be used.    Security Audit Report | Mina Ledger Application | O(1) Labs 5 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Impact   It may be possible for the Mina team to find hash collisions or second preimages in a reasonable amount  of time. Since the hashes are used in a signature scheme, breaking the hash function may allow forging  signatures.    Preconditions   In order for the attack to be possible, the numbers must have been chosen in a particular way. There is no  evidence that this is the case, but there is also no evidence that it is not.   Feasibility   The attacker would need significant knowledge of the Poseidon hash function and the mathematics  behind it. The amount of computational complexity required for the attack is unclear to our team.   Technical Details   Poseidon is a SNARK-friendly hash function. It executes in multiple rounds and in each round it performs  computations based on a set of constants. These should be close to random. However, it should also be  verifiable that these numbers have not been chosen to undermine the security of the algorithm. This is  usually done by generating the numbers using hashes or pseudorandom functions, based on short strings  that describe the use, and do not provide room for the party generating the constants to introduce bias.   While we did find a script in another repository of Mina, we have not been able to verify that the numbers  match.    Remediation   If the numbers are already generated in a verifiable manner, this should be clearly documented and made  easy to verify that the numbers are those present in the code.   Should the numbers not be generated in a verifiable manner, a nothing-up-my-sleeve generation scheme  should be used to make the generation verifiable. For example, the designers of Poseidon chose a  scheme based on the  Grain cipher . The description of their algorithm can be found in appendix F of the  Poseidon paper .    Status   Following further discussion with the Mina team, we determined this to be a non-issue. Our team was able  to verify that the numbers used are generated such that they can be verified to be random. Previously, we  compared the actual ARC values with the generated MDS matrix values. With further clarification from the  Mina team, we compared ARC constants to the generated ARC constants and were able to successfully  conduct the verification.    However, we recommend that the Mina team simplify the verification process (See  Suggestion 5 ). During  our review, we found that the existing script prints poorly formatted Rust code, which is not accepted by  rustfmt. We had to employ a semi-manual process that included writing custom code to make comparing  the values to those in  src/poseidon.c  feasible. The process for verifying that the parameters were  generated honestly should be streamlined by adding a script will simplify the verification process. This  will make it easier for reviewers, developers, and contributors to verify the system is working as expected.   Verification   Resolved.

Synopsis  The method chosen to record the balances held by the LoanCore.sol smart contract is to check the smart contracts balance after a transfer has occurred, forcing the smart contract to update the state of a balance after a call to the ERC-20 token smart contract has been made. This results in a possibility for a corrupt ERC-20 token to be used to re-enter the loan creation process. As good practice, the check-effects-interactions pattern should be used at all times.  Impact  Using a corrupt ERC-20 token to re-enter the loan creation process allows many invalid loans to be stored on the smart contract originating from the same loan terms agreement. However, the impact of this is likely negligible and would only cost the attacker.  Feasibility  Given that we could not determine an incentive for this attack, we consider this attack to be unlikely.  Remediation  We recommend using the loan state data, data.terms.principal, to update and record the balances. This will allow the LoanCore.sol smart contract to prevent an ERC-20 transfer from re-entering on line 110, since the received amount would now be updated.  Status  The Pawn Finance team refactored the code in LoanCore.sol to follow a stronger checks-effects-interactions pattern by moving the token transfer until after the token balance is updated (now on Line 119).  Upon review of the pull request where the above changes were made, the Pawn Finance team noted an issue with Fee on Transfer tokens and other tokens with nonstandard handling of transfers, causing the potential to miscalculate their internal balance. The Pawn Finance team decided to replace the previous way of updating balances, by pushing them into a mapping, with the use of transferFrom and safeTransfer patterns.

This loan terms agreement is then used to create a loan. This agreement is signed by either the borrower or the lender off-chain. It is required that the counterparty of the agreement then broadcast the transaction on-chain, effectively signing the agreement themselves. There is no nonce in the agreement signed, meaning that if multiple iterations of the agreement are signed by one party, the other may broadcast an older version of the agreement.  Security Audit Report | Pawn Smart Contracts | Pawn Finance 27 August 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  6  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Impact  If a loan terms agreement is iterated off-chain, an older agreement might be used by a counterparty causing a loan to be started that a counterparty did not intend to be started, resulting in one of the parties carrying suboptimal loan terms.  Feasibility  The feasibility of this attack could not be assessed from the scope of this audit. The case of multiple iterations of loan terms agreements may be limited in possibility.  Mitigation  The Pawn Finance team has responded to this issue noting that this case should not be possible due to application code. However, we assert that application code can be bypassed on-chain, and a bug or incorrect usage of the protocol may result in an issue. The Pawn Finance team also responded that there is no conceivable incentive to perform a replay attack unless a mistake is made during the iteration of a loan terms agreement. Our team is not able to conrm this assertion.  The decentralized approach to solving this issue involves using a nonce on agreements and requiring a delay in the start of a loan for a counterparty to challenge an old loan agreement being used. This is not a trivial design and we do not suggest that this be implemented.  We recommend that the application warn users when they sign a loan terms agreement that this action is irreversible and that no further iterations of the agreement should be made. If a loan agreement must be updated off-chain, it should be known that there is no guarantee that the older signed agreement will not be used to start a loan.

Security Audit Report | Pawn Smart Contracts | Pawn Finance 27 August 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.

In a scenario where a loan is originated on-chain unexpectedly later than the off-chain negotiation of terms, a borrower would have a reduced time frame to repay a loan.

        "title": "Issue A: Flash Loan Attack (Known Issue)",
        "body": "   Location   /contracts/strategies/curve/CRVStrategyStable.sol     Synopsis   Using a flash loan, a contract is able to make a Harvest deposit while also manipulating the share price of  the underlying token, and then withdraw the deposit to make a profit, and steal from the other depositors  via the Harvest buffer.   Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   7   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Impact   Funds can be manipulated and withdrawn. A previous flash loan attack on Harvest Finance, which  occured on 26 October 2020, resulted in the theft of $33.6 million worth of funds, representing 3% of the  total value in the Harvest Finance protocol.   Preconditions   Harvest Finance supports strategies that invest in DeFi protocols whose price can be manipulated by a  flash loan.   Feasibility   Attacks utilizing flash loans are sometimes easy, depending on the approach taken, and interactions  between Harvest Finance and the DeFi protocol used by a strategy. As the Harvest Smart Contracts  incorporate other DeFi protocols, it is possible that new flash loan attacks will become feasible.   Technical Details   With the previous flash loan attack, the attacker took out a flash loan, and used it to acquire a large  amount of USDC and USDT. They then converted the USDT to USDC inside the curve yPool, increasing the  price of USDC within yPool. The attacker then deposited a large amount of USDC into Harvest Finance.  Due to the inflated price of USDC at the time, the share price relative to USDC had lowered and the  attacker obtained slightly more shares than usual. They then reversed their swap of USDT back to USDC  and withdrew from Harvest Finance. Since the USDC price had now returned to normal and the share  price increased, they were able to sell the shares back for slightly more than they brought them. This extra  amount was paid from the Harvest Finance buffer.   Remediation   Existing Remediation: Price Checkpointing   These attacks require a flash loan, which depends on multiple technical aspects of Ethereum  contracts, in addition to the ability to manipulate Vault share prices and get a positive financial  return. In response to the previous attack, the Harvest Finance team has designed the  remediation strategy described in the  Vault redesign document . When calculating a share  value, instead of using the current price (which may be manipulated via a flash loan), the  system compares the current price with the last price checkpoint and uses the minimum of the  two in the withdraw function and the maximum of the two prices in the deposit function. This  means that a price manipulation will not affect the share price. A flash loan will lose money, fail  to be repaid, and be reverted.    We agree that the Vault redesign should be sufficient to prevent flash loans from being used  against Harvest Finance. However, as noted in the  Vault redesign document , it negatively  affects user experience in that it causes a delay in transactions or a discrepancy in price:   As a consequence of the virtual price calculation, if an honest user deposits funds into a vault,  they should wait for at least one  doHardWork()  call before withdrawing, otherwise they will notice  a slight discrepancy between the deposited amount and the amount withdrawn.     Consequently, honest users would need to be aware of price checkpointing being used, in order to avoid  being subject to price discrepancies between the times in which  doHardWork  is called.   After exploring the issue during our review, we suggest several alternative ways flash loans could be  prevented in purely technical, non-economic ways, as detailed below.    Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   8   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.            Alternative Potential Remediations   Restrict all contracts   The first possibility is to restrict all contracts, disallowing the use of a contract to invest in Harvest  Finance. A flash loan can only be made out to a contract and not an Externally Owned Account (EOA)  because the flash loan calls back to the recipient, who must repay the loan before it returns. An EOA can  call EVM functions but cannot itself be called, thus it is unable to receive flash loans except by deploying  a contract. While this remediation would prevent flash loan attacks, creating a system where no one can  use a contract to invest in Harvest Finance may be seen as too severe a limitation.   Two-step process   A second strategy is to target the synchronicity attribute of flashs loans, specifically, that they must be  repaid before the flash loan call returns. If a contract is not able to both deposit and withdraw within a  single transaction, it would be impossible to repay the flash loan, causing it to be reverted. In a  post-mortem blog post about the attack , the Harvest Finance team suggested using a commit-and-reveal  mechanism for deposits. In this case, a user would transfer funds into Harvest Finance in a single step  and then claim it in the next. As the Harvest Finance team points out, this has the negative side effect of  changing the user experience and API by requiring two transactions, as well as increasing gas costs.   However, simply requiring that a deposit and a withdrawal are in two separate blocks would interrupt  flash loans in the same way, but with the positive benefit of not altering the user experience. To  implement this method of resistance to a flash loan, a contract could keep a map of the address to the  block height of the last interaction with the contract and whether it was a deposit or withdrawal. If the  previous interaction was before the current block height, then the call is allowed to proceed, but if the  previous interaction equals the current block height, then the transaction is reverted. By requiring the  withdrawal after the deposit to be made in at least the next block, it will be impossible to use the contract  via a flash loan.   Return Funds At Deposit Price If Withdrawn Before  doDardWork  Call   Alternatively, there is another way to interrupt flash loans to prevent an attack. If the deposited funds are  withdrawn before  doHardWork  is called, it makes sense to simply return the funds at the price paid on  deposit. With a flash loan (or other price manipulation attacks), the deposit is made, then the attacker  performs a price manipulation, and then withdraws. Prior to calling  doHardWork , these funds are sitting  in the Vault and they have not done any  work.  If they are withdrawn before the funds have done anything,  they can simply be returned at the same price.    In the edge case where attackers deposit funds in multiple transactions during price changes but before  calling  doHardWork , a simple solution would be to record the price as the average of the two prices paid,  weighted by the amounts brought in each time. This is a simple calculation:    price_new = (price1*deposit1+price2*deposit2)/(deposit1+deposit2)    deposit_new = deposit1+deposit2    If they then withdraw both deposits, it is done at  price_new , and they get the same amount back as if  they had withdrawn  deposit1  before they made  deposit2 . Although it might seem necessary to record  this in a complicated data structure, this should be avoided in Ethereum contracts. The important thing is  that any funds that do not enter the actual DeFi exchange are withdrawn at the same price.   Verification   While we agree that the currently implemented price-checkpoint remediation should prevent flash loan  attacks, we recommend considering this last remediation option. By returning the funds at the price paid   Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   9   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        at deposit, it makes an attack uneconomical. The simplicity of using this price would not introduce the  complexities of determining legitimate and illegitimate prices, and without impacting the user experience  as a two step process requires. Furthermore, contracts depositing and withdrawing in the same  transaction would still work, but neither making a profit nor a loss.   Status   Not Applicable. The Harvest Finance team has informed us they have discontinued the strategies which  were vulnerable to price manipulations and have reverted to a previous code design that was out-of-scope  for our review. As a result of this decision, the code that is currently running in production has not been  audited by our team and we recommend it be reviewed for the presence of this or similar issues.    ",

        "body": "   Synopsis   We believe this type of attack first surfaced in the form of front-running attacks against exchanges. The  creator of  Uniswap  has coined this  The Dark Forest  of Ethereum, where transaction ordering and the  public nature of the blockchain create front-running buy and sell attacks. In the context of Harvest  Finance, a sandwich attack is an attempt to manipulate prices and commit a similar attack to  Issue A  by  manipulating the price before  and  after the call to  doHardWork  (which encompasses the price  checkpoint), thus \"sandwiching\" the  doHardWork  transaction. Even if a remediation to  Issue A  prevents  price manipulations within a single transaction, it is still possible that one is performed over multiple  transactions.   As flash loans should no longer be possible after the  existing remediation  was implemented for  Issue A ,  the actor carrying out a successful sandwich attack needs to be a whale, that is, a market participant  with enough funds to make large transactions that move the market on their own. The whale knows about  these market movements ahead of other participants because they create them. Therefore, they can  profit from them by taking funds from other participants.    Impact   Funds can be manipulated and withdrawn.   Preconditions   A price checkpoint based mitigation to flash loans has been implemented and the attacker has enough  funds to move the market on their own.   Feasibility   This attack is feasible if the attacker has a large amount of funds and sufficient understanding of the  system. From the point of view of the attacker, there is also a risk associated with a sandwich attack,  which is not present in the case of a flash loan based attack. There are typically no guarantees that the  sandwich attack will not lose funds to arbitrage bots, since attacks cannot be conducted in the safety of  one transaction if the remediation in  Issue A  is in place. The attacker must broadcast a transaction that  gets mined before the  doHardWork  call and, since miners order transactions by gas price, this is as  simple as using a higher gas price. They must also make a second transaction with a lower gas price (and  there is a risk for them there that transactions will get chosen by miners instead).   Technical Details   With the price checkpoint remediation to  Issue A , a new price checkpoint is set when  doHardWork  is  called. A sandwich attack can be successful if an attacker is able to insert a price manipulation after this  transaction is observed but before it is mined, and then append another transaction that takes advantage  of the manipulation that is mined soon after the  doHardWork  transaction. The actual attack transactions   Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   10   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          would be similar to those used in  Issue A , with the only difference being that they are performed in  separate transactions, one inserted before the  doHardWork  call which sets the price checkpoint, and one  appended as soon as possible after it.   Mitigation   The Harvest Finance team has implemented a mitigation to this attack with a  New Vault Design , using a  price hint that is passed to the  doHardWork  call on the  Controller  contract. When calling  doHardWork , an expected price and acceptance ratio is checked, and if the measured price at the time  the contract is mined is outside that price by more than the acceptable ratio, then the transaction is  reverted. The price hint and ratio is chosen by Harvest governance before making the call. If there is an  unexpected change in price before the transaction is mined, it will be reverted. Thus, the most the attacker  could achieve is causing the doHardWork call to revert.   We consider this a mitigation (and not a remediation) because it reduces the impact but does not  eliminate the problem. Because an acceptance ratio is used, an attacker may still profit if their attack is  small enough. The  documented flash loan attack  used only a 1% price manipulation, while still extracting  a large amount, so this seems possible. This mitigation also has the downside that Harvest Finance now  carries the responsibility to approve prices. Choosing an acceptance ratio that is too small makes it easy  to block  doHardWork  (see  Issue C ), but choosing an acceptance ratio that is too high will make it easier  to make small but still profitable manipulations.   To strengthen this mitigation, it may be worth considering making the  doHardWork  call with a low gas  price. Paradoxically, this will make it more difficult to sandwich. It will still be easy to insert a transaction  before the doHardWork call, however, appending a transaction after it becomes more risky. Most  Ethereum users prefer to save money using the average gas price. If there are many other transactions in  the mempool using the same price, it becomes harder to insert the bottom layer of the sandwich. If  miners must choose between many transactions, then it's possible that transaction is bumped to the next  block. This significantly increases the arbitrage risk for the attacker.   Remediation   Direct Withdrawals   Another approach to fixing the sandwich attack would be to avoid tracking the price entirely. In the  Harvest Finance  post mortem blog post , a design is discussed whereby instead of calculating a share  price based on the current market price, the user simply withdraws the underlying asset and then  exchanges it themselves. By not involving the price, this completely avoids price manipulations. Notably,  this approach would be a very significant change to Harvest Finance.   This remediation could be improved by automating the exchange, but by using the actual exchange  contract rather than calculating an exchange rate. The documented attack used 17 million units to  manipulate the price, causing a 1% price manipulation, then withdrew 50 million units. However, if this 50  million unit withdrawal went through the actual exchange contract, it would have just caused another  price manipulation in the opposite direction. The outcome would depend on how the DeFi exchange in  question operates, but it would likely not be profitable for the attacker.    Random ordering of Ethereum transactions   The sandwich attack is possible because the ordering of Ethereum transactions is deterministic.  Transactions are selected by highest gas price, and then ordered from highest to lowest price in the  block. This makes front running possible. If miners chose to order transactions randomly, it would not be  possible to perform this attack, except as a miner. The ordering of transactions is not fixed in the  Ethereum specification, it is simply the default behavior of the clients to order them from highest to  lowest price. Changing this would not require a hard fork, but it would require campaigning to have this   Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   11   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        change made to clients and adopted by miners. This would prevent sandwich attacks for Harvest Finance,  and also eliminate front running attacks for a large number of Ethereum contracts. This is not a short  term fix, but it is also not mutually exclusive to the mitigation already implemented or the direct  withdrawal remediation suggested above.    Verification   We understand that possibly neither of these suggested remediations are immediately viable for the  Harvest Finance team, however, we encourage these to be considered as the system and the DeFi  ecosystem on Ethereum continue to grow.    Status   Not Applicable.

        "title": "Issue C: Price Checkpoint DoS",
        "body": "   Location    /contracts/Controller.sol#L56-L76    Synopsis   This issue arises from the mitigation strategy of the  Vault redesign  for sandwich attacks, specifically the  Controller  contract calling  doHardWork  and the control over the expected slippage of price from the  Controller . If an attacker is able to predict the acceptable slippage of the  Controller , they may  attempt to front-run every  Controller  call to  doHardWork . The attacker must manipulate the price of  the assets such that the  Controller  transaction will revert for being outside of the acceptable limit. The  governance of Harvest Finance will attempt to reduce the allowed slippage percentage as much as  possible to prevent high slippage manipulations, but in doing so, they will make it easier to block  doHardWork  price checkpoints by making the percentage of slippage small and minimizing the amount  of manipulation needed to block the call.   Impact   An incorrect recorded price for an extended period of time could cause any deposits after the attack to be  withdrawn at an incorrect rate. However, if the  last remediation that we propose in Issue A  is  implemented, there will no longer be a price checkpoint that a DoS attack can affect. Such an attack  would only block the call to  doHardWork , which should reduce the profitability of engaging in a  checkpoint DoS attack.   Preconditions   The attacker must be able to front-run the  Controller s attempt to call  doHardWork . They must also  be able to manipulate the market to place the price hint outside of an acceptable range. Additionally, they  must be able to tolerate potential losses due to arbitrage for manipulating the price many times in a row.   Feasibility   While this attack is feasible, it presents risks to the attacker that may make it much more difficult to carry  out, since it requires both the capital to move prices frequently and the ability to time the sandwich in a  way that reduces the risk of arbitrage losses. It is also not clear how the attacker will weigh the cost of  the attack against the profit, as profit must be made from a stale price being recorded over a period of  time where prices will fluctuate naturally outside of the control of the attacker. This would require  constant scanning of the mempool to catch calls to  doHardWork , similar to the sandwich attack   Security Audit Report | Harvest Smart Contracts | Harvest Finance 17 February 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   12   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          discussed in  Issue B , and would require a good deal of expenditure in transaction fees to always order  before Harvest Finance transactions. Generally, there is no guarantee that an attacker will have their  transactions ordered correctly and the Harvest Finance team intends to obfuscate the time when  doHardWork  is called, making it more difficult for selfish mining to ensure proper ordering.   Technical Details   The  Vault redesign document  states:   As a consequence of the virtual price calculation, if an honest user deposits funds into a vault, they  should wait for at least one  doHardWork()  call before withdrawing, otherwise they will notice a  slight discrepancy between the deposited amount and the amount withdrawn.\"   If the share price hint is small, this attack will be easier, but it is still possible to block  doHardWork  calls if  the attacker can tolerate moving the market price with a large amount of funding. The attacker would  need to make a deposit at a normally recorded price from a previous  doHardWork  call. Assuming that  the value of the shares fluctuates, the attacker would then continuously sandwich attack the  Controller  with a price slippage that is outside of its acceptable range. This will effectively block the  call to  doHardWork  and any update to the recorded price used to prevent flash loan attacks. This  blockage will lock the price in at an outdated value and increase the discrepancy mentioned in the  Vault  redesign document . As more deposits enter the strategy, this price discrepancy could be in favor of the  early deposit from the attacker.   Mitigation   While there are currently no industry standard best practices to address sandwich attacks, in this case,  the attack can only succeed if the attacker is able to perpetually block the price update at the  Controller  level. Harvest Finance could always call  doHardWork  with a high slippage amount, but a  front-running bot could detect this and commit a normal sandwich attack with a high slippage. In addition,  any mitigations for the previous sandwich attack ( Issue B ) should help in preventing this price checkpoint  DoS attack.    Controlling or purchasing a miner that can discover blocks at a rate that  doHardWork  needs to be called  could fully remediate this issue. Clearing a full block to ensure that no sandwich attacks will throw the  expected price out of range will ensure that the Harvest Finance team can have a successful transaction  to the  Controller  contract and update the price checkpoint. However, the cost for doing so may be  prohibitive to the organization and, as a result, this approach should be only considered as a potential  mitigation.   We recommend that the Harvest Finance team further explore the potential alternative remediations  outlined in  Issue A , specifically, the  remediation  that will return the funds to the attacker without affecting  the pool if it is called before  doHardWork . This will prevent flash loan attacks and will potentially remove  further profits that could be gained by delaying the price checkpoint, as there will be no need to price  checkpoint within doHardWork, thus reducing the incentive to DoS this function.    Status   Not Applicable.

As a result of this decision, the code that is currently running in production has not been  audited by our team and we recommend it be reviewed for the presence of this or similar issues.   Additionally, we note that the  Vault.sol  still has an option  allowSharePriceDecrease  which, if set  to false, causes the doHardWork function to revert if the share price decreases.

This allows nodes to spam these messages and create unnecessary traffic in the network,  creating a DoS attack vector.    Impact   This type of attack would slow down or potentially halt network processing for the duration it was carried  out.    Preconditions   First, a node must create a valid attester or proposer slashing message by signing. Once complete,  however, they can create an unlimited amount of similar, valid-looking messages. Second, the attacker  must have access to bandwidth capable of transmitting the volume of messages necessary to create a  noticeable slow-down of the network. The node must also be able to join the network as a validator,  meaning their 32 ETH stake must be deposited and activated before they can send these types of  messages.

However, these validations currently only check that a signature is present and valid. A node  could create a number of valid looking messages and publish them. When other nodes receive these  messages, they will check the signature but nothing else, deem them valid, and forward them to the rest  of their subnet.

For a specific example, a node could create a slashable message (e.g. a double signed message) and  then propagate it. This would result in them being slashed. Once slashed, however, they can send an  unlimited amount of similar messages without punishment, since slashing is a binary state (i.e. a node is  either slashed or is not slashed).   Remediation   Since slashing is a binary state,  proposer_slashing  can be limited to one message per validator and  ignore any other duplicates that are received. Otherwise, a validator that was going to be slashed or was  already slashed could create infinite valid `proposer_slashing` messages.    voluntary_exit  messages can be treated similarly and can accept one valid  voluntary_exit  message per validator, since it is a one-time operation. If another  voluntary_exit  message is received  for a validator, it can be forwarded if it has a more recent epoch than the one that is known. Otherwise,  duplicates can be safely ignored.    The  attester_slashing  messages are a little more difficult to declare the rules for because the  slashable attestations included in the message contain many different validators. We recommend  updating the specification so that a node only forwards  attester_slashing  messages that contain  new validators not yet seen in another  attester_slashing  message.   We recommend that stronger validations be included in the specification for clients around message  forwarding for these three message types in particular.   Status   The specification was updated and applies the recommended remediation. Specifically, any  voluntary_exit  and  proposer_slashing  message is only forwarded once, ignoring duplicates.

The cost depends on the node  under attack - a home staker node with a residential internet connection is significantly less expensive to  bring down than a node in a data center with a symmetric 10GBit/s uplink.   Technical Details   Committees are computed by  RANDAO  at the beginning of each epoch and the first member (relative to  index order) of each committee is the block proposer. An attacker could then precompute IP addresses of  the validator set and keep that list updated on the fly, while that set changes over time. After the  RANDAO  is revealed, they then select all proposer addresses and DDoS them in the usual manner, when their slot is  up for execution.   Remediation   This attack can be remediated by using a proposer election system where only the elected proposer  knows that they are elected, but is able prove this to others. This way, the attacker does not know which  validator node to target before the elected validator proposes their block. Such schemes are called Single  Secret Leader Election (SSLE), as described and constructed in  [BEHG20] .    Status   The team has acknowledged the issue and is working both on implementing a short term workaround and  developing a long-term solution.    The long term solution will likely be using Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE) for electing block  proposers, based on our recommendation. Since SSLE research is still premature and implementing SSLE  is non-trivial, the Ethereum Foundation team decided to introduce this change during a later phase.   In the interim, the Ethereum Foundation team suggests that validator operators run multiple nodes, such  that one node participates in network communication on behalf of the validator, and another node is used  to propagate the blocks proposed by the validator. The decoupling of node identity and validator identity  allows for operators to switch between nodes in order to publish their blocks.   Unfortunately, operating multiple nodes comes with a financial cost that can be prohibitive for hobbyists  and home stakers. For these cases, the Ethereum Foundation team suggests introducing a  community-run semi-trusted node that accepts proposed blocks and forwards them to the network.   At present, the Ethereum Foundation team has stated that they are working on formulating processes and  recommendations that implement this pattern.   Verification   Unresolved.   ",

The large  number of connections triggers the victim node to prune, as described in gossipsub. When the node  pruning occurs, some legitimate nodes might be purged. This increases the likelihood of connections with  the attackers malicious nodes. After a number of repetitions, the target node only has connections to the  attackers node, eclipsing them from the rest of the network.    Impact   A node that has a majority of attacker nodes as peers in their topic mesh may be unable to propagate  attestations and proposed blocks to the main network. This would lead to targeted censorship of  attestations and blocks, resulting in penalties for the victim.   Furthermore, the attack is inexpensive enough to perform it over a long range of time on a series of block  proposers. This makes it possible that no new blocks are getting gossipped, which threatens the liveness  of the chain. Once a sustained attack prevents finalization for several epochs, the validators will lose  deposits due to the inactivity penalty.   Preconditions   An attacker is able to control enough identities that they have a high probability of becoming the majority  of the targets mesh peers.    Feasibility   This attack can be carried out by any actor with access to a reasonably modern computer and a decent  internet connection.    Technical Details   Given a  D_High  of 12 and a node selecting peers on the mesh to join as a target, not at random. For each  GRAFT  message let P equal the probability of adding to the target mesh while maintaining a previously  connected attack node. Assuming a target is at  D_High  with 12 connected peers, getting the first attack  node already in the list with zero previous nodes is P=1. The probability of not removing the first, or any  subsequent, attack nodes will be  P=11/12 , followed by  P=10/12,P=9/12  and so on until the final  attempt to completely fill the target mesh with attack nodes being P=1/12. Summing the expected values  of becoming an additional peer, an attacker expects to be all 12 peers in 37.2385  GRAFT  messages.  These probabilities assume that trials are independent and that the probability of success does not  change between trials (i.e. that no other peers attempt to  GRAFT  to the target while the attack is taking  place). In practice, it can be expected that more attempts to completely fill the targets mesh would be  needed.   Mitigation   An effort could be made to make a variant of gossipsub less susceptible to eclipse attacks and clients  could deviate from regular gossipsub behavior and try to detect and counteract this attack. For example,  instead of randomly pruning peers, use a conservative approach and keep old connections or connections  that provide low latency pubsub (i.e. connections that send  IHAVE  first for many messages). There are  likely other suitable metrics to heuristically determine the value of a connection.   Remediation   Instead of making the pubsub mechanism less susceptible to eclipse attacks, we recommend making the  beacon chain rely on a protocol that is eclipse-resistant. See  Issue C .

        "title": "Issue E: Misaligned Gossip Incentives",
        "body": "    Synopsis   Rational, or non-altruistic Beacon Nodes (BN) in the gossip network are only incentivised to relay  information to other BNs if it provides their messages with a higher probability of being seen by the  network. Where it is expected that relaying this information increases their profitability (i.e. increase the  likelihood that their block proposal and attestation messages are propagated). If another BN requests  blocks, or asks to relay a message, then it would be a cost burden of some degree on the bandwidth of  the rational BN.    Impact   This could lead to a tragedy of the commons where BNs are incentivized into using the gossip network  only in their favor. This would require altruistic nodes to take on more network traffic and increase gossip  latency. However, this may not be of any immediate concern and more research is needed to fully  understand this concern.    Preconditions   This is only likely if the network is providing a stressful load to a rational BN and there is a clear price to  behaving altruistically that many will not take on.   Feasibility   There are many examples of altruistic actions and we are unsure of the cost that will be placed on these  nodes at this time. It is likely that altruistic nodes will take on rational node costs.    Technical Details   We define altruistism as a BN performing an action initiated by another BN on the network without  compensation (i.e if BN A forwards attestations from BN B, then A expects that B will forward their  attestations messages). Another example is provided in  Issue G  where control messages meant to keep  nodes in sync are abused to always request more information than is produced. The common resource is  a healthy network that can deliver messages that all nodes require as a whole, and a tragedy being a  situation where nodes behave in a self interested way that damages the network.    A rational node we define as one that would attempt to minimize short term costs or maximize profit (i.e.  saving bandwidth costs by not gossiping messages that a node has no interest in, or selectively reducing  the chance of others to maintain validator good standing such that the attackers profits are increased).    Remediation   Methods to deal with rational actors in gossip networks are known, for example under models like  Byzantine, Altruistic, Rational (BAR) tolerant  Gossip described in  [LCWNRAD06]  and first introduced in  [AACDMP05] . Similar strategies might succeed here, too. These strategies come with tradeoffs and it is  not clear what the best approach for Eth2.0 traffic will be at this time.    Security Audit Report | Ethereum 2.0 Specifications | Ethereum Foundation 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   10   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Status   This is an area of ongoing research as the network unfolds and activity is monitored and analyzed.   Proof of Work (PoW) networks have a limited amount of gossip communication, primarily due to block  and transaction propagation. Traditionally in PoW systems, there are tendencies towards more  centralized solutions that are deployed to ensure timely block delivery and healthy propagation in general.  Ethereum is working hard to avoid these strategies if possible by taking into consideration distributed  reputation and scoring systems. PoS networks will require slightly more complicated messaging which  could make this challenging.     Verification   Unresolved.   (Invalid)  Issue F: Bias in Weighted Random Sampling in Election of Block  Proposers   Location   compute_proposer_index    Synopsis   The probability for an active validator to be elected block proposer should be their deposit, divided by the  deposit of all active validators. Measurements have shown that this is not the case.   Impact   Based on an initial review, it seems like the measured bias in favour of validators with a higher effective  balance further incentivizes not provoking to get slashed. However, it is possible that there are edge  cases where this unexpected behavior produces results that are not in the interest of the network.   Technical Details   The following test setup describes an extreme, but possible case in which the proposer selection function  should behave as expected. Sets of validators of different sizes are prepared. In each of these sets, all  validators have an effective balance of 16 ETH, except one, that has an expected balance of 32 ETH. Then  run the  compute_proposer_index  function over these validators. Each test is performed 32 times and  the average each of the resulting values approximates typical behaviour. The expected outcome is that in  all cases, all 16 ETH validators get elected roughly the same amount of time, and the 32 ETH validator  gets elected roughly twice as often.   However, test results show that this is not the behavior of the function. In order to learn about the  statistical properties of the function, a large number of samples is required. Since the python executable  specification is not very fast, the tests were performed using zrnt.   Two irregularities are identified with this test. The first validator in the set consistently gets elected more  often than the rest. The extent of this advantage varies, depending on the number of validators and the  ratio of the own stake and that of the rest of the network. Second, as the validator set grows larger, the  validator with more stake is elected disproportionately more often than the others.   A possible cause of these issues is the  compute_proposer_index  function, which performs a variant  of the rejection sampling method. Instead of sampling a new validator that is tested in every round, it  performs a random permutation once and then iterates over that.   Security Audit Report | Ethereum 2.0 Specifications | Ethereum Foundation 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   11   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        The fact that the first validator gets elected more than the others suggests that there is an issue in the  permutation function, as the first validator in the shuffled list will have a much higher chance of getting  elected. The shuffle function described in the specification appears to match the description in  [HMR12] .    Remediation   We advise performing tests to verify whether the shuffle really behaves randomly.   We do not have a concrete explanation for why validators with large deposits get elected more often as  the validator set grows. We did identify two possible sources of error, though.   First, the rejection sampling variant used in the specification iterates over a random permutation instead  of sampling fresh on every iteration. This discrepancy is measurable with very small sets of validators, but  unlikely to have an impact with many validators. The probability for a validator to get tested for rejection  twice within one function invocation is 0 for the permutation (ignoring the case where all validators have  been rejected), but 1/n^2 for re-sampling with n validators. While we did measure small irregularities for  very small validator sets (up to 16 validators), the data we measured especially shows deviations from the  expected result for large validator sets. This suggests that there is another issue.   The other possible source of error we identified is that the resolution of the rejection test is not high  enough. In each rejection test round, only a single byte is used to sample. The probability of the validator  to be sampled has over 32 bits of resolution. Reading four bytes from the result of the hash function  instead of one should reduce sampling error.   The tests we performed are in the  dist_test  branch of our fork of the  zrnt  repository, as well as PR #9  in our fork of the  eth2.0-specs  repository.   We consider the issue resolved when the provided tests indicate that proposer election rates are in fact  proportional to the effective balance of the validators.   Status   Invalid Issue. We initially ran the tests with the  zrnt  testnet presets. These configured the shuffle  algorithm to only perform 10 instead of 90 rounds, which resulted in statistically significant biases in the  election of block proposers.   Rerunning the test with the mainnet presets did not show these biases. Therefore, the issue does not  apply with the mainnet parameter selection of Ethereum 2.0.   Verification   Not Applicable.    Issue G: Gossipsub Control Message DoS   Location   Libp2p spec control messages    Libp2p gossipsub implementation   Synopsis   The Ethereum 2.0 P2P networking specification relies on libp2p gossipsub. Gossipsub uses an optimistic  push to handle gossiping messages with what are called Control Messages. The control messages in  questions are  IHAVE ,  IWANT , and  GRAFT  that could cause network traffic overhead on a target node.    Security Audit Report | Ethereum 2.0 Specifications | Ethereum Foundation 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   12   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Impact   This overhead could come at sensitive times when the node needs bandwidth to communicate and sync  with other nodes., which may result in reduced rewards (because their attestation is only added to later  blocks) or penalties (if the attack is strong enough to interrupt the service of the validator).   Preconditions   There must be no limits placed on the optimistic pushing of messages, and the message cache of the  target needs to be large enough to be required to send enough data that it hinders the targets connection.   Feasibility   This would only require a single peer and internet connection to cause traffic overhead in the target,  therefore the costs are inexpensive on the attacker side. However, we havent fully investigated the  disparity in relative resource consumption. There is also a tight bound in libp2p on the window of the  cache. A node will request messages that are not in the seen cache, meaning the attacker needs to  generate valid messages not in this cache. The cache is said to hold two minutes of message ID data. A  node will also only respond with data held within the  GossipHistoryGossip  slot length, which is  defaulted to three slots and assumed to be a minimal amount of message history stored, making this a  moderate to low feasibility attack at current understanding.   Technical Details   An example of optimistic pushing that forces network traffic overhead on a target is a sender  S  initiates a  message to a receiver  R  with the control message  IHAVE .  R  then ignores if they have already seen those  ID s and responds to  S  with  IWANT(IHAVE.ids.length()) . The  S  client will then process every  IWANT  ID  in the control message and begin sending all messages in their cache that match the provided IDs.    IHAVE  control messages will trigger a peer to search to see if they have seen this list of message  ID s,  within a default value of two minutes, from the sender of the  IHAVE  message. The attacking client could  be modified here to ignore if the messages have been seen and load an  IWANT  control message with all  of the  IHAVE   ID s where  ID s are in the targets range of [0.. CacheWindow.length ]. The attacker only  needs to send a list of message IDs and the target will reply with up to 1MB message bodies depending  on the message for each ID, potentially inundating the target machine. Alternatively it may be possible to  originate an  IWANT(suspected_ids_target_has)  control message without seeing what the peer  already has and target a peer that isnt actively gossiping with the attacker. If the target node has been  filled with a large cache of messages from the following attack, this may cause a large amount of  messages to be sent.   IWANT  control messages could be forged by an attacker to contain messages  ID s for invalid messages  by first sending to the target an  IHAVE  message for a topic the target is listening to with many invalid  message  ID s. This would cause the target to download and verify the invalid messages sent by the  attacker. If message validation is a slow process, this could consume resources on the targets node. Also  a node may attempt to store old valid messages and wait for the  SEEN cache  timed message cache to  lapse after two minutes and attempt to retransmit old messages that are no longer in the  SEEN cache ,  causing the target to load their  mcache  with a large amount of old messages. If there is no bound  checking on future valid messages, these may also get stored in the  mcache .   Repeated  GRAFT  messages from an attacker to a target may also cause some unwanted network activity  on the target by forcing a  PRUNE  message response. This should cost the attacker as much as the target.   Mitigation   Regulate the amount of messages a peer is willing to store in the  mcache  and respond with in  IWANT  control messages.   Security Audit Report | Ethereum 2.0 Specifications | Ethereum Foundation 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   13   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.      Remediation   Implementing something more sophisticated than simple regulation like tit-for-tat may be possible. Using  the same or similar research linked to in the Remediation section of  Issue D  could help alleviate this  traffic overhead in an even more sophisticated way. If  S  only responds to  R  with an equivalent amount of  messages that  S  has not already seen from  R , then it makes it harder for  R  to endlessly request data. The  tradeoff for implementing such a strategy is that lagging nodes or new nodes will have a harder time  syncing with the network.   Verification could require simulating game theory strategies for how nodes serve each other data. When it  is not possible or in the best interest of an attacker to perform this attack, it is considered resolved.    Status   According to the Ethereum Foundation team, the following mitigation strategies are in progress:    Protocol Labs libp2p team is working on hardening gossipsub; and   The Ethereum Foundation is working on publishing the details on the protections that will be put   in place, such as peer scoring and blacklisting.   Verification   Unresolved.   Suggestions   Suggestion 1: Improve Specification for ENR and P2P Systems   Synopsis   We found the documentation around the P2P and ENR systems of Ethereum 2.0 to be insufficient.  Specifically, we were unable to conclude how the P2P system incorporates the ENR system. We  recommend a more thorough and detailed document around how the ENR system should work with the  P2P interface and the gossipsub system.   Status   The Ethereum Foundation team states that they are currently working on a bidirectional conversion  function between multiaddr and ENR fields to allow for a canonical construction of a multiaddr from a  discovered ENR, which they intend to submit to the Ethereum 2.0 specifications repository as a PR for  review and integration into the specification.   Verification   Unresolved.   Suggestion 2: Consider Implementing a BAR-Resilient Gossip Protocol   Location   The  specification states  that  gossipsub  will be the protocol used for communication between nodes.   Synopsis   We recommend implementing a BAR-resilient gossip protocol as a way to provide additional guarantees  around node failure and throughput for the network given different conditions of partitions and possible  bad actors.    Security Audit Report | Ethereum 2.0 Specifications | Ethereum Foundation 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   14   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Status   The Ethereum Foundation team has made note of the ongoing efforts with Protocol Labs, the maintainers  of libp2p / gossipsub, to investigate BAR-resilient peer-sampling techniques to harden the protocol. They  also raised questions on how to best achieve Sybil attack resistance in the context of blockchain  networks, as it is suggested in the paper on BAR Gossip,  [LCWNRAD06] , that each participant is limited to  a single identity. In addition, the Ethereum Foundation also made known that a design goal of theirs has  been to avoid the use of validator pubkeys to enhance the P2P layer, in order to avoid coupling validator  identity with node identity and therefore allowing for flexibility for additional potential and sophisticated  validation/network setup designs ( Issue C ).   To note, the abstract principle of BAR-resilient gossip often goes beyond peer-sampling techniques and  also ensures that freeriding off the gossip platform is not possible. At present and to the best of our  knowledge, there is no proof of whether or not such BAR-resilience is possible in an entirely  permissionless system.   Our team proposed looking into BAR-resilient gossiping in order to help prevent greedy participants  freeriding on the gossip system. However, we do not consider Byzantine participants a significant issue,  given that they can only send too few or too many messages. In general, gossip networks do well with  handling participants that forward too few messages, for example when a few nodes completely fail. As a  result, we believe that this does not require further action. Sending too many messages is equivalent to  attempting to overwhelm the recipient with network traffic. While this problem may be resolved on the  gossip layer, it is not on the network layer. Thus, a publicly dialable participant can always be subject to a  DDoS attack.     Since the Ethereum P2P layer only forwards valuable messages, this type of attack does not pose an  application-layer threat. The attacks a Sybil node could launch on the gossip layer are not significantly  more powerful than network layer DDoS attacks (e.g. simple UDP floods). As a result, we consider Sybil  attacks tolerable and mitigating against them to be a lower-priority target.   Verification   Unresolved.   Suggestion 3: Peer Review of Consensus Papers and Proofs    Synopsis   Consensus systems are notoriously difficult to audit. Peer review processes are the de facto standard to  ensure quality research. Since consensus is at the heart of Ethereum 2.0, we recommend a peer review of  the theorems and proofs in the ongoing research on the consensus protocol, described in  [BHKPQRSWZ19] , once finalized.   Status   The Ethereum Foundations team notes that the ongoing research paper combining Casper FFG and  LMD-GHOST,  [BHKPQRSWZ19] , is under final review and near completion. They have stated their intent to  publish the first draft on  arXiv , with the intention of soliciting a community review, before seeking to  publish and submit the paper for peer review in a journal and conference.    Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation team has stated that they are working with Runtime Verification to  formally model the  Beacon Chain Phase 0 Specification in K  and are currently working on formally proving  that the Phase 0 specification correctly implements the theorems and proofs outlined in  [BHKPQRSWZ19] . They have stated their intent to also publish and submit this work to a conference and  journal for peer review.

This causes a class of errors that aren't handled in the Lisk-codec module itself and would  therefore have to be handled by the caller.

This opens an attack vector for searching a low-entropy password  space efficiently.   Impact   A successful attack would allow the attacker to sign arbitrary transactions on behalf of the target. In the  Lisk-core network, actions like token transfers and participation in distributed proof-of-stake could be  taken without the targets prior knowledge and without any recourse. In derivative networks, additional  actions which utilize account key signatures would also be impacted.   Preconditions   An attacker would need access to the encrypted mnemonic as persisted (cipher-text, salt, iv, etc.), as well  as to significant, yet realistic, computational resources.     Feasibility   The preconditions imply some prior successful attack, which makes this issue less likely to be exploited,  although still possible. To increase the speed and chance of success, an attacker would likely require  substantial hardware acceleration and/or compute resources (e.g. GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs).   Technical Details   PBKDF2  is being used to derive an AES-256-GCM encryption key from a potentially low-entropy password.  That key is then used to encrypt a BIP39 mnemonic. This facilitates file-system persistence of the  mnemonic without the need to persist (and secure) an additional key.   The use of password-based key derivation here is a reasonable solution for this case. AES-256-GCM for  encryption is a reasonable choice for this use case as well. PBKDF2 however, is purely CPU-bound. This  makes it vulnerable to hardware-acceleration-based attacks, especially in the face of a well incentivized  and resourceful attacker. Using a memory-hard function prevents this.   Security Audit Report | Lisk Project: Protocol Design + Implementation | Lisk Foundation 18 December 2020  by Least Authority TFA GmbH   7   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          Mitigation   We suggest the following mitigation approaches:    End users could manually secure their encrypted mnemonic with an additional layer of encryption   when not in use; or    The application could estimate the strength of the password and reject ones that are obviously   weak; or    End users could store their encrypted mnemonic on an external device and/or cold storage when   not in use.   Remediation   Use the more modern password-based key derivation algorithm  argon2 .  Node bindings to the argon2  reference implementation are available under very permissive licenses (MIT, Apache2/CC0).   Argon2  comes in multiple flavours. Since in this use-case GPU-accelerated attacks are more of a  concern than side-channel attacks, the variant  Argon2d  should be used. Section 4 of the  Argon2 draft  RFC  discusses parameter choice and describes a procedure for choosing them optimally.   Status   The Lisk team has responded that they acknowledge that there are better options for the encryption of the  mnemonic passphrase, however, they intend to continue using the PBKDF2 algorithm. They note that it is  currently used extensively in well-established projects and the risk of the attack is low. As a result, they do  not consider the benefit of implementing a new algorithm to outweigh the cost at the present time.  Nonetheless, they have indicated that implementing  argon2  has been added to their backlog.   However, they have included in their documentation a reminder to  users to always secure their  passphrase with a strong password.  Although this helps to mitigate the issue, we suggest further action  be taken to mitigate the issue in the interim.   Verification   Unresolved.   ",

Instead, an extractor such as HKDF-Extract should be used to avoid the  unnecessary risk for such an attack.    Impact   The derived keys are used to sign network transactions. If compromised, an attacker could sign arbitrary  transactions on behalf of the target. In the Lisk-core network, actions like token transfers and  participation in delegated-proof-of-stake could be taken without the targets prior knowledge and without  any recourse. In derivative networks, additional actions which utilize account key signatures would also  be impacted.   Feasibility   No efficient attacks are publicly known.   Technical Details   SHA-256 is a hash function, not an extractor. If youre extracting keys, the best practice is to use an  extractor. HKDF is a simple, efficient and provably secure extract-then-expand key derivation function.  Many libraries allow running only the extract phase of the KDF, which suffices in this case. The HKDF  extract phase takes two inputs: the input keying material IKM and a salt. The purpose of the salt is not to  grow the search space, but to randomize the extraction procedure. Therefore, a single 256 bit salt should  be chosen at random by the developers and hard-coded in the application.   Remediation   Use HKDF to derive the account key from the mnemonic. Use the mnemonic as input keying material and  a random salt that was generated by the developers and hard-coded into the application.   We understand that this is a breaking change for account keys. One migration path could be to operate  two accounts in parallel, one of them SHA-based and one HKDF-based, and transfer all assets from the  SHA-based account to the HKDF-based account. Then, the SHA-based account would need to be  monitored for new incoming transactions, and received assets would need to be forwarded to the  HKDF-based account. We recommend generating a new mnemonic for the HKDF-based account, because  doing otherwise would constitute a form of key reuse.   Status   The Lisk team responded that they do not intend to implement a remediation for this issue, as they  consider the required account migration and added account management effort to be unacceptable at  this time. We recommend that the Lisk team reconsider resolving this issue in the future, especially if  there is a more convenient opportunity when making other updates to the project.

The  transferOwnership()  function checks that the address provided as the new owner is not zero.  However, if an incorrect address is provided to this function, then control of the token will be lost.    Impact   High. The impact of this mistake is significant as control of the token will be lost if an address is provided  for which the organization does not have a corresponding private key.   Preconditions   An accidental address must be authorized by an Ethereum transaction from the current valid owner of the  fiat token.   Feasibility   The likelihood of providing an account that is incorrect during the transfer of ownership is low. Transfer of  ownership of a fiat token may not happen frequently or may be controlled by a multisig account where  many individuals must agree that the new account is accurate.   Mitigation   A two step method to transfer ownership, while costing a bit of extra gas, could prevent a rare case where  ownership is transferred to an account that is not controlled by the intended organization. This process  would have two functions that would be called to transfer ownership. The first step is to propose a new  owner, modified to have access only by the current owner. This will store the potential new owner in the  token contracts state. The second step is to call a function that accepts the new owner that is modified to  only have access to the new owners account. As a result, if the account being updated to is not  controlled, the current owner may still reverse the mistake and try again.

For example, if the source of the transaction fails, the check on atomex.tz line  79 results in a message stating wrong sender address\" without further explanation on the issue.   Impact   When a transaction executes in a way that will fail, the client software or initiator of the transaction may  have a difficult time identifying the failure case.

Synopsis   The modifiers for how a function should restrict the access to the function body are not consistent  among the different contract implementations. For example:    The Atomic Swap (Ethereum) contract does not check that the provided  participant  is   non-zero;    The Atomic ERC-20 contract checks that the  participant  is non-zero;    The FA1.2 contract checks that only the  participant  is not the source of the transaction; and   The Atomic Swap (Tezos) contract only checks that the  participant  exists and has proper   typing.    Impact   The intended requirements for the participants of a swaps address are not clear. Some contracts have  strict requirements for address validation while others do not, which implies that some contracts lack  guarantees that a participant address is the intended address. Without stricter requirements, an  accidental address could be provided and go unnoticed. This could lead to a case where a redemption is  not possible on one end of the swap, while it is possible on the other.   Preconditions   A mistaken participant address must be supplied.   Feasibility   This is only moderately feasible as any given party may witness the mistake and not complete a swap and  await a refund.   Remediation   Ensure that all participant address requirements are satisfied in each implementation of the swaps  contracts.    For the Atomic Swap (Ethereum) and ERC-20 contracts, ensure that there is a check for a non-zero  address provided.    Status   Following a refactor by the Atomex team, the  Atomic Swap (Ethereum)  contract has been updated to  include a check to ensure that non-zero addresses are present in the participant parameter, making this  consistent with the edge case checking done in the  ERC-20 contracts .    After further discussion with the Atomex team in which they state that the only undesirable address in the  parameter is the sender, we agree the  Atomic Swap (Tezos)  and  FA1.2  contract checks are adequate and  do not need to be consistent or present in the initialization functions of the Atomic Swap (Tezos)  contract.

Impact   Deprecated and undocumented functions, especially when used to avoid error handling, can behave in  ways that are hard to predict or may change over time. In cases of failure, the above functions will often  generate cryptic and unhelpful error messages. For the functions with no documentation, it is impossible  to have confidence in the behavior of the function, especially for edge cases or in future updates of the  PascaLIGO compiler.   Technical Details   In many cases, these are functions that have the potential to fail, but avoid handling the failure. For  example,  get_entrypoint  will fail if pointed to a contract without the specified entrypoint with a  confusing error message such as bad address for get_entrypoint (%transfer). The PascaLIGO reference  suggests  Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt , which requires explicit handling of the failure case.

Preconditions   The attacker needs to convince a peer to connect to its IP address, expecting the peer ID of a target peer.   Feasibility   The attack is straightforward with unsigned peer records.   Technical Details   First, the attacker broadcasts a fake peer record with the target's ID and the attacker's IP. When a victim  connects to the attacker, the attacker proxies them to the target. The target and the victim will both  believe the other has the attacker's IP address. If more than one victim is proxied to the same target, the  target will start to negatively score the victims. This may cause their score to fall low enough that the  target refuses to mesh with them or to ignore their gossip. The target will penalize all victims that connect  through the attacker, considering them sybils. If a victim falls for the same trick twice by the same  attacker, the same penalty is applied to both targets.   Remediation   A more reliable way of associating IDs with IP addresses is required. Since libp2p is already in the  process of switching to signed peer records, an attacker will be unable to create a signed peer record that  claims an ID they do not control.

Sybil attackers influence a victim to mesh with the sybils by behaving in a calculated way to make their  score increase. This may cause the peer to unmesh from honest peers and produce a higher proportion of  sybils in the network. As a result,   the mesh gets an overall higher percentage of sybil members, which,  for example,  could result in delaying the network.   Impact   A single peer could be influenced to unmesh from honest peers. If a peer that is delivering many  messages leaves the honest mesh, one possible impact is that it could cause the network to be delayed.  If that delay hits critical thresholds such as block time, that delay is equally harmful as dropping  messages.   Security Audit Report | Gossipsub v1.1 | Protocol Labs 3 June 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   8   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Preconditions   The attacker needs a faster route from the publishers to the victim in addition to enough unique IP  addresses such that the sybils can replace the mesh of the victim, without hitting the colocation penalty.   Feasibility   It would be straightforward to apply to a single peer, however, it would be more challenging but likely  possible to pull off at a larger scale.   Technical Details   Due to the random structure of a gossip network, most peers are not connected directly to the publishers.  Although peers may possibly be connected to some publishers, they are not connected to all of them.  This lack of direct connection is essential to the scalability of the network since the publisher would  otherwise require a significant amount of resources. However, an attacker could connect directly to  publishers and then to a victim, likely having a shorter path and therefore getting the messages before the  victim. By delivering the messages to the victim before the honest peers do, the victim will give them a  higher score than the other peers and eventually unmesh the honest peers and only mesh with the sybils.    Remediation   This attack is possible because the attackers are able to create incoming connections at will and a  Gossipsub peer treats these connections as equivalent to the outgoing connections that they control. If  peers had a quota to always maintain  some  outgoing mesh connections, then the attackers would not be  able to fully take over the peer's mesh, unless the peer willingly connects to them (which is somewhat  more difficult for the attackers to ensure).   Status   Minimum quotas for outgoing connections chosen by the node have been established, and when pruning  peers due to oversubscription, they remain connected to at least that quota of outgoing peers. As a result,  it is now no longer possible for attackers to influence all a peer's connections, since that peer will always  maintain at least some connections which are not controlled by the attacker.

As a result, an attacker can request a graft and immediately send  fresh messages which increases their score. If they increase their score enough, it is possible that honest  peers will be unmeshed in a subsequent heartbeat.   Security Audit Report | Gossipsub v1.1 | Protocol Labs 3 June 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   9   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Impact   This would allow for a more efficient way to carry out the love bombing attack (see  Issue B ).   Preconditions   The same preconditions apply as  Issue B , which are further aided if the attacker knows when the victim's  heartbeat takes place.   Feasibility   This attack can be performed from a cheap Virtual Private Server (VPS). To increase the chances, the VPS  should be deployed in a datacenter as close to the victim as possible, which does not increase the cost or  difficulty of the attack.   Technical Details   Similar to  Issue B , sybils prearrange many connections to publishers. Connecting to a Gossipsub peer  takes some time given that there are several layers of protocol handshakes to get through, at least one  roundtrip each for multistream, secure channel, and transport upgrader. As a result, attackers would also  need to prearrange a connection to each victim. Once they are ready and think they can rapidly deliver  messages (faster than the peer is getting them otherwise), they send a graft request, rapidly followed by  as many messages as possible. If they manage to deliver the first message, it is possible that their score  becomes more than that of honest peers. If the peer is now over the mesh limits ( D_high ), then the peer  should prune the lower scoring peers.   Remediation   This attack depends on the ability of a peer to request a graft and immediately be grafted. The  remediation is simple and requires rejecting new grafts immediately if the peer is already at the high  threshold.   Status   If a node already has  D_high  active mesh connections, incoming grafts are rejected, and a prune  response is sent without delay. Outgoing grafts are still permitted, which allows recovery from eclipse  events even when connected to many peers.   Verification   Resolved.   ",

If that discovery service is attacked, the defense could potentially fail.  The broader  libp2p/IPFS ecosystem is highly modular, but some available peer discovery methods are too insecure to  provide the assurances required by Gossipsub.    Security Audit Report | Gossipsub v1.1 | Protocol Labs 3 June 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   10   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Impact   Depending on how severely the discovery service is attacked and how much the Gossipsub instance relies  on it, it could severely impact the Gossipsub mesh's ability to recover from an attack.   Preconditions   A Gossipsub instance must depend on a vulnerable peer discovery service, such as DHT.   Feasibility   It would be easier to perform an attack on the peer discovery service than on Gossipsub directly. For the  DHT discovery service, it would be fairly easy.   Technical Details   It is somewhat difficult to secure a DHT since they are open by design and assume that peers will interact  helpfully with random strangers. The existing literature contains a number of attacks on them, such as the  Eclipse attack [ SNDW06 ].   In the Eclipse attack, attackers create fake nodes with keys nearby the target. When honest peers request  that target, they are likely to get a response from an attacker. Thus, the attackers can censor a node or  provide false information.   The libp2p Kademlia (DHT) implementation could be potentially be vulnerable to Eclipse attacks. Bucket  assignment is based simply on peer ID, a value the attacker controls, so it is easy and feasible to generate  new peers to Eclipse a given topic. In addition, DHT peers will recommend other peers that have  responded to a RPC request, which is a somewhat lower bar than Gossipsub (since there is no peer score  function). Therefore, it is probably easier to attack the DHT than to attack Gossipsub. However, under the  assumption that a DHT is used for peer discovery, an attack on Gossipsub could begin with attacking the  DHT.   Mitigation   Node operators can configure explicit peering arrangements instead of using the DHT.   Remediation   It would be very difficult to prevent this entirely. The libp2p DHT could be hardened by any of the  following:    The discovery service could use other less vulnerable services;    Peers could detect if a given discovery service becomes unreliable (low rate of successful   connections or a high rate of connecting to bad peers); and     Rebalance to other services or alert the operator.    Our team recommends additional research into hardening the DHT and other discovery services.   It has also been suggested to use bootstrappers and peer exchange. New peers would connect to a  bootstrapper and, when they are unmeshed, they become recommended peers to mesh with. It seems  possible that this could be vulnerable to attacks (such as love bombing the bootstrappers), but it has not  yet been as well studied or researched as the attacks on DHTs.   Status   The  Gossipsub v1.1 specification  now includes a recommendation that network operators may use peer  exchange via bootstrapping instead of a peer discovery service.

Synopsis   Change_keys  allows for changing control of the multisig contract by changing the owner keys. The  /tzbtc/README.md points to a multisig contract with functionality to update the signing accounts  existing on the multisig where there could be issues with locking the contracts ownership out at the  multisig level.

Synopsis   Random classes are not cryptographically strong and the numbers chosen are not completely random  because a definite mathematical algorithm is used to select them.    Impact     Compromise of the secure generation of  SpendingKey .   Feasibility   Moderate. An attacker would have to control the system elements (system time) used to seed the  Random number generator. This would require a side channel where the attacker has installed malware  on the target.   Technical Details   It is not safe to use Random class for tasks that require a high level of security. Furthermore, this code  creates a Random object and uses it to generate but one random number at a time. Random numbers are  guessable, especially since the only usage spotted of this method is using a magic number of (0) as a  seed value.   Mitigation   Replace the Random class usage with a  java.security.SecureRandom  instead and avoid allocating  a new  SecureRandom  for each random number needed.   Remediation   Use  SecureRandom  for all tasks that require a high level of security.

Impact   The value of  maxActiveNodes  can be filled up with adversarial nodes that can censor incoming and  outgoing traffic, leading to a DOS on the node and Super Representative. In particular, this vulnerability  can be chained or used as a preparation for other types of attacks for Super Representative or exchanges.   Security Audit Report | TRON Protocol | TRON 6 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.            Preconditions   Due to the implementation of the  maxActiveNodesWithSameIp = 2  cap, an attacker needs 15  different IP addresses to control a node's view of the TRON VM. After a node is restarted, the attacker  must fill up the node's connection pool before any non-malicious connections are established. If a node is  running, an attacker can use the reputation metrics in  getScore()  to establish connections to a node  with a high score (e.g. high  p2pHandShake.count, low discoverMessageLatency ). As a result,  CheckConnectNumberTask  would remove non-adversarial peers with lower reputation over time.   Feasibility   Low to moderate probability that enough of the peer nodes can be controlled by the attacker to  manipulate the blockchain state of the target VM. In terms of cost, this attack could be conducted for very  little using cloud-based VPS services like AWS, where an attacker can easily spin up many hosts for this  purpose.   Mitigation   Implement whitelisting for node connections and establish and drop connections randomly to make it  harder for an attacker to consistently control a victim nodes view.   Remediation   A regression test could consist of a node initialized with a full connection pool, where all connections do  not forward any outgoing traffic. Mitigation strategies can be measured by the time the node requires to  establish and hold a connection to a non-malicious fraction of the network (e.g. containing a validator  majority).    Status   java-tron implemented the following three strategies to mitigate the aforementioned issue:   1. Provide a whitelisted list of trusted nodes;  2. Randomly drop and establish connections to inactive nodes with exclusion to trusted nodes; and  3. Restricting the number of incoming connections from the same IP address to one.

This class of algorithms has been considered insuciently secure for several years because it is embarrassingly parallelizable.  Impact  The limitations of PBKDF2 may result in leakage of vault contents (i.e. mnemonics and secret keys) which can then be compromised by an attacker and result in loss of user funds.  Preconditions  The attack requires access to the encrypted vaults and this could happen through multiple vectors. A malicious website extension would need to circumvent browser security measures. A regular program running with user permissions usually can access the browser prole and, thus, all extension data.  Feasibility  The feasibility of the attack depends on the strength of the password. Argon2 provides security benets particularly for weak passwords, which could realistically be guessed by brute force.  Technical Details  PBKDF2 is a function that derives keys from passwords and the function iteratively calls a normal hash function (in this case SHA256). This means it has a tight loop and only requires a small amount of memory. This can be eciently parallelized and even implemented on an FPGA or an ASIC with relatively minimal effort.  The newer class of memory-hard hash functions avoids this problem by accessing a large amount of memory, which is always cost prohibitive to implement in hardware.  Remediation  We recommend using the memory-hard Argon2id function, instead of the currently implemented PBKDF2. In Section 4 of the Argon2 RFC, guidance is provided for the choice of parameters. We suggest selecting t=3 iterations, p=4 lanes and m=2^(16) (64 MiB of RAM), 128-bit salt, and 256-bit tag size (i.e. the second recommended option).  In addition, we suggest performing the computation in WebAssembly (e.g. using the argon2-browser package).  Status  The Tally team has chosen not to resolve this issue at this time, as they are unsure of the maturity of Argon2. However, we maintain our recommendation of using Argon2id instead of PBKDF2. Agron2 has been declared winner of the Password Hashing Competition in 2015, and the argon2-browser package is compiled from the reference c implementation. It has undergone scientic research since publication. This leads us to believe that it is suciently tested for production, while also addressing the mentioned problems of PBKDF2.

The old versions are kept in order to provide a recovery path in the event that an unexpected issue or error occurs. However, there are cases when deleting old vaults is desirable (e.g. when changing the password or deleting an account).  Impact  This may result in the leakage of private key material or proof of control over an account that has been deleted. This could lead to loss of funds or impact plausible deniability of deleted account data.  Preconditions  The attack requires access to the encrypted vaults (i.e. UI access to the browser or access to the lesystem with user privileges). In addition, one of two things must hold, depending on the scenario. If the user changes their password after noticing it is compromised, the attacker must also know the compromised password. They can then access the private keys as they were before the password was changed.  If the user deleted an account and claims they have never been the owner of that account, the attacker could compel the user to provide the password and decrypt previous vaults, which would prove their control over the account.  Feasibility  If the preconditions hold, the attack is trivial.  Technical Details  In the key handling code, vaults are encrypted containers that store the secret wallet information, such as keys and mnemonics. When the secret wallet information is changed, a new vault is created and added to the data store, instead of overwriting the existing contents. This means that all previous vaults remain in the database. A user who deliberately makes destructive changes to their vault, such as changing the password or deleting an account, would expect that the old data does not remain on the device.  Remediation  We recommend implementing one of the two following remediations:   Provide a function that clears all encrypted vaults, or a ag to overwrite all existing vaults in the  next update; or   Provide a function that updates previous vaults, either for re-encrypting with a new key, or to  sanitize vaults from data that is being deleted.  Status  The Tally team has responded that they will not be addressing this issue at this time because they are concerned about accidental loss of key material. The missing of intended key disposal is a signicant security risk, and we consider accidental disposal of keys to be a manageable risks.

User notication and key replacement becomes more complex as the system scales. The key revocation and replacement process must include a security assessment of data encrypted by the compromised key.  Impact  In the case that an unexpected key replacement is required, and is not executed in a timely and well coordinated manner, nodes using revoked keys could be severed from the MTG network, and the MTG could potentially be destabilized, putting users at risk.

The Compound and Pando protocols have the potential to accumulate and control signicant amounts of funds. Thus, there are many security risks to different aspects of these systems. We identify three different categories of risks that surround such systems:   Technical risks: Faulty implementation of the system, usage of dependencies, inter-node communication, attacks targeting the Compound or Pando infrastructure causing service interruption, hijacking of trusted MTG nodes, and tampering with oracles servers.   Economic risks: Exploits of the economic model of Compound and Pando and how the protocols  react to blackswan events.   Third-party security failure risks: Failures of third-party services utilized by Compound and Pando,  such as the Mixin Network or the oracles used to fetch market information.  Systems like Compound and Pando would benet from having a publicly accessible and comprehensive security roadmap that can increase trust by the community and broaden user adoption.  Impact  The impact of the risks can include, but is not limited to, users loss of funds, system interruption, and the protocol losing adoption.  Mitigation  Systems similar to Compound and Pando, such as MakerDao, have publicly accessible security roadmaps that demonstrate what has been done and what is planned for improving the securing of these critical systems. Compound and Pando can benet from adopting a similar approach to the security of their protocol.  To increase the overall security of the protocols, we recommend creating a publicly accessible security roadmap and including the following components:   Develop and document a security roadmap for Compound and Pando;  Publish Compound and Pando code bases as open source;  Include multiple audits by different security teams in the security roadmap;  \u25cb Mixin Network and MTG \u25cb mixin-sdk  Security Audit Report | Compound + Pando | Fox One 10 September 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   \u25cb Oracle Component \u25cb Pando Rings Web \u25cb Pando Leaf Web   Plan audits at appropriate milestones in the development roadmap of both protocols; and  Participate in bug bounty programs.

The Compound Protocol is a smart contract for Ethereum for borrowing and supplying assets. Since the underlying machinery of Mixin Network differs strongly from the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Ecosystem, our team recommends thorough documentation and analysis of the Compound Protocol in the setting of Mixin Network.  Pando  Pandos design is inspired by MakerDao and Synthetix, very complex systems with carefully balanced incentives and governance mechanisms to ensure that the systems remain stable and free from exploitation. To inspire user trust and provide assurance in the system, it is critical to provide a clear protocol specication of how the system is intended to behave, and to verify through 3rd party security teams that the code is working in accordance with the specication. For comparison, see MakerDAO's protocol specication.  Impact  Compound & Pando  Our team found that the Compound and Pando design document provided for this security review to be insucient. A usable protocol specication must specify all of the functionality in detail, provide rationale for why each function is necessary, and explain how it all ts together. To facilitate verication of code compliance, the specication must be comprehensive, detailed, and specic. A specication is complete enough if it can enable a software developer to create an implementation of the system without any other source of guidance.  Bugs and vulnerabilities in large and complex systems such as Pando and Compound for the Mixin Network are dicult to nd, and the probability of implementation errors going unnoticed is high. Ideally, bugs should be identied at the protocol layer before code is written. A well-written specication facilitates reasoning about the protocol design independent of its implementation.

It is possible to input data of incompatible size in regard to block size into the removing PKCS #7 padding function, which can result in problems decrypting content in AES in CBC mode.  Impact  In its current usage, the adding PKCS #7 padding function is only used in test cases. Although it is a helper function, it should still be implemented correctly in case functionalities of the system are expanded in the future.  The removing PKCS #7 padding function is used in pkg/mtg/encrypt.go#L17 for decryption of business data and the memo eld. Since this comes through the network, input should be checked to stay functional. While in pkg/mtg/encrypt.go#L17 the compatibility to block size is checked, this should be done at the stage of removing padding, in addition to checks for emptiness.  Preconditions  To exploit this issue, incompatibly padded data can be sent through the network, which would be tested for decryption.

Impact  The impact can include, but is not limited to, a loss of users funds, price and market manipulation, and service interruption depending on the number of nodes out of the total number of nodes involved going rogue.  Preconditions  A minimum of M MTG nodes out of N MTG nodes getting hacked and taken over or a minimum of M MTG nodes out of N MTG nodes colluding.  Technical Details  The quorum is implemented via an M-of-N multi-signature scheme.

As pre-commits fall off from the eviction process,  the attacker could resubmit and continue to block state updates.   Impact   This would allow anyone with the document data for the anchor to  pre_commit  and block updating that  document as a result. If this occurs, a document will not be able to complete an update that it would like  to  commit .    Feasibility   An attacker would be required to obtain a document and have knowledge of the    d next\u2212img     field. This  knowledge is intended to be kept to only the set of participants in the document. If the attacker is unable  to uncover this preimage, then they will not be able to  pre_commit  to prevent state updates that are of  concern to the owners of the document. However, if a counterparty finds a document disastifing to them  at any point, they may choose to lock the anchor and continue to relock it after the pre-commit eviction  time passes.    Technical Details   If an attacker is able to obtain a document in full, they could propose a  pre_commit  with the information  of   . This would likely be a counterparty of the document but could be due to an accidental leak   d next\u2212img     of the updates randomness. They could create a  pre_commit  for a specific  anchor_id  or  signing  root,  and if any legitimate participants of the document wish to then update the anchor, they would find  themselves blocked by the attackers pre-commits. Pre-commits last 800 (6 second) blocks and do not  require state rent but do require a transaction fee.   Mitigation   It may be possible for legitimate owners to fork the document by adding some extra salt to a leaf such  that they exclude a participant from a new document update. This is stated as a mitigation in the   Protocol  Limitations documentation . The documentation also notes that owners of the anchored document should  be trusted business partners in the initial implementation to reduce the likelihood of this attack.     Status   The Centrifuge team has stated that they consider this to be a protocol limitation. In the protocol  documentation, they note an assumption that counterparties are trusted and centralized business  partners and, as a result, these parties are not expected to behave in malicious ways. In the event one of  these parties acts maliciously and blocks a document update the document will be abandoned and a new  version created.    If counterparties are decentralized, we consider this to be a security issue that will negatively impact  participants of document updates and we strongly recommend that investigation into fraud proofs or  validity proofs be conducted in order to help prevent malicious actions.

To combat this, Centrifuge  implements the   transaction weights  functionality provided by Substrate. In addition, Centrifuge has  developed a specific state rent fee and eviction times that are an additional protection against state bloat  from anchor data being committed with little cost.    All fees will be based on a variable amount of tokens that transaction initiators are required to pay to  block proposers. This token will have a fluctuating conversion rate to fiat value that must be balanced  enough to equal a fiat cost imposed on the proposers that prevents spamming of transactions. Given that  the conversion rate could likely be volatile, particularly in the early blocks of the chain, this cost may not  be adequately priced at all times and the amount of token required to cover this cost based on fees will be  required  to fluctuate in some way. In Ethereum, these fees are decided by the miner and how much work  the miner is willing to take based on their assessment of the current value of the native token.   Impact   State storage and transactional computation  will be forced on nodes. If this is done recursively at little  cost as the value of the token used to calculate fees fluctuates, it could cause state storage to bloat and  create potential DoS issues by overwhelming full nodes.    Feasibility   There are preventative measures to ensure that data is not stored for indefinite time periods and all  transactions are weighted or incur some fee. This is only feasible if the fee is not priced correctly based  on the value of the token that the fee is paid in.   Mitigation   As the value of the chains currency fluctuates, we recommend continuing to investigate the economic  burden placed on custom functions to ensure that the cost of these functions prevents unwanted spam.   Status   The Centrifuge team intends to use a centralized form of governance to adjust fees as the value of the  native token fluctuates in the early stages of the chain.

Preconditions  An attacker would have to obtain the shared_preferences .xml or NSUserDefaults .plist le.  On Android, SharedPreferences data is stored on the lesystem, which could be exltrated by a rogue application or an unauthorized user, given physical access to the device. On iOS, NSUserDefaults and .plist les are not accessible to rogue applications, except in the cases where the device has been jailbroken or rooted.  Feasibility  With the availability of powerful hardware like CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs on the cloud, it is not dicult to brute force the key for various classes of weak passwords (e.g., low entropy, dictionary words, and others), particularly since SHA-256 is inexpensive on CPU resources (see Issue D).  Obtaining the shared preferences le, however, likely requires that the device has been successfully attacked previously. For example, as previously described, this could be done by means of physical access or a rogue application. Rogue applications have been historically identied in multiple application stores.  Security Audit Report | Mina Signer SDK + StakingPower Wallet | Mina Foundation 21 September 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  9  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Technical Details  Mina uses hierarchical deterministic wallets according to BIP44 to structure their wallet data in a client-agnostic way.  shared_preferences data is protected by lesystem user access control only and is stored in plain-text XML.  Mitigation  We recommend adding messaging to the EncryptSeedScreen widget that informs users of password best practices, the risk of choosing a weak password, and the risks of using a rooted device.  Remediation  We recommend adding password strength estimation to the form validation and prevent users from choosing weak passwords.  Status  The StakingPower Wallet team has added the password_strength package as a dependency and integrated it into the UI to show the user a password strength estimation based on length, characters used, and a top 10,000 dictionary.  Although this estimation is being done and presented to the user, it is not preventing the submission of weak passwords. In order to fully resolve the issue, we recommend that the StakingPower Wallet team prevent users from choosing weak passwords.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  ",

Synopsis  An AES-256 encryption key is derived from a user password for the purpose of encrypting the mnemonic seed. This key derivation function utilizes the SHA-256 hashing function, which is not a suciently secure algorithm for this purpose.  Impact  Leakage of all plaintext of an encrypted wallet is possible, including the wallet seed. This leads to the attacker being able to author transactions and steal funds.  Preconditions  The attack requires access to the encrypted wallet data (e.g. by reading the memory of a stolen device).  Feasibility  Cracking weak password hashes is a process that can be radically optimized (e.g. using FPGAs). While these require some know-how and upfront investment, they allow very high guess rates compared to their costs.  Technical Details  The SHA-256 hash function is, for multiple reasons, not an appropriate algorithm for deriving keys from passwords. Firstly, hash functions are not key derivation functions. They serve different purposes, even though key derivation functions usually are constructed from hash functions. Secondly, when deriving keys from passwords, memory-hard functions should be used, in order to make brute force attacks infeasible. Note that SHA-256 can be executed and parallelized not only on computers, but also on FPGAs, resulting in a signicantly lower power per guess ratio, which in turn leads to lower operating cost per guess ratio. Memory-hard functions help because they can not be parallelized well on FPGAs, GPUs, or specialized hardware.  Moving the burden of choosing a password that is secure with a simple key derivation function like HKDF to the user ignores that many users will not follow best practices when selecting a password. Entering passwords on phones can be tricky and prone to mistyping, which incentivizes users not to choose good passwords, which may in turn lead to insecure wallets. Additionally, the time needed to correctly enter a suciently secure password for a regular key derivation function is much longer than the time needed for a more secure password hashing function to run, leading to a net slowdown of the user. A memory-hard function key derivation function is more secure if the user chooses a weak password.  Remediation  We recommend using the Argon2id key derivation function, with the memory parameter set to 64MB, parallelism set to 4, and iteration count to 3.  Status  The StakingPower Wallet team has updated the MinaCryptor classs encrypt and decrypt methods to use Argon2id for key derivation and XChaCha20Poly1305 for encryption by default.

Clipboard is a global object that is accessible across application security boundaries. Any applications that are watching Clipboard will be able to see the mnemonic when the user copies it to Clipboard.  Impact  With access to the mnemonic, an attacker would be able to clone the wallet and take over all of its assets.  Preconditions  An application monitoring Clipboard when the mnemonic is copied. This is not an unlikely scenario, as many applications are known to do this by design. As of iOS 14, iOS noties users whenever another application accesses Clipboard. For an application to be targeting the mnemonics specically, a users phone would need to already have a malicious application targeting the StakingPower Wallet installed.  Feasibility  Clear APIs for viewing Clipboard are available for iOS and Android developers. Creating a Clipboard monitoring application would not be dicult. However, a more dicult task would be to compromise the phone of a Mina user. Additionally, if the user is using an iPhone with version of iOS >= 14, they would be notied when another application accessed Clipboard, alerting them that the mnemonic had been accessed.  Remediation  We recommend not allowing the mnemonic to be saved to Clipboard. Instead, we suggest requiring users to write down the mnemonic in a place off of the lesystem of their device.  Status  The StakingPower Wallet team has created an intermediary step that warns the user of the dangers involved with using Clipboard.

        "body": " [StakingPower Wallet]  Synopsis  On Android and some versions of iOS, the user or an application may record videos or individual frames from the StakingPower Wallet application.  The data displayed by the StakingPower Wallet is critical to both the security of the application and the privacy of the user. This data includes the mnemonic phrase, which is displayed during wallet key pair generation, and at any time after that in the backup screen. A leak of the mnemonic passphrase is a critical breach of the security of the wallet. Additionally, the wallet displays user account balance and transaction history, of which a malicious screenshot could leak private user data.  Private user data must be secured and protected from access by other applications running on the mobile device.  Impact  A malicious application accessing an image of the mnemonic phrase could result in loss of all wallet funds. In addition, account balance or transaction history leaks are a breach of user privacy.  Preconditions  The user must make a screenshot, and grant other applications access to the screenshot. Alternatively an application that has access to the contents of the screen (e.g. a screen recording application) would be required.  Feasibility  The feasibility of such an attack depends on the specic phone and operating system (OS).  On iOS 10 or newer, there is no API for an application to use to access the screen of another application, so this attack vector is not applicable. However, if the attacker plants a malicious application with access to the photo gallery on the device and the user makes a screenshot of the seed phrase or other private information, it is possible for the application to access it.  On Android, the MediaProjection API can be used to record the contents of the screen. The user has to explicitly consent to the access, and during the duration of the screen recording, an icon is shown.

Additionally, any application with access to the les of the user can access all screenshots.  Mitigation  We recommend that measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of screenshots be taken, as detailed below.  Android  On Android, we recommend setting FLAG_SECURE on the application window and ensuring that no private content is shown in other windows. For more information, we suggest referring to this blog post about vulnerabilities of weak screenshot protection. It appears in the past the techniques used to prevent screen capture in Flutter have occasionally failed, however, the easiest way to enable it may be the flutter_windowmanager package. However, we do recommend testing the setup on multiple devices and Android versions to verify that the packages function correctly.  iOS  On iOS, there is no API to prevent screenshots, which makes mitigating this issue more dicult. In some instances, the only thing that can be done is to remind the user that taking screenshots of the seed means making it available to other applications. In other cases, such as the seed generation screen, stronger measures could be taken. In this case, the iOS event UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshotNotication can be handled to display a notice to the user that the action is not secure, and to generate and display a new seed. With this approach, instead of preventing the screenshot of a seed that is used, using a seed that is screenshot is prevented. ScreenShieldKit also warrants mention in this case as a potential resource for preventing screenshots.  Status  The StakingPower Wallet team has implemented a mix of prevention and notication strategies to prevent unnoticed capturing of sensitive information.  Android  On Android, the client protects the contents of the screen showing sensitive information using FLAG_SECURE. While the screen can still be recorded using adb on some devices, this vector is usually not available to attackers.  iOS  On iOS, screenshots on such screens are detected and the user is warned.

Findings  General Comments  We commend the QuipuSwap development team for their achievements in implementing an ambitious system design. Additionally, we found that QuipuSwap utilized the Ligo language in interesting and innovative ways. Similar to other complex smart contract systems, QuipuSwap warrants further and ongoing analysis for potential vulnerabilities as applications in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are rapidly evolving.  Review Scope  Our teams review of QuipuSwap covered the smart contracts system design and implementation, including conguration processes, deployment of the contracts, potential attacks resulting from the possibility for improper conguration and exploitation of the usage of lambdas, and the implementation of the standardized FA1.2 and FA2 interfaces. In addition, we examined common attack vectors against this functionality and veried the post-deployment operation of the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) contracts, such as the use of executing stored code.  Although the scope of the review was sucient, there are a few areas that have been identied throughout the report for further review and analysis. These include the use of oating point operations, the JavaScript dependencies, and the voting and veto functionality, along with a more broad exploration of the potential interactions between contracts, such as modelling them as nite state machines.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  4  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   System Design  Multi-stage Deployment  Our team has observed the QuipuSwap system design to be particularly complex in a number of ways. The system uses a multi-stage deployment process: it deploys the Factory contract, congures it by adding the desired functions, then uses it to deploy an additional DEX contract. This initial setup consists of different phases and relies on a number of steps being executed in a particular order, as opposed to issuing a single origination command for a typical deployment process. This process also increases the complexity of the implementation in several places, as it adds an additional level of abstraction to the code base (i.e. the contracts that are generated by the contracts found in the code base are being run as opposed to running the contracts themselves).  However, it is not clear if this multi-stage deployment process can be avoided, given the restrictions placed by Tezos on the amount of storage that can be used in a single transaction. Tezos contracts have hard-coded storage limits, which prove too low for the size of QuipuSwap contracts. Breaking up the process into multiple steps helps to ensure that each individual step stays below the storage limit. We recommend that the QuipuSwap development team explore future opportunities to simplify this approach if it is possible to do so.  Preprocessor Macros  Another source of increased complexity is the use of preprocessor macros, which congure functionality in individual components. While this design decision is warranted in that it helps avoid redundant and duplicated code throughout the system, the particular ways in which these macros are integrated throughout the code base cause the same lines of code to have different meanings in different contexts. This leads to increased diculty in reviewing or auditing the code, as a result, we suggest documenting all variations and the reasoning behind the design choices of those variations into a specication (Suggestion 1).  Token Voting Governance  The QuipuSwap Smart Contracts also use a governance system to control the baker. To our knowledge, token voting governance has not fully matured and may present incentivization challenges to effectively change state when needed. There may be a desire to extend token voting governance to other economic settings in pair contracts, which will also require careful incentive research. We encourage decentralized governance as an appealing solution to centralized power and vulnerability, which result from single points of failure. We recommend that the voting and veto functionality undergo more thorough and focused analysis.  Floating Point Operations  The oating point operations used in the QuipuSwap contracts might potentially lead to edge cases. They use arbitrary precision numbers, rounding operations, and divisions -- all of which are known to lack precision when done by computers. As a result, we recommend further manual analysis, testing, and verication of these computations.  Complex Contract Interactions  Due to the complexity of the system, more broadly exploring the potential interactions between the contracts by modelling them as nite state machines and using some form of invariant analysis would provide valuable insight into the overall security of the system.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  5  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Code Quality  We found that the code is well-organized and compartmentalized in a clean and logical way. The code has good test coverage for the intended scenarios and common failure cases. However, we recommend expanding test coverage to include all error cases. This allows for tests that purposefully fail when contracts execute them in order to determine if error conditions operate and catch problems as expected (Suggestion 4). We also suggest including additional test coverage for the functions in MetadataStorage (Suggestion 5).  Furthermore, tests in the QuipuSwap code base are currently run with npm. We recommend running tests with yarn, as it is expected to result in a less error-prone testing process (Suggestion 6). Finally, adding Continuous Integration (CI) to the development process would ensure tests are always run and help detect certain errors at an earlier stage of development (Suggestion 7). More extensive coverage of error cases allow developers and reviewers to understand both intended and unintended scenarios, thus reducing the risk of code errors that lead to security vulnerabilities.  Documentation  Due to the complexity of the system architecture, gaining a concise overview and deep understanding of the way in which individual functions work is not a simple, intuitive process. As a result, we suggest integrating additional code comments and documentation, as detailed below.  Some limited comments are present throughout the code base, however, additional and more extensive code comments would be benecial, particularly around the intent and usage of entry points and helpers (Suggestion 2). We found that error messages in the code report numeric codes, which can lead to a lack of clarity to what the error in question is and, as a result, makes troubleshooting the systems more challenging. We suggest clarifying the error message to include the causes of failure (Suggestion 3).  The existing project documentation is accurate and helpful. Nevertheless, given that certain design trade offs are required, resulting in increased system complexity, we recommend thoroughly documenting the overall system design and architecture, which would make the system more accessible to reviewers, contributors, and users of the code (Suggestion 11). In addition, better documentation of the interactions with other DeFi contracts would make the potential attack surfaces of such interactions more visible (Suggestion 9). Conducting and publishing more research on potential front-running attacks relating to Tezos would contribute towards mitigation against such attacks, even though it would not completely prevent their occurrence (Suggestion 10). As noted above, we recommend creating documentation that provides more detailed information on the intended behavior, functionality, states, and actions of the contracts, in order to facilitate a better understanding of the code by both security reviewers and contributors (Suggestion 1). Improvements to the documentation help to minimize potential human error as it relates to execution of the implementation, in addition to full comprehension by security reviewers of the code.  Dependencies  The QuipuSwap contracts are independent and self-contained such that they do not rely on external dependencies. However, we have identied several dependency concerns relating to the supporting JavaScript code used for testing and deploying the contracts. JavaScript package dependencies could be a security concern in this context, as there is no guarantee that all of them have been audited and maintained according to security best practices. We recommend that the JavaScript dependencies be further investigated and, where possible, well-known and previously audited dependencies should be used.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  6  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Additional Findings & Known Issues  Following the completion of the delivery of the Initial Audit Report, we conducted the Phase 1 Verication in which we identied one new issue and made one new suggestion.  We found that in the event that a shareholder does not interact with the contract for a period greater than thirty days, they would miss the opportunity for a reward, as the reward would not be updated with the correct frequency. As a result, we suggest tracking the number of reward cycles that have passed, so that calculating the missing reward is feasible and the opportunity for rewards can be retained (Issue A).  In addition, the QuipuSwap development team made signicant improvements to the documentation. We commend this effort and recommend including a proof-reading stage to the development of documentation, in order to eliminate grammatical errors, which would help ensure that information is being conveyed adequately, with clear and unambiguous denition (Suggestion 12).  Finally, upon request from the QuipuSwap team, we veried the resolutions to several known issues (Known Issues A - E) that were identied by the QuipuSwap team.  Specic Issues, Suggestions, & Known Issues  We list the suggestions found during the review, in the order we reported them. In most cases, remediation of an issue is preferable, but mitigation is suggested as another option for cases where a trade-off could be required.

Known Issue A: Divestments With Zero XTZ Causes Tezos Error  Known Issue B: XTZ to Token Ratio Can Be Manipulated During\u2026  Resolved  Resolved  Known Issue C: Parameters to Liquidity Divestment Call are Ignored  Resolved  Known Issue D: Users Able To Empty Token Reserves In Transfer\u2026  Resolved  Known Issue E: High Initial Liquidity Causes Prohibitively Expensive Shares  Resolved  Issues  Issue A: Shareholders Lose Opportunity for Rewards if Not Interacting with Contract  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L99  Synopsis  Every thirty days, a user is intended to receive a proper share of additional XTZ received from the delegation of the XTZ pool. This reward is provided to the user upon interaction with the contract, rather than calculated all at once. This is done to prevent a large gas cost being added to the operation for updating the reward information for all users. However, this means that a user would miss out on the reward if they do not interact with the contract for a period greater than thirty days, as the reward would not be updated with the correct frequency.  Preconditions  A user must be owed an award, but have not claimed that award via any actions with the contract that would trigger update_user_reward. Then, another reward cycle must pass, such that usually a user would be marked to receive another reward, but here the state would be unchanged due to the user already being marked.  Remediation  A possible solution would be to keep track of the number of reward cycles that have passed. If a user is several cycles behind, this will be reected in their number of shares being unchanged and would allow for calculating the missing reward.  Status  The QuipuSwap team has responded and noted that, due to the operation size limit in Tezos, they have simplied the rewards model in order to decrease complexity and mitigate baker rewards distribution issues inside the protocol. In implementing the new rewards system, they collect all the baker rewards and simple XTZ transfers on the contracts for 30 days (a single cycle) and then distribute them in the next 30 days, during which the contract collects the rewards for distribution in the next iteration. Once users receive share tokens, they begin to receive rewards proportionally to their shares in the pool. We have veried that the mechanism of dispersal has changed and is no longer subject to this issue.  Verication  Resolved.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Suggestions  Suggestion 1: Document the Specications of Contracts  Synopsis  The descriptions of major entry points contained in the README le can be considered an informal specication. However, expanding the documentation to provide more detailed information about actions that the contracts are expected to perform, intended behavior and functionality, and any illegal and/or unauthorized inputs and states they should be handling would facilitate a better understanding of the code.  Mitigation  We recommend documenting a specication of the QuipuSwap system, particularly specifying the calculations for and invariants in the following actions:   Invest liquidity;  Divest liquidity;  Conversions between tokens;  Rewards;  Withdrawals of prots;  DEX functions;  Token functions;  Vote; and  Veto.  Status  A signicant amount of documentation has been added, providing helpful information on the available functions and the possible circumstances which may result in failure.  It would additionally useful to document both the FA2 and the FA1.2 contracts, in order to easily assess the implementations adherence to the respective specications. This is of particular importance for the FA2 contracts since the FA2 standard (TZIP-12) has not yet been nalized, thus it is critical to understand what version of the specication is in use for the implementation.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  Suggestion 2: Expand Code Comments  Location  update_owner and update_metadata in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo  middle_dex, middle_token, and use_default in contracts/partials/Dex.ligo  wrap_transfer_trx, set_dex_function, and set_token_function in contracts/partials/Factory.ligo  get_token_metadata_registry and update_operators in contracts/partials/MethodFA12.ligo  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  9  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Synopsis  Further clarications on the intent and usage of the main entry points and helpers functions would assist in reasoning about these functions and would limit the potential for misinterpreting their intended function.  Mitigation  We recommend adding or expanding code comments for the main entry points and helpers functions.  Status  Comments have been added to provide background information and context for much of the functions. In larger functions, such as launch_exchange in Factory.ligo, intermediate comments that have been added to allow for an easy understanding of the intended behavior.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 3: Better Dene Error Messages  Location  Uses of failwith(01)and similar in:  contracts/partials/Factory.ligo  contracts/partials/MethodFA12.ligo  Synopsis  The current error messages resulting from failures report numeric codes, which do not make explicitly clear the reason for the error in question. Instead, a system using transparent error messages would facilitate easier understanding and troubleshooting of the failure.  Mitigation  We recommend implementing more transparent and informative error messages, such as explicit error strings or descriptions of the cause of the failure.  Status  The error messages have been updated and more clearly dened, providing the user with information such as where the failure occurred and the reasoning for its occurrence.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 4: Add Tests for Error Cases  Location  /test  Synopsis  For each use case, tests are currently run for a single successful scenario and check for expected values when the system is used as intended, but are absent for expected failures.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  10  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   For example, the test for swapping tokens does a single swap and checks that the expected tokens are moved in the correct way. This could be expanded to encompass several scenarios where failure is expected, such as attempting to swap tokens that do not exist for the pair, trying to swap Tezos in a token only swap, or trying to swap amounts that are not aligned with the provided liquidity.  Finally, comprehensive test coverage helps to identify simple errors and prevents functionality from breaking when new code changes are introduced into the implementation, which minimizes the potential for errors leading to security vulnerabilities.  Mitigation  Create tests that will purposefully fail when the contract executes them, in order to explore if error conditions operate and catch problems as expected.  Status  The test suite has been updated, including a number of expected failure cases along with correct functioning under intended usage.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 5: Add Test Coverage for MetadataStorage  Location  /test  Synopsis  The test suite does not exercise functions implemented in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo.  Mitigation  Expand test coverage to exercise functions in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo.  Status  Tests have been added to cover the MetadataStorage contract, including both successful expected behavior and failure cases.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 6: Implement Testing with yarn  Synopsis  Running tests via npm run test has been an error-prone process. Our team made several attempts to run npm run test in a variety of environments, including local and cloud virtual machines, different operating systems, and Docker. In each of these instances, npm failed to install certain dependencies necessary in order to run the test suite. The QuipuSwap development team suggested using yarn test (present in pull request 11 of QuipuSwaps GitHub project) as an alternative to npm run test, which has worked as a more suitable alternative.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  11  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Mitigation  Switch to yarn for running tests.  Status  The test suite has been updated and now runs using yarn.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 7: Add Continuous Integration to Development Process  Synopsis  The QuipuSwap project on GitHub lacks CI to run tests on new commits in the project. Implementing CI helps to prevent certain classes of issues early on in the development process.  Mitigation  Use CI to automatically run tests on new commits to the GitHub repository.  Status  QuipuSwap now utilizes Github Actions for continuous integration for all contracts.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 8: Consider using Formal Verication  Location  contracts/partial/Factory.ligo  Synopsis  Since QuipuSwap performs computations that involve arithmetic rounding and arbitrary precision numbers, formal verication of those specic computations may help prevent a subclass of correctness issues. We recognize that formal verication will not be able to detect and prevent all classes of security and correctness issues, as focusing only on safety properties of specic areas of execution may not be able to fully dene complex state machines or their interaction with other contracts. Logic issues may still arise even with extensive formal verication as illustrated by the recent Aave vulnerability.  Mitigation  We recommend that formal verication be considered for QuipuSwap. Projects similar to QuipuSwap, such as Uniswap and Dexter, have been formally veried. At this time, we do not have a particular recommendation for a specic formal verication tool or approach, however, we recommend that various approaches be further investigated.  Status  The QuipuSwap development team is investigating formal verication for Quipuswap, and will reassess the possibility of utilizing it at a later stage in the project. They have stated that they agree it is an important step for ensuring the validity and correctness of contracts on the Tezos blockchain.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  12  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Unresolved.  Suggestion 9: Document Complex Contract Interactions  Synopsis  Explicit documentation on how the QuipuSwap exchange may interact with other DeFi contracts would make the potential attack surfaces of such interactions visible.  For example, if a contract relies on the QuipuSwap exchange rates for a price feed as an oracle, they may be attacked by price manipulations if price checkpoints and the ability to time weight the price feed is not present. This attack could be facilitated with a ash loan.  Mitigation  We suggest documenting the capabilities of other projects to use the QuipuSwap platform and the mitigation methods that it provides, if applicable, against known DeFi oracle price manipulation attacks.  Status  The documentation has been updated so that it provides some insights into the limitations of QuipuSwap, alongside its features and  expected interactions with the larger DeFi ecosystem. The documentation includes additional information on the various participants that make up a QuipuSwap exchange and their interactions.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 10: Document Front-Running Attacks As They May Relate To Tezos  Synopsis  Issues associated with bots attempting to order transactions in sandwich attacks (front-running and back-running) and other front-running attacks have been prevalent in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Front-running is dicult to address in Ethereum, or arguably any open ledger, due to anonymity/pseudo-anonymity, the predictable nature of transaction ordering in the client, public nature of the memory pool of transactions, and the inability to obfuscate the contract code.  Mitigation  This is an interesting problem that may have different consequences on the Tezos ledger than the Ethereum ledger. We suggest doing more research in the area of front-running attacks on the Tezos ledger and referencing the latest known research on the Ethereum ledger, specically related to sandwich attacks. While this research does not provide a solution to sandwich attacks that are free from user experience tradeoffs, documenting the challenge on the QuipuSwap DEX as it relates to the sandwich attack would be a rst step towards mitigation.  Status  The QuipuSwap development team provided existing papers investigating the possibility of front-running attacks and an analysis of the QuipuSwap governance system. Though the existence of these documents resolves this issue, we recommend including them in the QuipuSwap documentation to make them more easily accessible.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  13  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 11: Document Overall System Architecture  Synopsis  In addition to the existing documentation on the API endpoints, documenting the high-level functionality of the system as a whole and how it is expected to be used would help explain some under-documented functionality (e.g.what problems voting is intended to solve) to end users, security reviewers, and potential developers.  Mitigation  We recommend accompanying the architectural diagram with a less-technical introduction to the project and its goals, as well as a high-level description of the different functionality and how it is expected to work within the system.  Status  The QuipuSwap online documentation has been updated to provide additional information on the system architecture, including architecture diagrams, high-level entity interaction diagrams, and QuipuSwap's smart contract API.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 12: Improve Documentation Readability  Location  https://docs.quipuswap.com/  Synopsis  The documentation and code comments have a number of grammatical errors, which may result in confusion about the intended meaning. For example, the Prices and Fees section has a lot of helpful information, but the process of understanding it is slowed due to assumptions of knowledge and terminology, and grammatical errors adding further ambiguity.  Mitigation  Adding a proof-reading stage to the development of documentation, optimally by a technical reader who is not working on the QuipuSwap project, would help ensure that information is being conveyed adequately, with clear and unambiguous denition.  Status  Improvements to the documentation readability have not been made at the time of this verication. We encourage the QuipuSwap team to adopt documentation best practices, as suggested, in order to improve readability and understanding of their system.  Verication  Unresolved.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  14  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Known Issues  Known Issue A: Divestments With Zero XTZ Causes Tezos Error  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  If a user calls divest_liquidity with a small number of shares, such that the amount of XTZ returned would be zero, Tezos generates an error message due to an empty transaction.  Remediation  Prevent divestments from amounting to zero XTZ, which will prevent this condition from being raised and avoid triggering the undened behavior.  Status  Users have been prevented from withdrawing if the divested XTZ is equal to zero.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue B: XTZ to Token Ratio Can Be Manipulated During Operation  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  When the user divests liquidity, the price of the token will almost always need to be truncated down, which will cause the ratio, or the invariant, to change over time. This can cause the token to effectively increase in value. There could also be the opposite effect such that, when divesting liquidity, the amount of shares is so small that the amount of tokens withdrawn would be zero. Compounding many operations of withdrawing XTZ without withdrawing tokens could result in dramatic changes in ratio.  Remediation  Preventing the withdrawal of tokens when the number of tokens divested would be zero prevents the situation where the ratio change could be dramatic, with many compounding operations.  Since oating point operations will always be imperfect, changes of value during divestment are unavoidable. For example, whether withdrawing 2.1 and 2.9 tokens, it will be rounded down to 2.0 tokens. The value  of XTZ lost in this operation  could be a large difference depending on the ratio. While this could be accepted as standard operation of the contract, a check could be put in place to ensure that this difference does not exceed a specic threshold.  As the invariant is updated after operations that modify the XTZ in reserve, this should not cause a desynchronization with the value of the token during contract operation. In general, we do not believe that this value should skew too much in any one direction. Many operations are present that modify the ratio in various directions and there will be nancial incentives that correct this over time.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  15  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Status  A check has been added to prevent the withdrawal of XTZ without tokens. Currently, there are no checks in place regarding the divergence implicit with divesting liquidity, however, we do not consider this to present negative security implications.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue C: Parameters to Liquidity Divestment Call are Ignored  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  Calls to divest_liquidity accept min_tez and min_tokens parameters, but no check is performed to ensure the divested amount conrms to the users expectation.  Remediation  Add checks to ensure that the XTZ and tokens being divested are equal to or greater than the specied values.  Status  The divest_liquidity function now includes a check to make sure the divested amounts conrm to the users expectation.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue D: Users Able To Empty Token Reserves In Transfer  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L439  Synopsis  When users initiate a transfer that supplies XTZ in exchange for tokens, it is possible to entirely empty the contracts token reserves. This has the side effect of locking the contract, since many operations will be broken if the token balance is 0, thus causing an innite price ratio.  Remediation  Prevent users from being able to transfer out the entire token supply by limiting the amount of the token pool able to be purchased at any given time. Additionally, add a check that prevents the token pool from having the ability to reach zero.  Status  A limit has been added to prevent users from transferring out more than one third of the token pool in a single transaction. In addition, this prevents the pool from ever reaching zero. Due to the way Tezos handles division, attempting to transfer out tokens when the value is 2 or less would be blocked for being greater than a third of the pool.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  16  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue E: High Initial Liquidity Causes Prohibitively Expensive Shares  Location  contracts/partials/Factory.ligo#L25  Synopsis  Since the amount of initial shares is hardcoded to be 1000, it is possible to provide a signicant amount of initial liquidity, causing the cost per share to be prohibitive to most participants. This results in the entire exchange being controlled by a small number of users.  Mitigation  Have a variable or congurable amount of initial shares for the contract. Setting the number of shares equal to the initially provided XTZ (in mutez) prevents the cost of an individual share from being too expensive. Depending on intended behavior, it could also potentially be valuable to set a minimum number of initial shares, to ensure that the creator of the exchange starts with a competitive number of shares, but this does not represent a security issue.  Status  The initial shares are now variable, based on the amount of XTZ provided during exchange creation.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

They have stated that they agree it is an important step for ensuring the validity and correctness of contracts on the Tezos blockchain.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  12  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Unresolved.  Suggestion 9: Document Complex Contract Interactions  Synopsis  Explicit documentation on how the QuipuSwap exchange may interact with other DeFi contracts would make the potential attack surfaces of such interactions visible.  For example, if a contract relies on the QuipuSwap exchange rates for a price feed as an oracle, they may be attacked by price manipulations if price checkpoints and the ability to time weight the price feed is not present. This attack could be facilitated with a ash loan.  Mitigation  We suggest documenting the capabilities of other projects to use the QuipuSwap platform and the mitigation methods that it provides, if applicable, against known DeFi oracle price manipulation attacks.  Status  The documentation has been updated so that it provides some insights into the limitations of QuipuSwap, alongside its features and  expected interactions with the larger DeFi ecosystem. The documentation includes additional information on the various participants that make up a QuipuSwap exchange and their interactions.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 10: Document Front-Running Attacks As They May Relate To Tezos  Synopsis  Issues associated with bots attempting to order transactions in sandwich attacks (front-running and back-running) and other front-running attacks have been prevalent in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Front-running is dicult to address in Ethereum, or arguably any open ledger, due to anonymity/pseudo-anonymity, the predictable nature of transaction ordering in the client, public nature of the memory pool of transactions, and the inability to obfuscate the contract code.  Mitigation  This is an interesting problem that may have different consequences on the Tezos ledger than the Ethereum ledger. We suggest doing more research in the area of front-running attacks on the Tezos ledger and referencing the latest known research on the Ethereum ledger, specically related to sandwich attacks. While this research does not provide a solution to sandwich attacks that are free from user experience tradeoffs, documenting the challenge on the QuipuSwap DEX as it relates to the sandwich attack would be a rst step towards mitigation.  Status  The QuipuSwap development team provided existing papers investigating the possibility of front-running attacks and an analysis of the QuipuSwap governance system. Though the existence of these documents resolves this issue, we recommend including them in the QuipuSwap documentation to make them more easily accessible.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  13  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 11: Document Overall System Architecture  Synopsis  In addition to the existing documentation on the API endpoints, documenting the high-level functionality of the system as a whole and how it is expected to be used would help explain some under-documented functionality (e.g.what problems voting is intended to solve) to end users, security reviewers, and potential developers.  Mitigation  We recommend accompanying the architectural diagram with a less-technical introduction to the project and its goals, as well as a high-level description of the different functionality and how it is expected to work within the system.  Status  The QuipuSwap online documentation has been updated to provide additional information on the system architecture, including architecture diagrams, high-level entity interaction diagrams, and QuipuSwap's smart contract API.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 12: Improve Documentation Readability  Location  https://docs.quipuswap.com/  Synopsis  The documentation and code comments have a number of grammatical errors, which may result in confusion about the intended meaning. For example, the Prices and Fees section has a lot of helpful information, but the process of understanding it is slowed due to assumptions of knowledge and terminology, and grammatical errors adding further ambiguity.  Mitigation  Adding a proof-reading stage to the development of documentation, optimally by a technical reader who is not working on the QuipuSwap project, would help ensure that information is being conveyed adequately, with clear and unambiguous denition.  Status  Improvements to the documentation readability have not been made at the time of this verication. We encourage the QuipuSwap team to adopt documentation best practices, as suggested, in order to improve readability and understanding of their system.  Verication  Unresolved.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  14  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Known Issues  Known Issue A: Divestments With Zero XTZ Causes Tezos Error  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  If a user calls divest_liquidity with a small number of shares, such that the amount of XTZ returned would be zero, Tezos generates an error message due to an empty transaction.  Remediation  Prevent divestments from amounting to zero XTZ, which will prevent this condition from being raised and avoid triggering the undened behavior.  Status  Users have been prevented from withdrawing if the divested XTZ is equal to zero.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue B: XTZ to Token Ratio Can Be Manipulated During Operation  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  When the user divests liquidity, the price of the token will almost always need to be truncated down, which will cause the ratio, or the invariant, to change over time. This can cause the token to effectively increase in value. There could also be the opposite effect such that, when divesting liquidity, the amount of shares is so small that the amount of tokens withdrawn would be zero. Compounding many operations of withdrawing XTZ without withdrawing tokens could result in dramatic changes in ratio.  Remediation  Preventing the withdrawal of tokens when the number of tokens divested would be zero prevents the situation where the ratio change could be dramatic, with many compounding operations.  Since oating point operations will always be imperfect, changes of value during divestment are unavoidable. For example, whether withdrawing 2.1 and 2.9 tokens, it will be rounded down to 2.0 tokens. The value  of XTZ lost in this operation  could be a large difference depending on the ratio. While this could be accepted as standard operation of the contract, a check could be put in place to ensure that this difference does not exceed a specic threshold.  As the invariant is updated after operations that modify the XTZ in reserve, this should not cause a desynchronization with the value of the token during contract operation. In general, we do not believe that this value should skew too much in any one direction. Many operations are present that modify the ratio in various directions and there will be nancial incentives that correct this over time.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  15  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Status  A check has been added to prevent the withdrawal of XTZ without tokens. Currently, there are no checks in place regarding the divergence implicit with divesting liquidity, however, we do not consider this to present negative security implications.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue C: Parameters to Liquidity Divestment Call are Ignored  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L569  Synopsis  Calls to divest_liquidity accept min_tez and min_tokens parameters, but no check is performed to ensure the divested amount conrms to the users expectation.  Remediation  Add checks to ensure that the XTZ and tokens being divested are equal to or greater than the specied values.  Status  The divest_liquidity function now includes a check to make sure the divested amounts conrm to the users expectation.  Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue D: Users Able To Empty Token Reserves In Transfer  Location  contracts/partials/MethodDex.ligo#L439  Synopsis  When users initiate a transfer that supplies XTZ in exchange for tokens, it is possible to entirely empty the contracts token reserves. This has the side effect of locking the contract, since many operations will be broken if the token balance is 0, thus causing an innite price ratio.  Remediation  Prevent users from being able to transfer out the entire token supply by limiting the amount of the token pool able to be purchased at any given time. Additionally, add a check that prevents the token pool from having the ability to reach zero.  Status  A limit has been added to prevent users from transferring out more than one third of the token pool in a single transaction. In addition, this prevents the pool from ever reaching zero. Due to the way Tezos handles division, attempting to transfer out tokens when the value is 2 or less would be blocked for being greater than a third of the pool.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  16  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Verication  Resolved.  Known Issue E: High Initial Liquidity Causes Prohibitively Expensive Shares  Location  contracts/partials/Factory.ligo#L25  Synopsis  Since the amount of initial shares is hardcoded to be 1000, it is possible to provide a signicant amount of initial liquidity, causing the cost per share to be prohibitive to most participants. This results in the entire exchange being controlled by a small number of users.  Mitigation  Have a variable or congurable amount of initial shares for the contract. Setting the number of shares equal to the initially provided XTZ (in mutez) prevents the cost of an individual share from being too expensive. Depending on intended behavior, it could also potentially be valuable to set a minimum number of initial shares, to ensure that the creator of the exchange starts with a competitive number of shares, but this does not represent a security issue.  Status  The initial shares are now variable, based on the amount of XTZ provided during exchange creation.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

This reward is provided to the user upon interaction with the contract, rather than calculated all at once. This is done to prevent a large gas cost being added to the operation for updating the reward information for all users. However, this means that a user would miss out on the reward if they do not interact with the contract for a period greater than thirty days, as the reward would not be updated with the correct frequency.  Preconditions  A user must be owed an award, but have not claimed that award via any actions with the contract that would trigger update_user_reward. Then, another reward cycle must pass, such that usually a user would be marked to receive another reward, but here the state would be unchanged due to the user already being marked.  Remediation  A possible solution would be to keep track of the number of reward cycles that have passed. If a user is several cycles behind, this will be reected in their number of shares being unchanged and would allow for calculating the missing reward.  Status  The QuipuSwap team has responded and noted that, due to the operation size limit in Tezos, they have simplied the rewards model in order to decrease complexity and mitigate baker rewards distribution issues inside the protocol. In implementing the new rewards system, they collect all the baker rewards and simple XTZ transfers on the contracts for 30 days (a single cycle) and then distribute them in the next 30 days, during which the contract collects the rewards for distribution in the next iteration. Once users receive share tokens, they begin to receive rewards proportionally to their shares in the pool. We have veried that the mechanism of dispersal has changed and is no longer subject to this issue.  Verication  Resolved.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Suggestions  Suggestion 1: Document the Specications of Contracts  Synopsis  The descriptions of major entry points contained in the README le can be considered an informal specication. However, expanding the documentation to provide more detailed information about actions that the contracts are expected to perform, intended behavior and functionality, and any illegal and/or unauthorized inputs and states they should be handling would facilitate a better understanding of the code.  Mitigation  We recommend documenting a specication of the QuipuSwap system, particularly specifying the calculations for and invariants in the following actions:   Invest liquidity;  Divest liquidity;  Conversions between tokens;  Rewards;  Withdrawals of prots;  DEX functions;  Token functions;  Vote; and  Veto.  Status  A signicant amount of documentation has been added, providing helpful information on the available functions and the possible circumstances which may result in failure.  It would additionally useful to document both the FA2 and the FA1.2 contracts, in order to easily assess the implementations adherence to the respective specications. This is of particular importance for the FA2 contracts since the FA2 standard (TZIP-12) has not yet been nalized, thus it is critical to understand what version of the specication is in use for the implementation.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  Suggestion 2: Expand Code Comments  Location  update_owner and update_metadata in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo  middle_dex, middle_token, and use_default in contracts/partials/Dex.ligo  wrap_transfer_trx, set_dex_function, and set_token_function in contracts/partials/Factory.ligo  get_token_metadata_registry and update_operators in contracts/partials/MethodFA12.ligo  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  9  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Synopsis  Further clarications on the intent and usage of the main entry points and helpers functions would assist in reasoning about these functions and would limit the potential for misinterpreting their intended function.  Mitigation  We recommend adding or expanding code comments for the main entry points and helpers functions.  Status  Comments have been added to provide background information and context for much of the functions. In larger functions, such as launch_exchange in Factory.ligo, intermediate comments that have been added to allow for an easy understanding of the intended behavior.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 3: Better Dene Error Messages  Location  Uses of failwith(01)and similar in:  contracts/partials/Factory.ligo  contracts/partials/MethodFA12.ligo  Synopsis  The current error messages resulting from failures report numeric codes, which do not make explicitly clear the reason for the error in question. Instead, a system using transparent error messages would facilitate easier understanding and troubleshooting of the failure.  Mitigation  We recommend implementing more transparent and informative error messages, such as explicit error strings or descriptions of the cause of the failure.  Status  The error messages have been updated and more clearly dened, providing the user with information such as where the failure occurred and the reasoning for its occurrence.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 4: Add Tests for Error Cases  Location  /test  Synopsis  For each use case, tests are currently run for a single successful scenario and check for expected values when the system is used as intended, but are absent for expected failures.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  10  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   For example, the test for swapping tokens does a single swap and checks that the expected tokens are moved in the correct way. This could be expanded to encompass several scenarios where failure is expected, such as attempting to swap tokens that do not exist for the pair, trying to swap Tezos in a token only swap, or trying to swap amounts that are not aligned with the provided liquidity.  Finally, comprehensive test coverage helps to identify simple errors and prevents functionality from breaking when new code changes are introduced into the implementation, which minimizes the potential for errors leading to security vulnerabilities.  Mitigation  Create tests that will purposefully fail when the contract executes them, in order to explore if error conditions operate and catch problems as expected.  Status  The test suite has been updated, including a number of expected failure cases along with correct functioning under intended usage.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 5: Add Test Coverage for MetadataStorage  Location  /test  Synopsis  The test suite does not exercise functions implemented in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo.  Mitigation  Expand test coverage to exercise functions in contracts/main/MetadataStorage.ligo.  Status  Tests have been added to cover the MetadataStorage contract, including both successful expected behavior and failure cases.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 6: Implement Testing with yarn  Synopsis  Running tests via npm run test has been an error-prone process. Our team made several attempts to run npm run test in a variety of environments, including local and cloud virtual machines, different operating systems, and Docker. In each of these instances, npm failed to install certain dependencies necessary in order to run the test suite. The QuipuSwap development team suggested using yarn test (present in pull request 11 of QuipuSwaps GitHub project) as an alternative to npm run test, which has worked as a more suitable alternative.  Security Audit Report | QuipuSwap Smart Contracts | Tezos Foundation 9 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  11  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Mitigation  Switch to yarn for running tests.  Status  The test suite has been updated and now runs using yarn.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 7: Add Continuous Integration to Development Process  Synopsis  The QuipuSwap project on GitHub lacks CI to run tests on new commits in the project. Implementing CI helps to prevent certain classes of issues early on in the development process.  Mitigation  Use CI to automatically run tests on new commits to the GitHub repository.  Status  QuipuSwap now utilizes Github Actions for continuous integration for all contracts.  Verication  Resolved.  Suggestion 8: Consider using Formal Verication  Location  contracts/partial/Factory.ligo  Synopsis  Since QuipuSwap performs computations that involve arithmetic rounding and arbitrary precision numbers, formal verication of those specic computations may help prevent a subclass of correctness issues. We recognize that formal verication will not be able to detect and prevent all classes of security and correctness issues, as focusing only on safety properties of specic areas of execution may not be able to fully dene complex state machines or their interaction with other contracts. Logic issues may still arise even with extensive formal verication as illustrated by the recent Aave vulnerability.  Mitigation  We recommend that formal verication be considered for QuipuSwap. Projects similar to QuipuSwap, such as Uniswap and Dexter, have been formally veried. At this time, we do not have a particular recommendation for a specic formal verication tool or approach, however, we recommend that various approaches be further investigated.  Status  The QuipuSwap development team is investigating formal verication for Quipuswap, and will reassess the possibility of utilizing it at a later stage in the project. They have stated that they agree it is an important step for ensuring the validity and correctness of contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

Status   The development team implemented the remediation suggestion by adding a function that takes the  message bytes and signature from the remote signer and validates it against the public key. Additionally,  the function validates that the public key returned from the remote signer and the public key used to  initialize the public signer are identical.    Verification   Resolved.

In addition, they cannot be verified due to having no testing or  documentation of their intended behaviors. If these parsers are to convert Michelson expressions into the  official JSON representation , they currently handle many inputs incorrectly, such as proper representation  of integers, strings, or annotation. They also remove escaping on escaped inputs, which appears to be  unintended.   Additionally, these parsers do not attempt validate inputs and will not provide an error on basic syntactic  issues such as improperly nested parentheses or brackets. As a result, the functions cannot be used  safely and can be used to generate invalid and mangled outputs.   Furthermore, the construction and intended usage of these functions is confusing. It is unclear if  sexp2mic  and  ml2mic  are intended to have different behaviors or operate under different  circumstances. This is further complicated by how  ml2mic  will at times recurse into  sexp2mic  instead  of itself.    Impact   High/Unknown. It is unclear how these functions are expected to be used or how their results are  expected to be handled and, as a result, it is difficult to make accurate conclusions about the attack  surface. In cases where these functions are handling untrusted user input that has not been properly  sanitized, it is possible to imagine a malicious user exploiting them in order to generate Michelson JSON  that has radically different behavior from the input JSON string.    Remediation   At a minimum, the intended behavior of the functions should be properly documented. They should also  have comprehensive test coverage and follow the model of the local-forging integration tests, which  ideally compare against official values obtained via RPC.   As a suggestion, since writing secure and efficient parsers is challenging, it may be valuable to use a  parser generator or parser combinator library such as PEG.js with a typescript plugin, or tsPEG. This will  prevent many common mistakes, and result in code that is easier to write, read, maintain, and audit.

Bcryptos  randomBytes()  function unsafely and silently falls back to using  Math.random()  as the entropy source instead of native  crypto  based on the inclusion of a property in the global scope.   Impact   Critical.  Math.random()  is not a cryptographically secure random number generator and its use for  anything outside of testing significantly compromises the integrity of generated keys.   Preconditions   An attacker would need to have exploited some type of script injection vulnerability - either XSS, malicious  extensions, or rogue dependency.    Feasibility   Low-Medium. The feasibility of such an attack largely depends on the deployment of the code. If running  as a regular web application, the attack surface may be much wider than if running as a browser  extension with its own global context. In addition, many other factors such as browser, extensions  installed, and other factors may radically change the feasibility of this attack for better or worse.   Technical Details   Assuming access to the global scope, an attacker could then nullify the global  crypto.getRandomValues()  function (or if the user is running the application in a  browser that does  not yet support the WebCrypto API ). As a result, the library will automatically and silently fallback to using  Math.random()  if the attacker also satisfies the check  !process.browser &&  process.env.NODE_TEST === '1' .    Security Audit Report | Utility Libraries | ChainSafe 23 March 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   4   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        It is true that if an attacker already has access to the global scope they could likely wreak more havoc  than merely reducing the integrity of the RNG used for keygen, perhaps overriding  crypto.getRandomValues()  to return a static private key they control. However, an attack such as  this is far more likely to be noticed sooner than more covertly reducing the entropy used to generate many  users keys.   Mitigation   We have opened a  ticket upstream with bcrypto  to remove the use of  Math.random()  from the  conditional path in the module and place that testing code in the test suite instead. This would at least  prevent the silent compromise of the entropy source by manipulation of the global object.    In the meantime, and perhaps in addition to such an upstream fix, calling  Object.freeze(window.crypto)  to prevent other scripts from attempting to override the  getRandomValues  method. Additionally, having your own check for WebCrypto support is a good path.  Using the same check that bcrypto uses:   const crypto = global.crypto || global.msCrypto;    const HAS_CRYPTO = crypto && typeof crypto.getRandomValues ===  'function';   Performing this check before calling  randomBytes()  and throwing an exception or using SJCL or  another crypto library if no crypto support exists is a good patch until something is done upstream.   Remediation   Ultimately, this issue is about being resilient to script injection attacks. This is an area of active research,  but great progress has been made with SES (Secure EcmaScript), such as  Secure EcmaScript Shim  and  LavaMoat . Remediation of this issue boils down to further developments and stability in these (and  perhaps other) projects, browser-native secure execution sandboxes, etc.   Status   This issue was also reported  upstream in bcrypto  and was  fixed in bcrypt o . As a result,  Math.random() will no longer be a possible fall back path in the case of global scope tampering.  Tampering with global variables will now lead to an exception instead of possible silent compromise of  the entropy source for keys.    Verification   Resolved.   ",

Status  The XMTP team acknowledged the nding but stated that they will not implement the remediation for the following reasons:  1. This vulnerability cannot be exploited to give new origins access to the XMTP Snap. It can only be used to extend access for a previously authorized origin. It also cannot be exploited to extract the XMTP secrets from the Snap without some other exploit. This greatly limits the usefulness of an attack; In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to obtain enough permissions to modify the system time. Hence, the pre-conditions are non-trivial since broad access to the user's machine is required; and  2.  3.

The caller can specify parameters, such as iterations and required memory. However, the parameters chosen by the client are too low.  Impact  Setting low scrypt parameters more easily facilitates an attackers ability to successfully guess a low-entropy password. This would enable an attacker to unlock a users wallet, which can result in the loss of user funds.  Preconditions  A low-entropy password (which is common) and physical access to the encrypted wallet of the target.  Feasibility  This attack requires signicant computational resources but is technically feasible. This attack is economically feasible if the prots gained from compromising the wallet surpass the costs of the computational resources.  Technical Details  An established standard for scrypt parameters does not exist and the scrypt parameters in Venus are implemented as suggested in an article on scrypt parameters, written in 2017. The Venus implementation makes use of the scrypt parameter recommendations for interactive logins but uses scrypt for computing le encryption keys. These lower interactive login parameter settings produce much higher performance than what is required for unlocking a wallet, resulting in a much lower cost of computing hashes and decreasing the time needed to bruteforce the password.  Remediation  We recommend using a minimum of scrypt parameter N = 1 << 21.  Status  The Venus team has updated the scrypt N parameter to 1 << 21.

When attempting to unlock the wallet, the password is Keccak-hashed and compared against the stored hash. This operation is very ecient, which is not desirable. Optimally, checking a password should take a long time, in order to make brute-force and dictionary attacks dicult.  The fact that the wallet still contains the Keccak hash in locked states means that an attacker with access to a memory dump of a locked wallet is able to derive the wallet encryption key. If an attacker also has access to the encrypted wallet, this allows them to decrypt the wallet and obtain the secret key.  Additionally, secret keys are never cleared from the memory and may be moved by Gos memory management system or swapped to disk by the operating system, further reducing the security of the secret keys.  Impact  An attacker may get hold of the secret keys of a wallet.  Preconditions  The attacker needs access to the encrypted wallet, in addition to the API or memory of a locked wallet that has been previously unlocked and then locked.  Feasibility  The feasibility varies with the specic setting, but it is to be expected that the attack is possible, yet expensive if the preconditions are fullled. The economic feasibility would be determined by the expected reward of an attack, which may vary.  Technical Details  In Venus, the wallet encryption key is derived from the Keccak hash of the passowrd. Locking the wallet only removes the encryption key, but not the Keccak hash, leaving a critical value in memory. Computing the scrypt hash of a Keccak hash of a password is not a common practice, which we suspect is implemented to speed up the password checking process. This could be counterproductive because slower password checking mechanisms are a good protection against brute force and dictionary attacks.  Security Audit Report | Venus | Filecoin Foundation 29 June 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  10  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Keys are also never overwritten with zeros, and no other effort is made to secure secrets stored in memory (e.g. to prevent Gos memory management from copying memory segments arbitrarily). These may also be written to disk for swap and virtual memory, making the secret values even more accessible.  Given that all of these security issues can not be completely remediated, we recommend implementing both the mitigation and the remediation, as detailed below.  Mitigation  We recommend using memguard to protect keys in memory against Gos memory management and the operating systems swap, as well as protect against memory dumps. Memguard provides its own memory management, encrypts the memory contents, and sets a non-swap ag.  To mitigate against secrets written to swap, we recommend advising users to disable or encrypt swap on the machines that they use for Venus.  Remediation  We recommend that the implementation does not compute an intermediate hash and only computes the scrypt hash of the password. When locking, we recommend overwriting the value and all decrypted secrets with zeros.  Status  The Venus team has implemented a change such that all secrets that are kept in memory throughout the run of the program are stored in memguard protected memory. These measures cover the more feasible and likely scenarios of data leakage. However, secret data that is only kept temporarily is often still stored in memory that is managed by the Go runtime, allowing the opportunity for data leakage. While there are some instances where moving secret data from memguard managed memory to runtime managed memory can be avoided, we acknowledge that it is often not possible to use memguard managed memory when interfacing with external code. In this particular instance, the Venus team has no inuence on how allocations are performed externally.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  ",

Impact The use of non-standard libraries to handle sensitive functionalities introduces the potential for implementation errors and increases the possibility of a supply chain attack that may result in serious vulnerabilities.  Remediation  We recommend the use of standardized, trusted, and audited alternatives, such as SubtleCrypto.  Additionally, for the cases where the implementation uses SHA3-224, although it is not implemented in any of the WebAPI libraries to the best of our knowledge, SHA256 can be utilized instead, and the output hash can be trimmed with negligible impact on performance.  Status  The Generative Labs team responded that the npm package @noble/ed25519 is both recommended and user-friendly. While our team agrees with this statement, this Issue was identied in order to suggest alternatives for the usage of libraries, such as js-sha224 and js-sha3.

In addition, in specic cases, the IV can be public and retaining uniqueness can be sucient, according to [Dworkin07]. However, the current implementation uses parts of the derived secret key as an IV. Mixing the roles of the aforementioned two inputs can jeopardize the strength of the symmetric encryption algorithm used.  Impact  The purpose of an IV is to add randomness to the encryption process. If IVs are not unique, the security of the encryption is weakened. Attackers might be able to predict or manipulate the ciphertext, leading to potential data leakage.  Security Audit Report | MetaMask Snap | Generative Labs 30 August 2023 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  6  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Remediation  We recommend using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to generate an IV instead of reusing parts of the secret key.  Status  The Generative Labs team stated that decoding and encoding require consistent IV parameters, so the user's password is used as the original parameter for SHA256. However, our team found that the IV is still being derived from the password using SHA256 and is then converted to a Base64 string. While this approach is better than using a plaintext password as an IV, it is still not ideal. As noted in the synopsis of this Issue, it is generally recommended to use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation, and to ensure that there is no overlap between the secret key and the IV (which can be public or safely stored in plaintext format).

The batch cost is estimated by using pricing data from the CoinGecko oracle. The over-reliance on one oracle introduces a SPOF, which could compromise the Peggo Orchestrator by accident or through a grieng attack.

This means brute-force attacks can be sped up relatively easily using ASICs and FPGAs.  Impact  A successful brute force attack on the password based encryption compromises the private key.  Preconditions  The attacker has access to a locked, encrypted wallet.  Feasibility  Moderately feasible. The attack requires access to a hardware implementation (ASIC or FPGA) of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. The initial investment for an FPGA implementation is low to moderate.  Technical Details  The browser-passworder encryption library uses PBKDF2 to derive a key from a password. PBKDF2 is a standard for iterated invocation of a keyed hash function. The function used in browser-passworder is HMAC-SHA256. This function is purely CPU-bound, and can therefore be sped up using specialized hardware that has little memory. Such hardware is not very expensive and very energy ecient. In order to protect against brute-force attacks carried out with the help of such devices, a memory-hard function should be used. This makes brute-force attacks based on specialized hardware infeasible, because they require access to a considerable amount of fast memory. This increases both the hardware cost and the amount of energy required for the derivation, which minimizes the gap to the eciency of CPUs.  Security Audit Report | Auro Wallet Extension | Mina Foundation 6 August 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Remediation  We recommend using the Argon2id function for deriving keys from passwords. There are two possible approaches:  1. Provide a patch to browser-passworder to support Argon2id (see this GitHub Issue). 2. Derivation and encryption manually.  For deriving a key from the password, we recommend this Argon2id function library implemented with a memory parameter of 64 MB. Additionally, an iteration count (called OPSLIMIT by sodium) of 3 should be used. It is important to note that a longer processing time provides better protection against brute-force attacks.  For encryption of the browser extension storage, we recommend using the secretbox functions from libsodium.  Status  The Auro Wallet team has added code for a new encryption system based on Argon2id and AES-GCM. They also added automatic migration logic, in order to convert encrypted wallets in the old format to the new format. The security parameters of the Argon2 invocation t the use case. For the base64 conversion, a well-maintained, web-compatible implementation of the Buffer object from Node.js is being used.  Verication  Resolved.  ",

If a user inserts a double-quote () character into a memo eld, they can end the GraphQL eld that constrains the results and insert additional GraphQL code.  Impact  There are several strings that, when entered as a Memo string, result in the submission of an invalid transaction, which would be rejected by the Mina Network. We did not nd a string that would result in a changed destination or amount.  Preconditions  The attacker is able to choose the contents of the memo eld.  Feasibility  Depending on the context, this is very feasible. For example, a merchant may require a specic memo for matching the payment to the order. This may not be a deliberate attack, however, most strings containing quotes will fail.  Security Audit Report | Auro Wallet Extension | Mina Foundation 6 August 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Technical Details  The memo eld can be lled with arbitrary text. This text will then simply be inserted into the GraphQL mutation string, between two quotation marks. Since that text can also contain quotation marks, the structure of the GraphQL mutation can be escaped and thereby modied. This is referred to as GraphQL injection.  In this case, we did not nd a way to perform an attack with a very strong outcome, because the signature, which is also included in the mutation, is only valid for the correct data. Therefore, we only found attacks which resulted in failed transactions.  Such injections can be prevented by properly using the GraphQL named mutations and variables features.  Remediation  We recommend adhering to the best practice guidelines provided in the GraphQL documentation. Steps to avoid GraphQL injections include:   Use accepted naming conventions and avoid conventions where a mutation is named  MyMutation;   Use variables instead of inserting strings directly;  Mutations must be a static string; and  Remove the startFetchMyQuery function, then map the proper values to these variables using  the variables parameter of fetchGraphQL.

Impact  A user may not notice that it is possible to extract the private key from any unlocked wallet and, given this false sense of security, may be less careful than is warranted. This may lead to the compromise of their secret key and/or mnemonic, or the change of the password by an attacker.  Preconditions  The wallet must be unlocked.  Security Audit Report | Auro Wallet Extension | Mina Foundation 6 August 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  9  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Feasibility  The password can be easily extracted.  Technical Details  The password is stored in the memStore of the APIService. The internal state of this object can be inspected using the Chrome DevTools. Unfortunately, this is an inherent limitation of the execution environment and cannot be prevented.  In order to decide on what action is to be taken in order to reduce the risk of leaking the secret key and seed, two attack scenarios have to be considered, as detailed below.  First, consider a scenario where the password prompt remains in the wallet and a user believes it is secure. The user temporarily (because the user trusts the security of the password prompt) gives an attacker access to the wallet UI, and afterwards checks that no transactions were made. An attacker who is aware of this weakness and has experience with web extension development and debugging will be able to extract the secret key without the user noticing.  Second, consider a scenario where the password prompt is removed. The user is aware that they should not leave the wallet unlocked, but due to a lapse in operational security, the user leaves it open during a window of opportuning where the attacker has access to the wallet. The attacker does not need specialized knowledge to export the secret key.  The action to be taken is a trade-off between these risks. Both are real risks and an evaluation needs to happen in the context of the application and user base, which is ultimately a decision to be made by the software vendor.  Mitigation  One mitigation is to lock the wallet during these password prompts. Whenever an attacker rst tries to export the keys through the UI (instead of immediately going for a DevTools-based attack), the wallet would be locked and the attack prevented. This would prevent UI-based attacks and secure the password prompt. However, it would still be vulnerable to attacks where the attacker immediately uses the DevTools to exltrate the secret key or seed.  The user should, if possible, use a hardware wallet, as they categorically prevent the accessing and exltration of secret keys. If that is not possible in the specic context of the user, the user should be very careful not to leave the wallet unlocked.  Status  The Auro Wallet team has decided not to implement the mitigation as they feel this would reduce the usability of the application. Specically, if the mitigation is implemented and the user aborts the password prompt when attempting to view the mnemonic, they could not go back to the home screen without unlocking the wallet again. We encourage the Auro Wallet team to continue to evaluate solutions to resolve this issue. We also recommend that the Auro Wallet team recommend users to utilize a hardware wallet.

While the technique is not problematic, the functions that take the keys as arguments  are generally not compatible with this approach. Therefore, this approach is not as effective at mitigating  attacks as intended. In addition, we identified various places in the code where no security measures are  in place to store private keys, but plain  byte[]  is being used instead.   Impact   If the attacker manages to circumvent this current mitigation or is able to read private keys from insecure  byte[]  storage, they may gain access to wallet keys.    Preconditions   The operating system would need to page out the areas in memory that contain the key byte slices to a  pagefile and the attacker would need access to the file. The attacker would also need to be running code  on the device of the user. Depending on the security habits of the user and the design of the operating  system, it may suffice if the code of the attacker runs with user privileges.   Feasibility   The attacker would need to be able to analyze the pagefile or memory dump. This requires some  knowledge in the field of computer forensics.   Technical Details   C# has managed memory, which means that it is much easier to write memory-safe code. Memory safety  means that the possibility of double free, buffer overflows, and similar attacks is drastically reduced  through the use of a runtime. The memory is managed by the common language runtime (CLR). The CLR  may move or copy memory around, without the developer being able to prevent it, so perhaps surprisingly,  memory-safety introduces issues around the secrecy of the contents of the memory. This means that for  regular byte arrays, it is not possible to safely overwrite a key with zeroes. Additionally, memory may be  paged out to the pagefile at any time. This means that regular values stored in memory may be written to  disk.   Security Audit Report | Atomex: Core Library + Desktop Client | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   5   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        To address this issue for storing passwords in memory, Microsoft has added the  SecureString  class,  which stores a string such that is neither copied nor paged out. The Atomex team uses this class to write  SecureBytes , which securely stores binary data (such as keys) encoded as   in a  SecureString .  Although this is not a poor practice, the issue remains that all functions that use these keys for  cryptographic operations (e.g. key derivation, encryption or signing functions) are not able to use  SecureBytes .    Remediation   The  libsodium library  provides functions to allocate free memory that can not be paged out. There are  bindings to that library in C#, such as  NSec . We recommend using one of these to allocate unmanaged  memory before and overwrite it with zeros as well as free it after use.   Status   The Atomex team has changed  SecureBytes  to use memory allocated by libsodium. This mitigates  many of the possibilities to leak keys through memory dumping attacks. However, several cryptographic  operations still operate on plain byte arrays requiring keys to be converted to the less secure format, thus  creating an opportunity for moments of vulnerability. We recommend that further effort is invested in  finding and using, or possibly even implementing, operations that currently require insecure memory to  function, e.g. the BIP32-Ed25519 library.

Since the Atomex fork was made, more security checks  have been added to the original BouncyCastle code, specifically a low-order point check for all keys.  Furthermore, the code that has been forked is undocumented. As a result, given that BouncyCastle is  central to the security of the core library, it is critical that the code be regularly updated and maintained.    Impact   Issues in the cryptographic library used to create and verify signatures may be able to trick a wallet into  accepting invalid signatures, which are used to verify the validity of transactions.   Preconditions   Two preconditions are possible. First, the attacker may find a hole in the changes made to the  Ed25519  class by the Atomex team or, second, a security vulnerability in BouncyCastle is found and fixed, but not  merged by the Atomex team.   Feasibility   If the preconditions are met, an attacker with decent cryptographic knowledge would be able to attack  users. Significantly, in the case that a fix to a vulnerability in the BouncyCastle library is not merged into  Atomex, that vulnerability would be publicly visible.    Security Audit Report | Atomex: Core Library + Desktop Client | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   6   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Technical Details   BouncyCastle is a popular cryptographic library for Java and C#. However, the C# version appears to be  completely undocumented. The Atomex team has copied the class providing  Ed25519  signatures out of  the BouncyCastle project and made some changes.   The reason or purpose for the changes made and whether they are secure appears to be neither  documented nor discussed. Through extensive study of code, it becomes clear that the changes were  made because the API provided by BouncyCastle did not allow implementing BIP32-Ed25519  [KL17] , a  scheme for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. Specifically, BouncyCastle only allows using the  256-bit seed value as a private key, but not the 512-bit key (called the  expanded  key in BIP32-Ed25519),  which is required by BIP32-Ed25519.   Forking and maintaining a library, particularly one that includes cryptography, requires a considerable  amount of work and responsibility. Instead of modifying a library to match the project requirements, a  more pragmatic approach would be to choose a better suited library. Since BouncyCastle does not appear  to meet other requirements of the library, the Atomex team implemented the  SecureBytes  class to  protect keys in memory. However, BouncyCastle is not able to work with this type, thus making the keys  they try to protect vulnerable.   Remediation   Given that maintaining a fork requires significant effort, instead of using BouncyCastle, we recommend  using the NSec cryptographic library to implement BIP32-Ed25519, in which the API allows deriving secret  (expanded) keys from a seed as a secret key for signing. While the change to support BIP32-Ed25519  keys is considerable, it is significantly smaller than the current changes to BouncyCastle. The library also  resolves the issues around protecting keys in memory against getting paged out by exposing the  respective libsodium functions. In addition, using NSec provides free secure memory.   Status   Considering the current unavailability of a cryptographic library which immediately implements both  secure key handling and signing using Ed25519 with keys that are derived hierarchically deterministically  according to to BIP32-Ed25519, the Atomex team has decided to maintain BouncyCastle by tracking and  including changes made upstream. However, the Atomex team did not provide a clear process for this  undertaking. Instead, they implemented several changes to the files copied out of the BouncyCastle  project, including having the code align with their own code style (i.e. whitespace,  var -style declarations,  curly braces around single-line for loops, etc.). Furthermore, the new code added by the Atomex team is  scattered throughout the file, instead of kept mostly separate, which would have helped comparability. As  a result, we recommend that in the absence of a clear process for tracking and maintaining the  remediation be implemented in order to resolve this issue.   Verification   Unresolved.   ",

Synopsis   LiteDB is used to store wallet data on disk. The database has an encryption mode that is used by the  Atomex team. The security of the encrypted mode of LiteDB is severely flawed and can not be considered  secure.   Impact   An attacker may get access to the wallet data, including but not limited to, the secret values used in the  atomic swaps. The attacker may also change the client state by modifying the encrypted data in the  wallet. Combined with the vulnerabilities in  Issue D , this may also result in leakage of the wallet keys.   Preconditions   The attacker would need access to the encrypted LiteDB database. This is possible for any software  running on the disk with user privileges.   Feasibility   The attacker would need some understanding of applied cryptography at the same level as most  blockchain engineers. The attacker could catastrophically attack the encryption of LiteDB, compromising  the database in its entirety.   Technical Details   The encryption of LiteDB is based on AES-ECB, which is  known to be vulnerable  and should not be  considered secure. As a result, it should not be relied on for storing wallet data on disk. Furthermore, the  encryption is not authenticated, allowing the undetected modification of data. Additionally, the key  derivation process used to derive keys is PBKDF2 with only a thousand iterations. LiteDB also does not  specify which underlying function to use so the  default of HMAC-SHA1  is used ( SHA1 is broken and  should no longer be used ). As a result, this method does not provide sufficient protection against brute  force attacks.   Remediation   Rather than relying on LiteDBs encryption, encrypt the data manually before storing it. To do so, do not  use a password but an already strong key  K  instead. That key may be derived from a password, which we  discuss further in  Issue D .    To store an item I at address A in the database:   -  -  -  -  -  Compute the shadowed address   -  A = HMAC(K, addr || A)   Compute the encryption key for item I   -  K_I = HMAC(K, key || A)   Pick a 192 bit random nonce   -  N = rand(24)   Encrypt the item   -  I = secretbox_encrypt(K_I, I, N)   Store I at A   -  DB.Set(A, N || I)   To retrieve an item at address A in the database:   -  -  Compute the shadowed address   -  A = HMAC(K, addr || A)   Compute the encryption key for item I   -  K_I = HMAC(K, key || A)   Security Audit Report | Atomex: Core Library + Desktop Client | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   8   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.      -  -  Get the nonce N and the encrypted item I from the database   - -  N || I = DB.Get(A)  where N is the first 24 bytes of the results and I is the rest   Decrypt the item   -  I = secretbox_decrypt(K_I, I, N)   Use the  secretbox  functions provided by a library that provides bindings to libsodium, such as NSec.  This algorithm not only provides confidentiality, but it will also detect if an attacker attempts to modify the  data.   Status   The Atomex team implemented manual encryption of all stored items based on AES256-GCM.   Verification   Resolved.   ",

However,  we do not see a consistent strategy as different approaches and parameters are utilized in different  places. None of the parameters chosen are sufficient against brute force attacks.   Furthermore, keys derived from passwords are used both for database encryption and secure key  storage. This constitutes a form of key reuse, which can lead to cryptographic vulnerabilities.   Impact   An attacker may be able to brute-force the encryption keys of the database and secure key storage or  perform related-key attacks on AES itself. In each case, they would be able to learn at least parts of the  plaintext data.    Preconditions   The attacker would need access to the encrypted wallet. This is possible for any software running on the  disk with user privileges.   Security Audit Report | Atomex: Core Library + Desktop Client | Tezos Foundation 24 September 2020 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   9   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.        Feasibility   For the brute-force attack, the attacker would need sufficient computational power. Due to the insufficient  technique currently being used, this would be inexpensive, especially considering the potential rewards.  For related key attacks, the attacker needs profound cryptanalysis knowledge.   Technical Details   Most of the key derivations from passwords in Atomex use PBKDF2, but with varying iteration counts.  LiteDB uses an iteration count of 1024 (e.g. very low compared to the  100,000 iterations that were used  by LastPass in 2011 ), and before the user password is passed to LiteDB, it is iteratively hashed with  SHA256 ten times. The encryption and key derivation of LiteDB is discussed in  Issue C , yet the purpose of  this is unclear. One possibility is that should LiteDB corrupt the key, the original password is not affected.  However, the issue remains that if the attacker knows the tenth hash, it is still possible to brute-force the  password.   The AES class uses a default iteration count of 52,768, however, when the class is used in the classes  UserSettings  and  HdKeyStorage , it is overridden with 1024. This value is much too low.   In general, PBKDF2 has the weakness that it is parallel. As a result, memory-hard hash functions should  be used for deriving keys from passwords. They significantly increase the cost of parallelization.   Furthermore, in some instances keys derived from passwords are reused while in other instances the  derived keys are different but related, because the only difference is the iterated hash before the  derivation. Instead, a single key should be derived from the password, from which further keys are derived  using a regular key derivation function like HKDF.   Remediation  Derive a single key  K pw  from the password using Argon2id or Balloon Hashing. To choose the parameters,  follow the recommendations in Section 4 of the  RFC draft for Argon2 . As a guidance, memory sizes of 32  and 64 MB are common today. For each part of the system that requires a key (e.g. database encryption  or HdKeyStorage), derive a key from that using  HMAC-SHA256 . Use  K pw  as the key and a label describing  the user of the key as the message. For example, the key for database encryption  K db  would be computed  as follows:   K db  = HMAC-SHA256(K pw , database encryption)   Status   The Atomex team implemented our recommendation and, as a result, the Argon2id is used to generate a  key from the user's password. Furthermore, the key is calculated from the main key using  HMAC-SHA256  for any encryption.   Verification   Resolved.   ",

The default block  confirmation is set to one block in the Atomex core library, regardless of the underlying chain in  consideration. If the wallet is performing actions, and a chain reorganization occurs at a critical time of  the atomic swap, there could be a need for the wallet to recover and to rebroadcast a transaction or retry  a swap.   Preconditions   A wallet must be connected to a node that includes their transaction in a forked chain, and after one block  or more, the fork is reorganized to the canonical chain while transactions and actions taken by the client  have assumed that transactions are confirmed.    Feasibility   Blockchain reorganizations are more common on some chains than others. Given that they are frequent  in Ethereum due to low block time, this is likely to happen. Ethereum refers to these frequent forks as  ephemeral forks. While these forks are generally short, it may be possible that they are extended  unexpectedly.   Technical Details   Many checks before performing actions for swaps or other transactions are checked against a boolean  stored on the transaction called  isConfirmed . This boolean is set to  true  if the transaction has been  included in the blockchain and is greater than  DefaultConfirmations . With a default of one block of  confirmation, there are cases that a client is connected to a node that has not discovered a fork with a  heavier amount of observed work to it from other peers. If the state of a node the wallet is connected to is  not derived from the canonical chain, there is a chance that a transaction will be made and then later  removed due to a reorganization. The client database may get updated with a state that is now incorrect  and needs to be reconciled with the new fork. This might lead to very different swap outcomes (e.g. if a  timeout occurred on one branch and no time out on another).    Remediation   One approach would be to handle  DefaultConfirmations  differently for any chain and adhere to the  recommended minimum of blocks to wait before considering a transaction to be confirmed. The problem  with this approach is that there will be a longer delay on all transactions, which may affect the usability of  the Atomex swaps.   The other approach is to add checks to the core codebase. These additions would be checks for  reorganizations, database inconsistencies, and failed transactions over a longer period of time. The issue  with this approach is the added complexity to the implementation, however, this may be the safest route  and can be limited in scope to swaps within the default time span a swap may live, currently set at a  default time span of a maximum of 10 hours.

There is a function in the  SwapManager  class called  RestoreSwap  that appears to address this occurrence, as it checks the state  of the swap and will attempt to act on it accordingly. If the swap is active, meaning that it has not yet  reached the default payment timeout, the code will do nothing as it is not implemented.   Impact   This is a low priority issue as these swaps have not yet had payments broadcast to them so no funds are  at risk of being lost. Therefore, this would only lead to inconsistencies in the swap clients when a swap is  lost and needs to be retried before payments are made. A client may be stuck on a particular swap until  the swap timeout without the ability to continue.   Preconditions   An initiator client creates a swap and loses it before sending it to their counterparty and now must resend  the swap, or a recipient of a swap loses their swap and should now respond when it is recovered.    Feasibility   This is not highly feasible as the swap should be lost before any broadcasts of payments are made.   Technical Details   If a swap payment has not yet been broadcast and the time is still within the swap's timeout timestamp, a  method should exist for recovering the swap or re-initiating it by sending the swap to the recipient or by  re-accepting a swap sent to the client. Currently, the implementation does nothing and leaves the swap  there until the end of the default payment time where it would then be removed.   Mitigation   Implement the missing logic for re-initiating swaps in the case that payments have not yet been  broadcast to the chain.

These services have  rate limits that can be exceeded if clients overwhelm them with requests. And when these services are  overwhelmed, they have been known to be faulty and return timeouts.   On the Tezos side, services like  tzStats , or  Baking Bad  are used which do not enforce limits on the number  of calls or the amount of data one can query from the API. However, spam protection measures that limit  the number of connection attempts and HTTP calls over short time-frames are in place.    Impact   If the client wallets rely on a single blockchain service account and that account is open to take requests  from anyone, then the service could be rate limited and shut down or overwhelmed from general or  attacker traffic. This would block all wallets relying on that service from communicating with the  blockchain. This could come at opportune times for an attacker during the lifespan of a swap.   Preconditions   A large amount of traffic is sent to the services that the wallets rely on to interact with each chain,  causing the service to become overwhelmed and shut down for a period of time.   Feasibility   The stability of the blockchain API services has been known to be inconsistent for large amounts of  traffic making it likely that the use of the third-party service will experience failed requests.   Technical Details   The Etherscan API endpoint used has a  documented rate limit . The  Infura documentation  mentions that  all accounts have a rate limit and list how they score these limits. The recommended solution provided by  Infura is to reduce the amount of traffic if there is a rate limit response. In the Ethereum case, there are  two services to choose from if one is being faulty. An attack would need to send an excessive amount of  traffic to the services. If the services supplying the wallet are down for the default wait time for swap  redemption, an initiator of a swap may be able to deny their counterparty from responding in time.

If a client is compromised  before revealing the secret, this would allow a counterparty to be able to redeem a swap and cancel their  end before the other party can reveal and claim their swap.   Impact   Loss of swap funds as one party is able to derive the pre-image before it is revealed.   Preconditions   The attacker must be able to compromise the victim's computer and read the insecure preimage bytes  from memory.   Feasibility   This is not highly feasible as the preimage secret is only sensitive in the beginning of the swap and the  attacker must compromise the target machine.   Technical Details   A crucial component of an atomic swap protocol is the commit reveal stage of a secret. This secret  ensures that a counterparty is not able to redeem a locked amount of funds before the other party is able  to secure their side of the swap. For example, if A initiates a swap, they will lock funds into a contract with  the image of a secret. Party B will then not lock their side of the funds into a contract that requires  revealing the preimage to the image that A created and attempt to compromise A. This area is the primary  concern for the security of a swap. If B is able to deduce the image of the swap before the swap timeout  that A created, B may then redeem As lock without deploying Bs side of the swap contract.   Mitigation   Use a method such as those recommended in  Issue A  to ensure that the preimage is also kept in a secure  and encrypted state.   Status   The team responded with clarification that the client software will not be initiating atomic swaps,  therefore it is unnecessary to protect the secret in memory as by the time the client receives it from the  blockchain, the secret is meant to be public.

Synopsis  The Taho Wallet Extension currently makes use of PBKDF2, which is a purely CPU-bound key derivation function. This class of algorithms has been considered insuciently secure for several years because it is embarrassingly parallelizable.  Impact  The limitations of PBKDF2 may result in leakage of vault contents (i.e. mnemonics and secret keys), which can then be compromised by an attacker and result in the loss of user funds.  Preconditions  The attack requires access to the encrypted vaults, and this could happen through two vectors:  1. a malicious website extension could circumvent browser security measures; and 2. a regular program running with user permissions can usually access the browser prole and, thus,  all extension data.  Feasibility  The feasibility of the attack depends on the strength of the password. Argon2 provides security benets particularly for weak passwords, which could realistically be guessed by brute force.  Technical Details  PBKDF2 is a function that derives keys from passwords, and the function iteratively calls a normal hash function (in this case SHA256). Therefore, it has a tight loop and only requires a small amount of memory. This can be eciently parallelized and even implemented on a eld-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specic integrated circuit (ASIC) with relatively minimal effort.  The newer class of memory-hard hash functions avoids this problem by accessing a large amount of memory, which is always cost prohibitive to implement in hardware.  Remediation  We recommend using the memory-hard Argon2id function instead of the currently implemented PBKDF2. In the Argon2 RFC, as noted in [BDK+21], guidance is provided for the choice of parameters. We suggest selecting t=3 iterations, p=4 lanes, m=2^(16) (64 MiB of RAM), 128-bit salt, and 256-bit tag size (i.e. the second recommended option).  In addition, we suggest performing the computation in WebAssembly (e.g. using the argon2-browser package).  Status  The Taho team has migrated to using the argon2-browser package to encrypt secret vaults and has also implemented functionality to re-encrypt existing vaults upon the rst time that the respective user unlocks their vaults.

Impact  If Multi-Party Computations (MPC) are not performed successfully, depending on the timing of the attack and the conguration of the smart contract, the adversary could be able to submit malicious transactions.

The size of this batch is not taken into account in the call's assigned weight.  Impact  Maliciously crafted transactions could cause excessive load, degrading network performance.  Feasibility  Straightforward.  Technical Details  All extrinsics (runtime calls) added by the Sygma Substrate pallets are assigned a xed weight of 195,000,000. The call execute_proposal takes the Vec<Proposals> argument, representing a batch to process in a single transaction. In order to verify the MPC signature on this batch, it must be converted from its Rust representation to the original form by the function construct_ecdsa_signing_proposals_data. This operation uses time and space linear in the number of proposals and is accessible to anyone by design. A malicious user could thus craft very large transactions (containing invalid proposals) in order to negatively impact the network's performance while paying disproportionately low fees.  Remediation  The number of proposals passed to the execute_proposal function should be factored into the call's weight calculation. Alternatively, the number of proposals per transaction could be limited, with a check performed before the function construct_ecdsa_signing_proposals_data is called.  We recommend benchmarking the performance of all calls and assigning weights based on the results.  Status  The Sygma team removed the without_storage_info macro but noted that without_storage_info is also used on the access-segregator, basic-fee-handler, and fee-handler-router pallets.

However, there are two exceptions:  1.  If the chunk or PSS message is sent from a node with Proximity Order (PO) 0, the node must be an originator of the chunk/message.  2. Light node can only be the originator as light node can not forward chunk/message.  Security Audit Report | Bee + Bee Clef | Swarm Association 26 November 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  7  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Impact  Nodes with PO 0 or a light node would be an easy target for a deanonymization attack, which could result in leaks of network meta data (e.g. IP, location) through Kademlia DHT. This network metadata could enable other attacks including DoS attacks and censorship attacks. However, this deanonymization attack would not reveal the contents of the chunk/message.  Preconditions  A chunk/PSS message is sent by a node of PO 0 or a light node to the attacker node.  Feasibility  The feasibility of this attack depends on the number of attacker nodes. For every attacker node, there is a 50% percent chance of being the PO 0 node. The probability of a successful attack is linear in the number of attacker nodes.  Mitigation  The following are potential approaches to mitigate this issue:   Use a proxy node to hide the sender node. The limitation of this approach is that if the proxy node  is attacked, the sender node will be deanonymized or taken down.   A Bee node owner can use network layer anonymization tools such as Onion routing, mixnet, or  others to connect to the Swarm network.   The planned spoof-resistant overlay addressing to mitigate neighborhood mining will also reduce  the feasibility of an attacker generating a large number of malicious nodes.   A more comprehensive mitigation to this class of deanonymization attacks is to attract as many  nodes to the network as possible, thus reducing the chance of sybil attacks leading to deanonymization attacks.  We recommend that the Swarm team continue to improve the incentive mechanism, including Swap and postage lottery, in order to attract more users to the network and increase overall security.

Security Audit Report | Bee + Bee Clef | Swarm Association 26 November 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  8  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   Preconditions  The attacker nodes occupy the neighborhood of the victim node in an eclipse attack by mining addresses in the neighborhood and capturing the chunks sent to or from the victim node.  Feasibility  The probability of capturing a neighborhood is low, as there is an upper bound of neighborhood depth. Although currently not implemented, spooess address features that may be introduced in the future could make mining addresses in a specic neighborhood prohibitively dicult and expensive.  Technical Details  Attacker nodes occupy the neighborhood; any chunk/message sent to or from the victim node will be captured by the attacker, thus capturing the sender overlay address and other network meta data such as IP address and location. This data leak could result in other kinds of attacks such as DoS, censorship attacks, and others.  Remediation  We recommend taking steps to make address mining costly as a mitigation for eclipse attacks. We note that spooess addresses are proposed for implementation. This step would make address mining costly, although Ethereum miners can still mine addresses by manipulating the block hash.  We also note that the neighborhood depth upper limit makes occupying a neighborhood dicult. Additionally, the chunks/messages content is encrypted, therefore the contents link to its sender and receiver would not be revealed. Furthermore, it is very dicult for an attacker to distinguish a normal chunk from a PSS message (a Trojan chunk), further obfuscating the message.  Status  The Swarm team has implemented spooess overlay network addresses, which use the Ethereum blockhash (one block after the block that contains the node's chequebook transaction) as a source of randomness for overlay addresses, which strongly discourages address mining. Theoretically, however, Ethereum miners can still be bribed to mine addresses in a specic neighborhood by ltering addresses which do not lie in the victim nodes neighborhood. The current implemented mitigation makes that action prohibitively expensive and dicult to control, as it is dicult for the miner to mine two consecutive blocks. However, in order to fully resolve the issue, the Swarm team needs to make address mining impossible by implementing a better source of randomness for address derivation (e.g. beacon chain RANDAO in Eth 2.0), which is not available in Eth 1.0. Thus, we recommend that the Swarm team continue to explore new options as they become available to fully resolve the issue.  Verication  Partially Resolved.  ",

Feasibility  Moderate. A forwarder node is incentivised not to forward the chunk and claim the reward. Alternatively, a single owner chunk could be censored if somehow the attacker knows its a feed chunk, even without incentive.  Technical Details  An attacker node receives a chunk from another node. The attacking node drops or discards the chunk and passes back a forged receipt indicating that the chunk was stored successfully. The attacking node would then be eligible to claim a reward via the SWAP protocol.  Remediation  We recommend implementing a change where the uploader and forwarder (who caches the chunk incentivised by SWAP) can verify uploading/forwarding (push-sync) by retrieving a chunk through an alternative route after a successful forwarding within a random amount of time. If the retrieval fails, the node can push/sync the cached chunk through an alternative route.  Status  The Swarm team has responded that implementing the suggested remediation is non-trivial due to the cost and the signicant required change to the architecture, in addition to making syncing slow and unreliable. They note that guaranteeing disjoint path traversal for retrieval and push is complex and dicult to achieve. In addition, the Swarm team does not want to introduce cross protocol dependency (relying on the forwarder) as it would introduce additional complexity. Instead, they are working towards identifying and implementing solutions that would result in a more reliable syncing process that is less susceptible to manipulation (i.e. the uploader veries the upload and resends chunk via a disjoint path if the verication fails). We acknowledge their decision and agree that the proposed solution would be sucient, as long as the disjoint path is not blocked by a blackhole attack. Our suggested remediation is an extension of this approach. Given that a solution has yet to be implemented and veried by our team at this time, this issue remains unresolved.

Mitigation  We recommend not adding batches that have a value equaling total cumulative payout (amount per chunk =0) or batches that are going to expire (small amount per chunk value) within the next couple of blocks.  Remediation  We recommend allowing the batches with a zero or small amount per chunk value to enter the batch store, which increases the reserve radius. However, reserve radius should decrease once the batch with small values is evicted, and previous queued valid batches should be dequeued (unmarked) from being evicted.

        "body": "  Location  src/dogecoin.cpp  src/wallet/wallet.cpp  src/primitives/transaction.h  src/policy/policy.cpp  Synopsis  Version 1.14.5 changes the rules with respect to Dust outputs in a way that could cause certain transactions that were previously \"stuck\" to unexpectedly be executed, specically during a software upgrade.  Impact  This issue could result in the unintended transfers of funds.  Preconditions  The issue is possible if low-output transactions were left pending under the assumption that they had failed permanently.  Technical Details  Version 1.14.5 introduces signicant changes to the rules relating to transaction outputs of very low value, also referred to as \"Dust.\" Aside from adjustments to the associated fees, which are effectively advisory, it includes a change to the network consensus about what constitutes a legal (so-called \"standard\") transaction. Any consensus change merits careful investigation, especially with respect to the evolution of the rule in question.  Transaction outputs below a certain value were rst prohibited in Dogecoin with version 1.14.0, likely unintentionally as part of the very large code integration leading to that version (cf. pull request 1587). Due to an inconsistency in the code, that version could create transactions that were technically legal, but carried less fees than the network generally required for their inclusion in the blocks. Such transactions could conceivably remain pending in wallets for an indeterminate length of time.  Historically, Dogecoin had allowed Dust outputs but required extra \"penalty\" fees for their processing. The amount of such fees, as expected by miners and relays to admit a transaction, is computed by the function GetDogecoinDustFee. During transaction creation by CWallet::CreateTransaction, the function CTxOut::IsDust is used to determine if that transaction requires the extra fees.  IsDust, however, is also used by IsStandardTx as part of determining whether a given transaction is legal with respect to the network consensus. While fee requirements are up to the individual node operator, any transaction not satisfying IsDust cannot be accepted. Due to a discrepancy between the  Security Audit Report | Dogecoin Node Upgrade 21 April 2023 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  5  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   calculation in IsDust and that of GetDogecoinDustFee, version 1.14.0 could create transactions that did not satisfy IsDust and would be created without penalty fees but for which GetDogecoinDustFee would report these penalties as required. Consequently, such transactions, if created by the wallet, would never be accepted by relays and miners.  This discrepancy prompted the release of version 1.14.2, which based the calculation of GetDogecoinDustFee on the result of IsDust. At the same time, the threshold used by IsDust was raised to one coin, the value previously used by GetDogecoinDustFee. This, again, changed the network consensus, likely unintentionally.  The adjustments in version 1.14.5, nally, relaxed the consensus to an extent that the legacy transactions in question have become both valid and acceptable with respect to their included fees. As a result, they will likely be processed whenever the new version (re-) attempts their submission to the network, typically upon starting the software.  As of version 1.14.5, a \"hard Dust limit\" of 0.1 cent is imposed for any standard transaction. Below a \"soft limit\" of one cent, miners and relays will normally require the inclusion of penalty fees. Finally, the wallet software conservatively uses the newly introduced discard threshold of one coin by default as its effective Dust limit to remain compatible with network nodes that still run on version 1.14.4 or earlier.  Mitigation  As a matter of course, any pending transactions whose execution is no longer desired must be properly canceled. This can be accomplished, for example, by waiting for any desired transactions to complete, shutting down the node, and restarting it with the -zapwallettxes and -rescan command-line interface (CLI) arguments. The -zapwallettxes argument causes all transactions in the wallet to be deleted and -rescan searches the blockchain for any missing transaction history. See this related issue for further details.  When transactions become stuck in the wallet and need to be replaced, we recommend ensuring that the replacement transaction consumes the same transaction outputs as the original, so that the original becomes invalid by virtue of the replacement being accepted.  We also further recommend that due diligence be undertaken during version upgrades.

In this scenario, the benet remains in the fact that any backup of the wallet can be used to regenerate all account keys, even those that are not contained in that backup.  While Dogecoin allows extracting all keys, including the HD seed, from a wallet via the dumpwallet command, its converse importwallet does not recognize the contained seed value and there is, as of version 1.14.5, no provision to specify it.

        "body": "  Location  src/policy/policy.h  Synopsis  The internal parameter that congures the network consensus on the hard Dust limit is derived indirectly from the recommended transaction fee. A change of the fee recommendation could thus inadvertently cause a consensus change.  Impact  This issue could cause the network to fork and user transactions to become stuck.  Preconditions  This issue is possible if the constant RECOMMENDED_MIN_TX_FEE is changed in the code while the constant DEFAULT_HARD_DUST_LIMIT is derived from it.  Technical Details  As discussed in Issue A, the hard Dust limit is a network consensus parameter. It is set in the code from the constant DEFAULT_HARD_DUST_LIMIT. This is set to one tenth of DEFAULT_DUST_LIMIT, which, in turn, is dened as equal to RECOMMENDED_MIN_TX_FEE. The latter was introduced as a general base constant from which other fee values are derived in order to clarify their relationship. As we have outlined, however, fee policies are fundamentally different from network consensus. A change to the latter would  Security Audit Report | Dogecoin Node Upgrade 21 April 2023 by Least Authority TFA GmbH  11  This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.   force out any node not compliant with it, effectively fragmenting the network. At the least, users running outdated software versions would nd their transactions unable to complete.  As Issue A has demonstrated, consensus changes are not to be made lightly. The naming (recommended) and placement (with other fee policy parameters) of RECOMMENDED_MIN_TX_FEE make it harder than necessary to realize that a consensus change would result from its modication.  Mitigation  Users can change their nodes hard Dust limit via the -harddustlimit CLI parameter. We recommend that node operators closely monitor the network so they can react to unexpected parameter changes.  Remediation  We recommend that Dogecoin developers separate the denition of DEFAULT_HARD_DUST_LIMIT from RECOMMENDED_MIN_TX_FEE.  Status  The Dogecoin development team has acknowledged this issue and noted that, while the recommended mitigation will not be implemented at this time, it will be taken into consideration for future releases.

        "title": "Issue A: The BN254 Curve Provides Insufficient Security",
        "body": "   Location   /CMakeLists.txt#L47-L53   Synopsis   Loopring uses a variant of the BN254 curve. In 2016, advances in number theory led to a lower security  estimate of that curve. Specifically, its security is now considered to be around 96 bits. This is  significantly lower than the 112 bits required by NIST for new products.     Impact   Use of the BN254 curve undermines the security of the zk-SNARK scheme, such that the feasibility of  computing valid, forged proofs cannot be ruled out. Such proofs would pass validation, yet violate the  constraints imposed by the circuit. For example, a valid, forged proof could increase or reduce the  balance of accounts arbitrarily.    Preconditions   In Loopring, only proofs published by the operator are considered. As a result, an attacker needs access  to the operators keys, either through being the operator or through having gained access to them by  different means.   Feasibility   The exact feasibility is difficult to estimate. However, the potential gains from a successful attack are  high, which suggests that an attacker would have incentive to invest significant resources.   Technical Details   Attacks based on the Tower Number Field Sieve (TNFS) and the derivative exTNDS and SexTNFS have led  to a reduced estimate of the security level of BN254. The several scholars and practitioners working on  this issue do not entirely agree on the new estimate, but opinions range from 96 bits to 110 bits [ KB15 ,  MSS16 ,  BD17 ,  Perrin16 ]. Regardless of where on this spectrum the real value falls, it is still too low. Even  for applications that only need to remain secure until 2030, NIST requires a security level of at least 112  bits [ B20 , Table 4], which BN254 does not achieve.   Mitigation   This attack can be detected, however, it would require that one or more parties permanently check for  forged proofs.    Remediation   We recommend using the curve BLS12-381. According to the draft RFC on pairing-friendly curves [ Sakemi  et al. 20 ], it has a security level of ~128 bits, which is above the 112 bits considered sufficient by NIST  until 2030.    The Berlin hard fork, which is planned to take place in January 2021, will bring precompiled contracts  support for operations on this curve. This will make using the curve viable. Given the potentially high   Security Audit Report | Loopring 3.6 Design + Implementation: Circuit | Loopring 16 March 2021 by Least Authority TFA GmbH   7   This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.          incentive for launching such an attack, running a new trusted setup computation to generate a required  common reference string for BLS12-381 should be strongly considered. As a result, we recommend this  approach as an appropriate long-term solution for Loopring.    Status   The Berlin hard fork upgrade will no longer contain EIP-2537, as originally planned at the time we  delivered the  Initial Audit Report . As a result, 384 bit arithmetic in the EVM (i.e. EVM-384) is currently  unavailable. Given this change, there is currently no efficient method for secure pairing based  cryptography that is able to achieve at least 112 bits of security as required by NIST for new products.  Thus, a long-term remediation is not currently possible and we recommend that the Loopring team  continue to monitor developments with EIP-2537.    Verification   Unresolved.   ",
